Abstract
Textual data is at the forefront of information management problems today. One response has been the development
of visualizations of text data. These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word
frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of
document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create
a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the
IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries
at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom,
selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text.

1. Introduction
‘What is this document about?’ is a common question when
navigating large document databases. In a physical library,
visitors can browse shelves of books related to their interest, casually opening those with relevant titles, thumbing
through tables of contents, glancing at some pages, and deciding whether this volume deserves further attention. In a
digital library (or catalogue search of a traditional library)
we gain the ability to coalesce documents which may be located in several areas of a physical library into a single listing of potentially interesting documents. However, the experience is generally quite sterile: people are presented with
lists of titles, authors, and perhaps images of book covers. In
feature-rich interfaces, page previews and tables of contents
may be browsable. If the library contents are e-books, users
may even open the entire text, but will have to page through
the text slowly, as interfaces are often designed to present
a page or two at a time (to dissuade copying). Our goal in
this work is to bring some of the visceral exploratory experience to digital libraries, to provide interactive summaries
of texts which are comparative at a glance, can serve as decision support when selecting texts of interest, and provide
entry points to explore specific passages.

Prompted by the ever increasing volume and open access
to digital text, developing overviews of document content
has been an active research area in information visualization for many years. However, reported works do not make
use of existing richly studied linguistic structures, relying
instead on simple statistical properties of documents (e.g.,
[AC07]), or analytic methods such as latent semantic analysis (e.g., [DFJGR05]), which can produce unintuitive word
associations. The resulting visualizations provide detail on
content without a consistent view that can be compared
across documents. In DocuBurst, we provide a complement
to these works: a visualization of document content based
on the human-annotated IS-A noun and verb hierarchies
of WordNet [Fel98] which can provide both uniquely- and
consistently-shaped glyph representations of documents, designed for cross-document comparison (see Figure 1).
2. Related Work
2.1. Document Content Visualization
Visualizations of document content take two common forms:
synoptic visualizations for quick overviews and visualizations specialized for discovering patterns within and between documents. Specialization in the type of document

used as input further divides the reported research: books
and long documents, historical documents, multilingual
texts, and computer-mediated communication archives such
as emails, instant messages, and threaded discussions. In
this space, DocuBurst focuses on long texts, such as books,
and provides a visualization that is simultaneously synoptic,
comparative, and allows for deeper intra-document analysis
of occurrence patterns. In the remainder of this section we
will review significant examples in each of these categories,
describing how their feature sets compare.
Synoptic visualizations of text most often use a selected
subset of the language to create a glyph based on word occurrence counts. Glyphs are then combined in small multiples visualizations to perform comparisons. Glyph techniques include Starstruck [HWMT98], which creates glyphs
by arranging lines of varying length in a circular pattern,
and Gist Icons [DFJGR05], which builds on this idea by
drawing a smoothed contour around this pattern. The vocabularies used are either restricted user-selected term sets
(Starstruck) or automatically selected and potentially unrelated (Gist Icons). Subtle shape perturbations can be hard to
compare in side by side radial glyphs. Other synoptic visualizations of document content use space-filling techniques
to provide an overview of the vocabulary a single document,
such as TextArc [Pal02] and tag clouds (e.g., [Fei08]). These
techniques provide a quick overview of document content.
A second category of document visualizations are
those created to reveal patterns within texts. FeatureLens
[DZG∗ 07] suggests repeated phrases that may be of inter-

est, and visualizes selections, while Arc Diagrams [Wat02]
provide an overview of repetition throughout a document.
DocuBurst also provides views of the distribution of selected
words. Other pattern-based visualizations focus on distributions of significant features in a document such as emotion
(e.g., extensions [OBK∗ 08] of TileBars [Hea95]), or handannotated properties (e.g., Compus [FD00]). The Word Tree
[WV08] is an example of a pattern-based visualization focused on repetition in context. While Word Trees provide a
unique view on repetition, overall word frequencies and full
document overviews are not visible.
To compare document visualizations, we order a list of
the types of features document visualizations have provided
from most unique to DocuBurst to the most common in other
visualizations:
semantic
cluster
overview
zoom
freq
compare
search
read
pattern
features
suggest
phrases
all words

indicate word meaning
generalize by clustering words into concepts
provide quick overviews of an entire text
support varying the semantic or graphical detail
reveal frequency of individual words
compare multiple documents
search for specific words/phrases
drill-down to original text
reveal patterns within or between texts
reveal extracted features (e.g., emotion)
suggest interesting focus words/phrases
can show multi-word phrases
can show all parts of speech

Figure 2 summarizes how these features relate to
DocuBurst and other well known text visualizations. Note
that only DocuBurst provides some reflection of semantics through integrated word definitions and the use of a
semantically-defined linguistic structure. Only DocuBurst
and Gist Icons provide word clustering into higher concepts,
however in Gist Icons the groups are only one level deep

and based on statistical measures whose meaning may not
be readily apparent to a reader. Note that all visualizations
that provide overviews of entire text suffer from screen real
estate issues with large texts.
2.2. Graph Drawing
Radial graph-drawing techniques have been previously reported and serve as the basis of this work. Of particular interest are the semi-circular radial space-filling (RSF) hierarchies of Information Slices [AH98] and the focus + context interaction techniques of the fully circular Starburst visualization [SZ00]. The InterRing [YWR02] visualization
expands on the interaction techniques for RSF trees, supporting brushing and interactive radial distortion. TreeJuxtaposer [MGT∗ 03] illustrates methods for interacting with
very large trees, where nodes may be assigned very few pixels. We adapt techniques such as tracing the path from a node
of interest to the root and performing interactive accordion
expansion from this work.

in English WordNet (v2.1), rooted under the synset {entity}
having 73, 736 nodes (synsets) and 75, 110 edges, and a maximum depth of 14. Verb hyponymy is also supported — that
hierarchy is smaller and takes a more shallow, bushier form.
In addition, there is no single “root” verb. The visualizations
produced can be generalized to any partial order of a lexicon.

3.1. WordNet Visualization
Many interfaces for WordNet exist, the most popular of
which is the text-based WordNet Search which is part of
the publicly available WordNet package. With the exception of the work of Kamps [KM02], the existing interfaces
for WordNet either provide for drill-down textual or graphical interaction with the data starting at a single synset of
interest or provide path-tracing between two synsets e.g.,
[Alc04, Thi05]. We do not know of any visualization of
WordNet that uses the graph structure to enhance a visualization of other data such as document content.

3. Background on WordNet

4. DocuBurst Visualization

Despite the growing dependence on statistical methods,
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques still
rely heavily on human-constructed lexical resources such as
WordNet [Fel98]. WordNet is a lexical database composed
of words, collocations, synsets, glosses, and edges. Words
are literally words as in common usage. A collocation is a
set of words such as “information visualization” which are
frequently collocated and can be considered a unit with a
particular definition. For the purposes of this paper, we will
use words to refer to both words and collocations — they
are treated equally in the visualization. Sets of synonymous
words and collocations are called synsets. Glosses are short
definitions that the words in a synset share, thus they are
definitions of synsets. An edge in WordNet represents a connection between synsets.

The combined structure of WordNet hyponymy and document lexical content is visualized using a radial space-filling
tree layout implemented with prefuse [HCL05]. Traversing
the tree from center to periphery follows a semantic path of
increasing specificity using the IS-A relation. In WordNet,
synset members are ordered according to their polysemy
count, which WordNet researchers call familiarity. Since
more familiar words come first, we chose the first word in
a synset as the node label. Label fonts are maximized, rotated to fit within the node, and overlap is minimized.

Synsets are the most important data unit in WordNet.
Throughout this paper, we will refer to words in single
quotes (e.g ‘thought’), and synsets using a bracketed set
notation (e.g. {thought, idea}). A word may be a member
of multiple synsets, one for each sense of that word. Word
senses are ranked, either by order of familiarity (a subjective judgement by the lexicographer) or, in some cases, by
using a synset-tagged reference corpus to provide numerical
relative frequencies.
Synsets in WordNet are connected by many types of
edges, depending on the part of speech (noun, verb, etc.).
WordNet contains 28 different types of relations, but the
most widely used part of WordNet is the hyponymy (IS-A)
partial order. An example of hyponymy is {lawyer, attorney}
IS-A {professional, professional person}. When traversing
this graph, we remove any cycles (they are very rare) by
taking a depth-first spanning tree at the user-selected root.
In this work we focus on the noun hyponymy relationships

4.1. Linguistic Processing and Scoring
In order to populate a hyponymy hierarchy with word
counts, several pre-processing steps are necessary. Starting
with raw text, we subdivide the text into tiles based on
the pre-existing structure, such as section headings. If no
structure is detectable, we break the text into roughly coherent topic segments using a segmenter [Cho00]. For each
tile, we label parts of speech (NOUN, VERB, etc.) [Bri93].
Nouns and verbs are then extracted and stemmed (e.g., books
→ book, going → go) using a morphological processor
[Did03]. Punctuation is omitted. If short word sequences,
noted in WordNet, are found in the document, the words are
combined into a collocation, and treated as a single word.
Next we look up in which WordNet synsets the (word,
part-of-speech) pairs occur. Because pairs usually occur in
multiple synsets, we do not perform word sense disambiguation. Instead, we divide the word count amongst the available
synsets. If WordNet supplies relative sense frequency information for a word, we use this to distribute the count. Otherwise, we distribute the count weighted linearly by sense
rank. This results in weighted occurrence counts that are not

integers, but the overall results more accurately reflect document content. By dividing the counts, we dilute the contribution of highly ambiguous terms. The full text of tiles and
their associated (word, part-of-speech, count) triples are then
read into the data structure of the visualization.
4.2. Visual Encoding
Node Size
Within the radial tree, angular width can be proportional to
the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at that node (leaf
count) or proportional to the sum of word counts for synsets
in the subtree rooted at that node (occurrence count). The
leaf count view is dependent on WordNet and so is consistent
across documents. The word count view maximizes screen
space for synsets whose words actually occur in the document of interest, thus the shape, as well as node colouring,
will differ across documents. Depth in the hyponymy tree
determines on which concentric ring a node appears. The
width of each annulus is maximized to allow for all visible
graph elements to fit within the display space.
Node Colour
It is possible to look at multiple senses of a word in one view.
Views rooted at a single word contain a uniquely coloured
subtree for each synset (sense) containing that word. In contrast, trees rooted at a single synset use a single hue. Since
luminance variation in the green region of the spectrum
is the most readily perceived, it is the first colour choice
[Sto03, 30]. Gray is used for nodes with zero occurrence
counts, since their presence provides a visual reminder of
what words are not used.
Transparency is used to visualize relative word or synset

count. Similar to the concept of value, transparency provides a range of light to dark colour gradations, thus offering ordered [Ber83] and pre-attentive [War04] visuals.
Highly opaque nodes have many occurrences; almost transparent nodes have few occurrences. Word senses that are
more prominent in the document stand out against the more
transparent context.
Two ways to visualize word occurrence are provided:
single-node and cumulative. In the single-node visualization,
only synset nodes whose word members occur in the document are coloured. In the cumulative view, counts are propagated up to the root of the tree. In both views, transparency is
normalized so maximum counts achieve full opacity. When
multiple documents are visualized, the cross-document maximum is used to set the scale. These modes support a gradual refinement of focus. The cumulative, or subtree, view
uses the association of words into synsets and synsets into
a hyponymy tree to aggregate counts for related concepts.
Similar to the TreeJuxtaposer techniques for visualizing differences embedded deep in a large tree [MGT∗ 03], by highlighting the entire subtree containing the node, salient small
nodes can be more easily located, even if hidden from view
by a filter. The single-node view reveals precise concepts in
the document and supports the selection of synsets whose
word members appear in the document being analyzed. In
addition, for a fully expanded graph, the single node view
may highlight nodes that are otherwise too small to notice.
The subtree and cumulative views are compared in Figure 3.
While transparency is an effective visual method for distinguishing large differences and trends, it is impossible to
read exact data values using it. To facilitate the exact reading of synset occurrence counts for the selected text tiles, we
provide a dynamic legend (see Figure 4).

Figure 5: DocuBurst of a general science textbook rooted
at {energy}. At right, mouse wheel interaction was used to
shrink the angular width of the subtree rooted at {radiation}
and expand the subtree under {electricity} exposing the previously illegible node {signal}.

Second, we implement a generalized fisheye view [Fur86]
that collapses all subtrees which are more than a userspecified distance from the central root node. Changing this
distance-based filter allows for a semantic zoom, creating visual summaries of varying specificity. The presence of nonzero word occurrence counts within collapsed subtrees is indicated by using the cumulative colouring, in which counts
are propagated to the root. Optionally, all highlight nodes
can be exempted from the distance filter (by increasing their
a priori importance in the DOI function), effectively abstracting the graph to all synsets within a given distance from
the root or highlight nodes (see Figure 1).

A root node can be a word, in which case its immediate children are the synsets containing that word. Alternatively the
visualization can be rooted at a synset. Root nodes in the visualization are selectable by searching for either a word or
synset of interest. Once a root is chosen, the visualization is
populated with all its hyponyms.

Double clicking on a node of interest restricts the visualization to the hyponyms of the node’s synset; double rightclicking reverses this action by reloading the graph at the
parent of the clicked node, thus providing bi-directional data
navigation through the hyponymy relation. To create more
space for the details of the children of a given synset, the
angular width of a node and its subtree can be manually increased using the mouse wheel. This increase provides a radial detail-in-context view which causes the node’s siblings
to be correspondingly compressed. Changes to a node’s angular width affect its children equally and its siblings in an
inverse manner (see Figure 5).

As there are more than 70, 000 English noun synsets in
WordNet, techniques to abstract and filter the data are important. First, we provide a highlight search function which
visually highlights nodes whose label matches any of the
given search terms. Highlight nodes have a gold background
and border, and a darker font colour, drawing attention to
even the smallest of search results. The transparency of the
highlight (gold) background is attenuated to the word occurrence counts so as to not disrupt this data-carrying value and
to provide for stronger pop-out of search results with high
occurrence counts.

The visualization can be based on selected subsections
of the document. The initial view is based on all text tiles
in the document, but a selection can limit the tiles from
which counts are drawn. Unrestricted visual pan and geometric zoom of the display space are also supported, as well
as a zoom-to-fit control to reset the pan and zoom to a best-fit
for the currently visible tree. Rendering is dependent on the
zoom factor: node borders are not rendered when the nodes
are very small, and labels are not rendered when they would
not be legible. All highlighting, navigation, and emphasis interactions are provided in real time.

is revealed in the tile browser. Selecting a tile reveals the text with occurrences of the selected synset highlighted.

6. Drill Down
The full text can be read through accessing the text tiles at
the bottom of the interface. To navigate the text, we use a
linked visualization: the text tile browser. Rectangles representing the text tiles appears in a linear, vertical array to the
right of the DocuBurst. A fisheye distortion [Bed00] facilitates navigation and selection of text tiles within this list.
Clicking any tile brings it into view. Furthermore, this visualization can be used to see occurrence patterns in the
document. By clicking nodes in the DocuBurst visualization, synsets and entire subtrees can be selected. Text tiles in
which selected synsets appear show as varying intensity of
orange in the text tile browser, depending on number of occurrences in the tile. Occurrences of those synsets and words
are also highlighted in the full text window.
Concordance lines are a standard linguistic analysis tool

in which all occurrences of a word of interest are extracted
and displayed with their left and right N (usually 5) context
words. Concordance lines for selections are extracted and
shown in the concordance window. Patterns of orange in the
tile browser can indicate how localized concepts are in the
document. For example, in Figure 6, we see that {electricity}
appears more frequently toward the end of the document. We
can use the tile browser and full text window to quickly find
occurrences of the terms of interest in context. By clicking
the text tile rectangles in the tile browser, we find, in the tile
detail window, that there is a chapter on ‘electricity’ at the
end of the book.

problem. Additionally the use of uneven tree cut models to
abstract the DocuBurst in a dynamic way may clarify the
view. For example, if the subtree under a node has only one
leaf with a non-zero count, we may omit that subtree.

ent texts will reveal relative frequency differences between
them. While the other examples in this paper were visualization of a high school general science text book, we also can
apply the technique to other forms of electronic text. In Figure 7 we applied DocuBurst to the transcripts of two 2008
US presidential debates. Note that to ensure comparability
when viewing multiple documents, colour scaling is based
on the maximum count for visible nodes across all documents.
A high level view of the debates rooted at {person} revealed strong colour for the {leader} and {serviceman, military personnel, military man} subtrees. Drill down revealed
{senator} is a descendant of {leader} (both participants
were senators). Attention to military issues and veterans is
also expected given current conflicts. Examining the third
debate showed an additional region of colour under the
{craftsman} subtree. Further investigation, by switching to
the occurrence count size function, revealed a dramatic shift
in concentration within the {skilled worker} subtree. Military people became relatively less important compared to
craftspeople — specifically, plumbers. This is the effect of
Senator McCain’s focus on “Joe the Plumber” in the third
debate, and was the genesis point of this phrase which dominated the remainder of the campaign.
8. Challenges and Future Work
Reflecting on this work has suggested several interesting opportunities for future research in both the data and visualization realms. From a data perspective, the original goal of
viewing what parts of an entire language are included in a
document merits further research. As with all text visualizations, it is necessary to view a subset of language due to
limited display space and computational resources with extremely large data. Views rooted at {entity} and covering all
English nouns appear cluttered and interaction is slow. It is
commonly held that WordNet sense-divisions are too finegrained for many computational applications; investigation
into other ways to abstract WordNet may help alleviate this
c 2009 The Author(s)
Journal compilation c 2009 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Finding a place to begin exploration is a challenge
with the current implementation. Providing hints for which
synsets may be of interest as visualization roots for a particular document or set of documents may assist an analyst to
find views of interest. Methods which may be useful include
suggesting synsets with a high fraction of non-zero leaves
below them, or when the cumulative count divided by the
number of leaves is high, indicating an area of unusual concentration.
Word sense disambiguation is an area of active research
in computational linguistics that could benefit DocuBurst.
Currently, an occurrence of a word is divided among all
synsets in which it appears. Thus ‘river bank’ will augment
the count for {bank, savings bank, depository financial institution}. Incorporating word sense disambiguation into the
preprocessing step would greatly enhance the value of the
visualization. For example, in the general science textbook
used for the examples in this paper, ‘man’ occurs quite often
in the sense of ‘people’ (“man invented the wheel”). However, these occurrences are also counted towards the biological {hominid} sense of ‘man’, resulting in the incorrectly
strong appearance of the {primate} subtree. Additionally,
we currently use word occurrence count as the only available word scoring function. Other scoring functions, such as
the Dunning Log-likelihood ratio [Dun93], could be used to
highlight important or unusual words in a document. Other
text features, such as hapax legomena (words which occur
only once) could be used with the WordNet-based layout to
provide special-purpose summaries of content.
Visually, the use of transparency to indicate word occurrence is useful for the intuitive mapping between data and visual appearance. However, it also introduces the possibility
of misleading illusions. For instance, siblings in DocuBurst
are unordered; furthermore, non-sibling nodes may be adjacent. By chance, unrelated nodes that both have high occurrence counts can appear as a large swath of strong colour.
Gestalt perception may lead viewers to impart significance
to this coincidence. Stronger node borders would distinguish
these regions, but node borders become obstructive on small
nodes. Finding an experimentally validated solution to this
design trade-off could impact space-filling visualizations in
general.
9. Conclusion
DocuBurst provides an overview visualization of document
content which is based on a human-centered view of language whereas previous works were based on far simpler,
derivative statistical analyses. The visual design is grounded
in established research on human abilities in colour perception. Semantic and geometric zooming, filtering, search, and

1046

details-on-demand provide a visual document summary, revealing what subset of language is covered by a document,
and how those terms are distributed.

Initially motivated by the current lack of a digital equivalent of flipping through a book, this work leads well into an
investigation of the DocuBurst technique to view the differences between two or more documents, which may be useful
for plagiarism detection, document categorization, and authorship attribution. Existing digital library interfaces could
be enhanced with arrays of DocuBurst icons, allowing comparison against one another or a baseline reference corpus to
portray content in more pleasing and information-rich ways.
