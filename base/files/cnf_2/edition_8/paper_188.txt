Abstract
In this paper a biorthogonal wavelet approach based on Doo-Sabin subdivision is presented. In the dual subdivision like Doo-Sabin scheme, all the old control vertices disappear after one subdivision step, which is a big
challenge to the biorthogonal wavelet construction. In our approach, the barycenters of the V -faces corresponding
to the old vertices are selected as the vertices associated with the scaling functions to construct the scaling space.
The lifting scheme is used to guarantee the fitting quality of the wavelet transform, and a local orthogonalization is
introduced with a discrete inner product operation to improve the computation efficiency. Sharp feature modeling
based on extended Doo-Sabin subdivision rules is also discussed in the framework of our wavelet construction.
The presented wavelet construction is proven to be stable and effective by the experimental results.
Categories and Subject Descriptors (according to ACM CCS): I.3.5 [Computational Geometry and Object Modeling]: Curve, surface, solid, and object representations; Hierarchy and geometric transformations;

1. Introduction
Highly-detailed complex 3D models in animation and engineering applications and high-resolution 3D scanning techniques demand efficient representations of massive polygonal meshes. In recent decades, wavelet constructions based
on different subdivision rules, along with the lifting scheme
[SS95, Swe96, Swe97], have attracted many researchers’ attention. The subdivision-based wavelets provide a promising tool to address challenges of multi-resolution geometric modeling of massive data sets. Wavelets are a kind of
widely used multi-resolution analysis techniques, and have
the inherent relations with subdivision schemes which produce finer and finer meshes from the coarse arbitrary meshes
recursively. The subdivision-based wavelets take advantage
of the capability of wavelets to represent signal details in
multi-resolution levels to break a new way for modeling 3D
models with abundant geometric details.
In this paper, we present a wavelet construction based on
Doo-Sabin subdivision [DS78] - an very popular dual subdivision. Compared with the previous work [SMAB02], our
approach uses additional vertices, whose locations correspond to the old ones in the mesh before each step of subdivision, to get the reversible subdivision rules rather than the
average reversing method. Because our wavelet construction

is based on the subdivision rules, the sharp feature modeling
can be included in the framework of the wavelet transform
by the extended subdivision rules, while the method presented in [SMAB02] can not be extended easily to address
this problem. Moreover, our method has better fitting quality
than Samavati’s method proven by experiment results.

1.1. Primal subdivision and Dual Subdivision
The subdivision schemes can be classified as primal and
dual ones according to the different topological rules.
Many primal-subdivision-based
wavelets over both trian√
gle (e.g. Loop [Ber04], 3 [WQS07])
and quadrilateral
√
(e.g. Catmull-Clark [WQT06], 2 [WTQ07]) meshes are
proposed and used in animation and engineering applications, while wavelet constructions, especially biorthogonal
wavelets, based on dual subdivision schemes like Doo-Sabin
subdivision have not been well studied yet.
The subdivision rules of each primal scheme like CatmullClark subdivision [CC78] can be divided into two parts distinctly: the computation rules of new inserted vertices and
the refinement rules of old control points. But in dual subdivision schemes like Doo-Sabin subdivision, all the old
control points disappeare after one subdivision step and the

refined control meshes are constructed only by the new
inserted vertices. Figure 1 shows the different topological refinement rules between primal and dual subdivision
schemes.

Figure 2 illustrates the mask of Doo-Sabin subdivision.
For an n-sided face, with the notions shown in Figure 2, the
geometric rules for computing new inserted vertices can be

In biothogonal wavelet constructions based on primal
subdivisions, the lazy wavelet synthesis can be defined by
adding additional vectors to the subdivisions. In the wavelet
transform, the lazy wavelets correspond to the added vectors,
while the scaling functions correspond to the re-located old
vertices (the solid points in the left of Figure 1). For DooSabin subdivision, there is no any re-located vertex in the refined meshes, so it is impossible to construct the lazy wavelet
synthesis, like primal-subdivision-based wavelets, directly
using the original subdivision rules. In this paper, we select
the barycenters of the V -faces in the refined meshes as the relocated results of the old control points, and then the scaling
functions can be established so that the wavelet transform
based on Doo-Sabin subdivision can be constructed.
1.2. Doo-Sabin Subdivision
Doo-Sabin subdivision is a typical dual quadrilateral scheme
which is an extension of the bi-quadratic uniform B-spline
surfaces to surfaces of arbitrary topology. Through a limiting process of subdivision operations, it produces uniform
bi-quadratic B-spline surfaces for regular rectangular control meshes and global C1-continuous surfaces for arbitrary
control meshes, respectively. The vertex split is the most
notable characteristic of the topological refinement rules of
Doo-Sabin subdivision. In a subdivision step, each vertex of
valence n is split into n new vertices in n incident faces, and
the refined mesh is built with three kinds of new faces: Ffaces, E-faces and V -faces, corresponding to the old faces,
edges and vertices. The valences of each E-face and each
vertex after one subdivision are equal to 4, while all F-faces
and V -faces have the same valences as the corresponding old
faces and vertices.

1.3. Related Work
Doo-Sabin subdivision [DS78] is an approximation scheme
for arbitrary-topology meshes, and is considered as a generalization of the tensor product version of Chaikin’s subdivision [Cha74]. The detailed derivation process of Doo-Sabin
subdivsion can be found in [Ma05]. Doo-Sabin subdivision
has the ability for modeling sharp features by extending the
subdivision rules [WSS98, Nas87].
The subdivision wavelet is first introduced by Lounsbery [Lou94] and Lounsbery et al. [LDW97]. In [LDW97],
a new class of subdivision-based wavelets and some potential applications are presented. Reversing subdivision rules
is an important ingredient of subdivision wavelet constructions. Samavati, Mahdavi-Amiri and Bartels studied reversing subdivision rules by straightforward matrix observations [SMAB99] and developed the Doo-subdivision-based
wavelet construction by locally reversing the Doo subdivision scheme [SMAB02]. Bartels and Samavati disscussed
the problem of reversing subdivision rules in the biorthogonal systems [BS00]. Utilizing the decorrelation ability of the
wavelets, Khodakovsky, Schröder and Sweldens explored
applications of Loop subdivision wavelets to data compression. To break through the restriction of subdivision connectivity in common subdivision wavelet constructions, Eck
et al. extended the Lounsbery’s work from semi-regular
meshes to arbitrary meshes using the mesh approximation
method [EDD∗ 95]. Bonneau introduced “waveletlike” decomposition and reconstruction algorithms on piecewise

constant data sets over irregular triangular surface meshes
[Bon98]. To keep the connectivity and geometry of the processed mesh completely unchanged, Valette and Prost presented the wavelet constructions based on an irregular subdivision scheme [VP04a], and developed the wavelet-based
progressive compression scheme for irregular 3D meshes
[VP04b].
The lifting scheme, which facilitates the development
of the subdivision wavelets, is a representative approach
for the construction of the second generation wavelets
[Swe96, Swe97]. The customizing property of the lifting
scheme allows the wavelet construction to be applied to
arbitrary domains [SS95]. Based on the lifting operations,
the subdivision-based wavelet constructions are very effective and efficient. Using the elaborated lifting operations, Bertram et al. presented a series of subdivision-based
wavelet constructions based on Loop [Ber04] and generalized B-spline subdivision [BDHJ04, BDH00]. For some
widely used subdivision schemes, Wang, Qin and Tang
presented an effective wavelet construction for the general
Catmull-Clark subdivision [WQT06], while Wang, Qin and
Sun
√ the biorthogonal wavelet analysis based on the
√ proposed
3 and 2 subdivisions [WQS07, WTQ07]. Profiting from
the idea of the lifting scheme, Li, Qin and Sun proposed an
unlifted Loop subdivision wavelet construction [LQS04].

To overcome this obstacle, the scaling functions should be
established in the wavelet construction, so the corresponding
re-located vertices of the old control points should be picked
up in the refined mesh. In Doo-Sabin subdivision, for an old
vertex v, all the new inserted vertices around it form a new
V -face, and the barycenter v of the new V -face is an appropriate corresponding vertex of v (see Figure 3). The barycenter of a V -face does not need to be stored in advance, but can

be easily computed in the wavelet analysis process. Another
reason of this selection is that a reversible formula can be
constructed with an old vertex v and its corresponding relocated vertex v .
k

With the notions illustrated in Figure 3, taking the f i j to
denote the new inserted vertex which is produced by the old
k
vertex vi in the face k j and the fi j to denote the corresponding wavelet coefficient, the lazy wavelet synthesis based on
Doo-Sabin subdivision can be defined as follows:

2. Doo-Sabin Subdivision Wavelets
In biothogonal subdivision wavelet constructions, the first
step is to build the lazy wavelet transform that is the cornerstone of the lifting wavelet. It needs a series of reversible
local operations derived from the subdivision rules. To convert the original subdivision schemes to the reversible lazy
wavelet synthesis rules, introducing some additional vectors corresponding to the wavelet coefficients is a common
method. As we have mentioned in Section 1, in the previous
biothogonal wavelet constructions based on primal
√ subdivision schemes (e.g., Loop, Catmull-Clark and 3 subdivision etc.), the scaling functions correspond to the re-located
old vertices. With the added vectors corresponding to the
wavelet coefficients, which are supposed to be zero initially,
the primal subdivision rules can be naturally converted to the
lazy-wavelet synthesis process. But in the case of Doo-Sabin
subdivision, unfortunately, all the old vertices disappear after one subdivision step, and the scaling space can not be established with the common method used in previous wavelet
constructions based on the primal subdivision.

The above synthesis and analysis processes constitute a lazy

the wavelet coefficients fi j are equal to 0, the synthesis process is just the Doo-Sabin subdivision scheme. The shortcoming of the lazy wavelet is the poor fitting quality. To address this problem, the lifting scheme is taken into account.
Generally speaking, the lifting operations applied to the lazy
wavelets have the following format:
vi = v i + L i F i ,

coefficients, and F i is an n × 3 matrix containing n wavelet
coefficients corresponding to n new vertices adjacent to the
control point vi .
To calculate the lifting coefficients, it is necessary to make
the lazy wavelets orthogonal with the scaling functions. For
saving the computation cost, a local orthogonalization which
is widely used in many primal-subdivision-based wavelets
[Ber04, WQT06, WQS07, WTQ07] is introduced in our approach. There are n old vertices contributing to a new inserted vertex in a face with valence n, so a lazy wavelet associated with the new inserted vertex is orthogonalized with
the n scaling functions associated with the n re-located vertices(see Figure 4).

The above equation should satisfy the following orthogonalization conditions:
ψ, φi = 0, (i = 0, 1, 2, ...n − 1); ψ, ψ = 1.
Substituting Equation 2 into the above orthogonalization
conditions, a linear system about the lifting coefficients ωi
and λ can be obtained. It is obvious that solving this linear
system will involve many computations of the inner products. A discrete inner product operation which simplifies
the computational complexity is employed and proved to be
similar effect of the fitting quality to the continuous version
by many experimental results. After at most two subdivision steps, there is at most one irregular incident face(the
valence is not equal to 4) connected to each vertex, and the

The orthogonalizing coefficients ωi and λ for a wavelet f
associated with a new inserted vertex in Equation 2 only depend on the valence of the face where the new vertex is produced and for most cases they can be pre-computed in order
to increase the efficiency of the implementation. Table 1 lists
some pre-computed coefficients for the wavelets.
With these orthogonalizing coefficients, the lifting operations similar to Equation 1 can be constructed and the whole

where a vector fi is introduced as the lazy wavelet for each
new vertex fi and is initially set to 0. Here we only consider
the wavelet construction of the vertices on the sharp edges.
One important ingredient of our wavelet construction based
on Doo-Sabin subdivision is to identify the corresponding
vertex of each old control point. For an old vertex on the
sharp edge (v in Figure 7(a)) which is not a corner vertex,
the average of the two new vertices on the incident sharp
edges(v an v ) is picked up as the corresponding one in the
refined mesh, while for a corner vertex(v in Figure 7(b)),
because it is unchanged during the subdivision process, so
the corresponding vertex in the refined mesh is itself.

3. Sharp Feature Modeling
To obtain the ability of modeling sharp features, such as
boundaries, creases and corners, the subdivision rules should
be extended. For simplicity, Doo-Sabin subdivision rules for
sharp features in the quadrilateral faces(shown in Figure 7)
and the corresponding wavelet construction are discussed
here. The detailed schemes of sharp-feature modeling with
Doo-Sabin subdivision can be found in [Nas87, Nas97].
With the notations illustrated in Figure 7, the lazy wavelet
synthesis rules based on Doo-Sabin subdivision for sharpfeature modeling can be expressed as

The lifting scheme based on the local orthogonalization is
also applied to the lazy wavelets associated with the vertices
on the sharp edges. Because only the two old vertices on the
endpoint of a sharp edge contribute to a new inserted vertex
v on the sharp edge, the lazy wavelet ψl can be lifted as
follows:
ψ = λψl + ω0 φ0 + ω1 φ1 ,
satisfying
ψ, φi = 0, i = 0, 1, ψ, ψ = 1.
A linear system about the lifting coefficients can be obtained
from the above equations. The discrete inner product operation is also employed here. The discrete forms of the lazy
wavelets ψl and scaling functions φi in one feature face are
shown in Figure 8. The orthogonalizing coefficients for the

Figure 9: The base mesh (left), the
model(middle), and the disturbed model(right)

subdivided

Noise-filtering experiments are usually used to test the
stability of the subdivision wavelets. The base mesh used
for testing the performance of the proposed Doo-Sabin subdivision wavelets is shown in Figure 9. Similar to the noisefiltering experiments employed in [Ber04,WQT06,WQS07],
the base mesh is subdivided 5 times using Doo-Sabin subdivision and then the white noise is added to all the vertices of the final mesh which is regarded as the model at
the highest resolution level. Subsequently, a low-pass filtering operation is applied to the disturbed model: decompose

the model step by step from the resolution level 5 to level
0 using the proposed wavelet analysis algorithm; then subdivide the mesh at each level to the level 5. The resulting
meshes of the low-pass filtering are shown in Figure 10.
In the visual impression, the model’s shape at the level 0
is very close to the initial model without any white noise,
and the numerical statistical results of the L2 errors of all
the low-pass filtered models are listed in Table 2. For comparison, we employ the same noise-filtering experiment as
Samavati’s method [SMAB02], and also list the L2 errors. It
is shown that our Doo-Sabin subdivision wavelet construction has the outstanding capability of noise reduction which
is better than Samavati’s and is sufficiently stable.

Progressive transmission is an important application of
subdivision wavelets. To transmit a highly-detailed 3D
model, its coarsest mesh can be transmitted at first, and
the wavelet coefficients at each level are transmitted subsequently. The receptor at the other end can reconstruct the
gradually finer model until the model has adequate details
for the application. In progressive transmission, the wavelet
analysis is very important. Figure 11 shows two examples of
the proposed Doo-Sabin subdivision wavelet analysis. The
two example models both have arbitrary base meshes. It is
shown that the wavelet analysis process of our wavelet construction is stable for the high-detailed models of arbitrary
base topology. In the wavelet synthesis process, the number
of faces of the model “horse” increase from 119 to 119810,
and the synthesis time increase from 0.003 to 0.368 seconds
on a PC equipped with 2.67 GHz AMD CPU and 2GB RAM.
The computation time is linearly proportional to the number
of the model faces, and it is shown that our wavelet transform is very efficient.
Based on the special subdivision rules and the corresponding wavelet construction, the presented Doo-Sabin subdivision wavelets can model the complicated multi-resolution
models with sharp features. Figure 12 shows an example of
the sharp feature modeling. The model at the highest resolution level(left one of Figure 12) has sharp edges(painted in
blue color) and surface details. Similar to the noise-filtering
experiment, the low-pass filtering operation is employed.
From the models at the resolution levels 3 and 0 generated
by the presented sharp-feature-preserving wavelet analysis,

we can find that the model at each level of resolution is able
to keep the shape including sharp features very well, while
the surface details gradually disappear, so our subdivision
wavelet construction for sharp-feature modeling is effective.

5. Conclusions
We present a biorthogonal wavelet construction based on
an important dual subdivision - Doo-Sabin subdivision and
the lifting scheme. As well known, the topological refinement rules are very different between the dual subdivision
schemes like Doo-Sabin subdivision and the primal ones.
In Doo-Sabin subdivision, all the old control points disappear after the subdivision process, in other words, there is
no any obvious vertex in the refined mesh corresponding
to the old vertices after any subdivision step, thus this becomes a big challenge in the biorthogonal wavelet construction. To addresses this challenge, for each old control point,

the barycenter of the V -face produced by the old one is selected as the corresponding vertex in the refined mesh, and
a vertex refinement rule is added to the original subdivision
rules. With the extended subdivision rules, the corresponding lazy wavelet transform can be constructed and translated
into a sequence of simple local operations easily. To improve
the fitting quality of the lazy wavelet transform, the lifting scheme is constructed; the lazy wavelet corresponding
to the new inserted vertices is orthogonalized with the correlative local scaling functions, and the discrete inner product is introduced for reducing the computational complexity. With the lifting operations, our Doo-Sabin-subdivisionbased wavelet construction is very effective and stable.
Compared with the previous work for the Doosubdivision wavelet construction [SMAB02] in which an average reversing method was presented, our wavelet construction based on Doo-Sabin subdivision can not only represent
the common highly-detailed models but also model the sharp
features of surfaces and has better fitting quality than Samavati’s method. The presented Doo-Sabin-subdivision-based
wavelet construction can be used for many applications like
progressive transmission, shape approximation, data compression and so on. The basic idea for constructing biorthogonal wavelets based on dual subdivision of our approach is
flexible, and can be generalized to other dual subdivision
wavelets constructions.
