Abstract
Graph visualization systems often exploit opaque metanodes to reduce visual clutter and improve the readability
of large graphs. This filtering can be done in a path-preserving way based on attribute values associated with the
nodes of the graph. Despite extensive use of these representations, as far as we know, no formal experimentation
exists to evaluate if they improve the readability of graphs.
In this paper, we present the results of a user study that formally evaluates how such representations affect the
readability of graphs. We also explore the effect of graph size and connectivity in terms of this primary research
question. Overall, for our tasks, we did not find a significant difference when this clustering is used. However, if
the graph is highly connected, these clusterings can improve performance. Also, if the graph is large enough and
can be simplified into a few metanodes, benefits in performance on global tasks are realized. Under these same
conditions, however, performance of local attribute tasks may be reduced.

volve both attributes and graph topology. Outlying paths to
external machines can indicate security leaks in a network.
Understanding the connectivity between servers before and
during an attack on Internet infrastructure can help a variety
of investigators. Also, the central core of ISPs near the centre
of a large network is important for administrators.

1. Introduction
Many visualization systems have exploited metanodes to
improve the readability of graphs. Each metanode places
a subset of the nodes and edges inside an opaque node,
hiding these details. Edges connecting two metanodes are
metaedges. Metanodes can be constructed in a pathpreserving [AMA08] manner which ensures that if a path
is visible in the metanode representation, it actually exists in
the underlying graph. In this paper, a path-preserving clustering (PPC) is a flat clustering with opaque metanodes that
hide graph details but reflect underlying graph connectivity.

Graph visualization systems often recursively place subgraphs into metanodes, forming a cluster tree or graph hierarchy. Some of this work exploits a pre-existing drawing [EF96, SZG∗ 96, GKN05, vHvW04] while others draw
the graph as the user explores the data [EH00, AvHK06,
DGDGL07, AMA08]. Many of these systems use attributes [PVP01, Wat06, AMA08]. In our experiment, a PPC
corresponds to a two-level, path-preserving graph hierarchy
where node attribute values define metanodes. Thus, our experiment, in part, validates many of these representations.

Often, attributes are associated with the nodes or edges of
the graph and are used to construct metanodes. In this experiment, attributes are extrinsic information associated with
the nodes of the graph that has no explicit relationship to
the graph structure. As an example, in a computer network,
servers can have a name attribute, but this name does not
necessarily have a relationship to network topology.

In this paper, we present a formal user study with the primary research question:

Questions where such clusterings may help are common.

In addition, we ask the secondary research questions:
• How does the size of the graph affect these results?
• How does graph connectivity affect these results?
Overall, we did not find a significant difference when
PPCs constructed using node attributes were used. However,
if the graph is highly connected, PPCs can improve performance. Also, if the graph is large enough and can be simplified into a few metanodes, benefits in performance on global
tasks are realized. Under these same conditions, however,
local attribute tasks may have reduced performance.
2. Related Work
In this work, we test PPCs constructed using node attribute
values. As such, we divide related work into two sections.
Section 2.1 presents related areas of graph hierarchy visualization. Section 2.2 presents experiments that have examined
graph readability.
2.1. Graph Hierarchy Visualization
A number of techniques have been proposed to visualize a
graph and a superimposed hierarchy. These methods group
subgraphs recursively into metanodes, forming a hierarchy
of coarse graphs. Such techniques can be used to visualize a
graph where the nodes have attribute values if nodes of the
same value are placed inside the same metanode.

experiment, the author showed that minimizing bends, minimizing edge crossings, and maximizing symmetry may affect user performance. The experiment provided evidence
that the number of edges that cross the shortest path in a
graph drawing or the continuity of a path may also affect the
readability of a graph drawing.
A more recent series of experiments examined other factors influencing graph readability [HEH08]. A first experiment found that users tended to prefer well separated clusters to delineate groups of nodes and that central nodes were
more important to the group than exterior ones [HHE06].
Secondly, users tended to follow links that lead, in an Euclidean sense, from a source node towards a target node
when following a path [HEH09]. The work of van Ham and
Rogowitz [vHR08] suggested clusters sometimes were clarified by placing a few nodes of the cluster on the boundary
of a convex polygon. Although all of these works studied
the influence of aesthetic criteria on graph readability, none
of them examined their effect in a PPC context, as we do in
this experiment. However, these results should be considered
when drawing all levels of the graph hierarchy.
Schaffer et al. [SZG∗ 96] studied the readability of a hierarchically clustered graph using either a fisheye or zoom
method for revealing details in clusters. The authors found
that the fisheye method was significantly faster and required
significantly less interaction. However, they did not find a
significant difference in terms of the number of errors made
by the participants. Although the experiment did use a graph
hierarchy, it was focused on determining if the fisheye technique influenced performance.

A number of techniques have been proposed including: extruding the graph hierarchy into the third dimension [EF96], multi-focal fisheye views where metanodes
are expanded and viewed in the context of the entire
graph [SZG∗ 96], topological fisheye views where abstract
versions of the graph are presented at increasing distances
from the focus centre [GKN05], and interactively visualizing hierarchies of small world clusterings [vHvW04]. These
systems typically draw the entire graph beforehand and exploit this layout to construct a suitable hierarchy. Steerable techniques draw portions of the graph hierarchy on
demand as the user explores the graph, and a number of
these approaches have also been suggested in the literature [EH00, AvHK06, DGDGL07, AMA08].

Wattenberg [Wat06] examined roll-up and selection operations on graphs with node attributes. In his technique, the
graph is divided into groups of nodes based on attribute values. Each group is aggregated into a single metanode and
the metanodes are laid out in a grid based on attribute value.
Through several pilot studies, the author found evidence that
the tool could help users spot patterns in attributed graphs.
It should be noted however that the pilots were informal and
that the technique is not path-preserving.

In this experiment, we tested interfaces (like many of
the above systems) that render the graph hierarchies using
opaque metanodes. However, we only test two-level hierarchies and only allow the participant to click on a metanode
to reveal its details. This interaction is the most basic and
generally supported in nearly all of the above described systems.

To test whether depicting PPCs constructed using node attribute data help in reading graphs, we performed a within
subjects experiment. We performed a 2 condition (PathPreserving Clustering (PPC) vs. No Clustering (NC)) × 6
data set × 4 question design. In order to create the six data
sets, two large graphs were chosen, one with low connectivity and the other with high connectivity. Small, medium, and
large subsets of this data were taken.

2.2. Graphs Readability Experiments
Purchase [Pur97] examined how different graph drawing
aesthetic criteria affected the readability of graphs. In this

duration of the task. As seen in Figure 1, four radio buttons

appear on the right of the interface. The participants selected
a radio button to indicate their answer and confirmed their response by clicking on the button at the bottom of the screen.
All experiments were conducted in the same quiet, windowless room and on the same machine. They were conducted individually, with only the participant and the experimenter present. A thirty inch Apple Cinema display was
used so that graph elements would be maximally visible.
3.1. Interfaces
Interaction was controlled as much as possible in the experiment across conditions. Under both the PPC and NC conditions, the participant could pan the display by holding down
the left mouse button and dragging. Likewise, the participant
could zoom by scrolling the mouse wheel.

To open metanodes during the PPC condition, the participant clicked on the metanode with the right mouse button. The details of the metanode were shown on a circular,
coloured background. When participants clicked with the
right mouse button on this background, the metanode would
close. Figure 2 shows a metanode before and after it has been
opened. When a metanode is closed, it is opaque and hides
all details it contains, which is consistent with many existing systems [SZG∗ 96, EH00, vHvW04, GKN05, AvHK06,
AMA08]. No other form of interaction was permitted.
Focus nodes, in both conditions, were large, black
hexagons or pentagons. They were used to indicate the node
or the pair of nodes relevant to the question. In the PPC
condition, if either of the focus nodes were present inside a
metanode, the outline of the metanode was highlighted with
a thick black line. This encoding eliminated any additional

cognitive cost of searching for nodes or reading labels. To
help the participant find the focus nodes quickly, focus nodes
were made significantly larger than other nodes in the graph.
Colours encoded attribute values under both conditions of
the experiment. Four colours were used: red, blue, purple,
and gold. This colouring scheme was used for both nodes
and metanodes and participants were notified that metanodes
contained only nodes of that colour.
3.2. Data Sets
Two data sets were used in this experiment: Internet
and IMDB. We took subsets of this data to make graphs
of three sizes with consistent connectivity properties. Only
three sizes of data were chosen so that we could explore
the effect of graph size, but still have the experiment last a
reasonable amount of time. The participants were not made
aware of what Internet and IMDB actually represented.
While it would be interesting to investigate the readability
of graphs within the context of real-world domains, our research questions were not domain-specific. Thus, there was
no need for the domain to play a role. We simply chose two
data sets each of realistic size and structure.
For the NC condition, the graph without metanodes was
drawn with a force-directed algorithm [FLM95] that took
node size into account. For the PPC condition, the contents of each metanode were drawn independently and then
the metanode level above was drawn with the same forcedirected algorithm. These layouts were controlled for all versions of the questions in the experiment.
3.2.1. Internet
Internet is a scan of the major servers on the Internet backbone performed in 2005 by the Internet mapping
project [CBB00]. Nodes are servers and an edge exists if
two servers exchanged packets.
In order to generate our graphs, we chose three subsets
of Internet. Starting from the set of servers whose name
contains the string Bordeaux, we added all nodes and edges
distance four, six, and eight from these servers in a graph theoretic sense. We denote these data sets: Internet small

consisting of 215 nodes 281 edges, Internet medium
consisting of 745 nodes and 955 edges, and Internet
large consisting of 3,351 nodes 4,083 edges. The number of
edges in this data set is relatively low compared to the number of nodes with the ratio of edges to nodes ranging from
1.21 to 1.31. Thus, we term these data sets “low connectivity” data.
A two-level graph hierarchy was constructed on top of this
data set. The first level replaces connected components of
the same attribute by metanodes while the second level is
the contents of the metanodes. In both conditions, nodes are
coloured according to attribute. The nodes in red correspond
to servers with a *.fr name. Next, nodes in blue correspond to
servers with a *.net domain name. Nodes in gold have only
an IP address recorded. All remaining nodes are coloured
purple. Figure 3(a) and 3(b) show the small and large version
of this data under the NC and PPC conditions.
3.2.2. IMDB
IMDB is the largest connected component of the InfoVis
2007 contest data set [KJKC07]. Nodes are movies, and
edges exist between movies if they share an actor.
In order to generate our graphs, we chose three subsets
of IMDB. First, we randomly removed edges from this data
set to reduce its connectivity, improving the overall readability of the data set. Then, from this filtered data set, we
selected nodes at distance one or two from movies that won
at least three Oscars. IMDB small consists of 78 nodes and
145 edges of movies that are one hop away computed with
70% of the edges randomly removed. IMDB medium consists of 356 nodes and 601 edges of movies at distance one
or two computed with 80% of the edges randomly removed
and 50% of the nodes. IMDB large consists of 434 nodes and
802 edges of movies at distance one or two computed with
80% of the edges randomly removed and 40% of the nodes.
The number of edges in this data set is relatively high when
compared to the number of nodes with the ratio of edges to
nodes ranging from 1.68 to 1.86. Thus, we term this data
“high connectivity” data.
As in Internet, a two-level graph hierarchy was constructed on top of this data set. In both conditions, nodes are
coloured according to attribute. The nodes in red correspond
to movies that have a comedy genre. Next, nodes in blue correspond to movies with a drama genre name. Nodes in gold
have a thriller genre. The remaining nodes are coloured purple. Figure 3(c) and 3(d) show the small and large version of
this data under the PPC and NC conditions.

3.3. Tasks
To answer our research questions, we should require the
participant to read both global and local structure in a
graph with attributes. We would also like to test tasks that

are both focused on attributes and underlying graph topology. Four question types (local/attribute, global/attribute,
global/topology, local/topology) are therefore needed to investigate our research questions on graphs with both relational structure and node attribute values. Keywords were
presented in bold, so that the participant could easily recognize each question. For each of the six data sets, four
versions of each question were created with different focus
nodes. The four questions were posed in French, but we provide English equivalents in this paper. The relevance of the
four questions will be illustrated with reference to the computer network example where each node has an associated
machine name.
The first question considers the degree of a node with attributes. The question is local, and is primarily an attribute
task that depends on graph topology:
1. Which colour is the most connected to the black
hexagon?
c 2010 The Author(s)
Journal compilation c 2010 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In the demonstration session, the participants were explained that colour meant the colour of the original nodes in
the graph and not the metanodes for this question. The four
different attribute values, represented by each colour, are offered as four possible answers. In our computer networking
example, this question relates to understanding server interconnections.
The second question is global and purely based on the
attribute information present in the graph and did not depend
at all on graph topology. This question asked:
2. Which colour is the most present in the graph?
The four different attribute values, represented by each
colour, are offered as four possible answers. In our computer
networking example, this question relates to determining the
types of machines at the centre of the network.
The third question tests if participants could trace sets of
paths through the graph. The question is a global/topology
task that depends on attribute information.

1178

3. Which of the following paths is a valid path from the
hexagon to the pentagon?
Four sequences of colours are offered as possible answers.
The maximum length of a sequence used in the experiment
is four. Only one sequence exists as a valid sequence of
colours from the hexagon to the pentagon. If a sequence
contains multiple nodes of the same colour in a row, for
example red-red-red-blue-blue-red, the multiple instances of
the same colour were collapsed down to a single instance in
the answers, red-blue-red. Participants were notified of this
property at the beginning of the experiment. This question
tests the readability of path-preserving decompositions. In
our computer networking example, this question may help
in finding outlying paths to strange machines in the network.
The final question tests if small cycles of three to five
nodes are readable around a node. The question is local and
focuses on topology but depends on attribute information.
4. Which is a valid cycle that contains the hexagon?
As above, four sequences of colours are offered as possible answers. The maximum length of a sequence used in the
experiment is four. Only one sequence is a valid cycle that
contains the hexagon. If a sequence contains multiple nodes
of the same colour in a row, they were collapsed down to a
single instance in the answers, and participants were made
aware of this property. This question tests the readability of
path-preserving decompositions. In our computer networking example, this question has similar motivations to question 3, but is more local in nature.
We posed multiple choice questions based on the focus
nodes, rather than asking the participants to interact with the
graphs on the screen. Multiple choice questions were preferable to participant interaction because questions one and two
did not require identifying specific nodes. Also, questions
three and four would require clicking on a fewer number of
nodes in the PPC condition, introducing a bias against the
NC condition.
3.4. Experimental Design
Before each condition, the interface was demonstrated to the
participant. These demonstrations allowed the participants to
ask questions, to find out about the experimental tasks, and
to see how the answers could be found. The experimental
procedure required answering all questions under one condition first followed by all those in the other condition. Therefore, any cognitive shift required to move from one interface
to another was incurred only once. We counterbalanced between participants by presenting the NC condition first to
even-numbered participants and the PPC condition first to
odd-numbered participants. At the end of the experiment,
participants were asked to complete a short survey in order
to compile preference data.
There were twenty-four experimental tasks for each condition: 6 data sets and 4 questions with no time limit imposed

on the tasks. For each participant, this sequence of twentyfour questions was randomized differently for each condition in order to counter any learning effect. Each set of questions was prefixed with a set of six practice questions. These
six questions presented each data set once and each question
at least once to the participant. Participants were not made
aware that these practice questions did not form part of the
experiment. Therefore, thirty questions were answered per
condition, giving a total of sixty questions.
We had four versions of questions 1, 3, and 4 on each
data set at our disposal. As each question on each data set
is asked at most twice under one condition, once as a practice question and once during the experiment, we ensured
that the same version of the question was never asked twice
to the same participant. Versions were randomized so that
sometimes a particular version of a question was a practice
question and sometimes it was used as experimental data.
Question 2 was asked as a practice question and as data for
one random data set under each condition.
Both conditions were rendered using the Tulip framework [Aub03]. For all four questions, participants responded
by selecting a radio button with the correct answer and committed their answer with a push button at the bottom of the
interface. The radio buttons were labeled with answers as
described in section 3.3. Participants typically completed the
experiment between sixty and ninety minutes. Twenty-eight
subjects (21 male, 7 female) participated in the experiment.
4. Results
Our pilot experiments suggested that the size of the graph
was an important factor, and that very large graphs would
produce a ceiling effect in the data: in very large graphs, the
tasks would be so difficult that few participants would get
any of the tasks right, and there would be no variation in
the data. We subsequently reduced the size of the medium
and large data sets of IMDB to the sizes presented in this
paper, because of the difficulty that our pilot subjects had
with the experiment. We were certain that graph size would
have an effect on performance but were not sure to what degree. Also, graph connectivity could possibly influence our
results, but again, we were uncertain to what degree.
Our analysis was performed in three stages. In the first
stage, we consider the effect of our conditions, NC and PPC,
on an overall and a per question basis. Section 4.1 presents
these results. Subsequently, we examined the effects of size
and graph connectivity on an overall and, sometimes, on a
per-question basis. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 present these results.
A non-parametric, repeated-measures, exact Wilcoxon
signed rank test was chosen for our analysis because the data
collected was not normally distributed, and we were always
comparing only two conditions (NC vs PPC). A standard
significance level of α = 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance between conditions. When splitting the data

4.1.1. By Question
Subdividing the data by question, we find that for question
2, “Which colour is the most present in the graph?”, NC is
significantly faster than PPC (p = 0.002), but PPC produced
significantly fewer errors (p = 0.018). A positive correlation
of 0.23 (p = 1.6 × 10−5 ) between time and error indicates
that faster response times did not lead to more errors. No
other significant difference was found.
4.2. Effect of Graph Size
Figure 5 presents the results of one of our secondary research
questions which examined the effect of graph size.
Considering only the small data, we found no significant
difference in terms of response time or error rate either overall or per question.
When analyzing only the medium data, we found that

the PPC condition produced significantly fewer errors (p =
0.001) with no significant difference in response time.
As our questions depend on attributes and topology differently, we divided this data a third time by question to see
where the significant difference in error rate was present.
Figure 6 shows the results of this analysis. For question 1,
the NC condition produced significantly fewer errors (p =
0.002) than PPC. For question 2, PPC produced significantly
fewer errors than NC (p = 0.00098). In question 3, PPC produced significantly fewer errors than NC (p = 0.00098). We
did not find any significant difference in terms of error rate
for question 4. No other significant difference was found.
When analyzing only the large data, on question 2, we
found that NC was significantly faster than PPC (p = 3.7 ×

4.4. Survey Data
Our interviews with the participants revealed that they typically did not find this experiment too difficult and many of
them were confident in their answers. The majority of participants reported not spending too much time searching for
the focus nodes in the experiment, either the hexagon or the
pentagon, and therefore the most of the response time was
spent actually reading the graph, as was intended.
Overall and on a per question basis, participants tended to
prefer the PPC condition. However, for answering question
1, participants were less supportive of it.

On IMDB, we found no significant difference in terms of
response time. However, PPC produced significantly fewer
errors than NC globally on this data (p = 0.002). In an attempt to discover where this difference was located, we subsequently divided the data by question but did not find a significant difference in terms of error rate. No other significant
difference was found.

5.1. Which is better: PPC or NC?

Therefore, we cannot claim that either one is better or worse
than the other overall. This is a very interesting result: while
the intuitions of algorithm designers may be that providing
a two-level hierarchy will be useful to the user, this data reveals that this is not necessarily always the case.

When comparing all data for NC to PPC, we did not find significant differences in terms of response time or error rate.

Using PPC for question 2 produced significantly fewer errors than NC, but PPC was significantly slower. A positive

correlation between time and errors suggests that faster answers did not lead to more errors, and therefore the interaction between time and error does not affect these two conclusions. This would indicate that the two-level graph hierarchy
helped participants judge the number of nodes of a given attribute value in the graph. As node size was proportional to
the number of nodes within a metanode, the larger surface
area would have helped the participant judge the colour of
the node. Also, the size of the metanode may have provided
a good summary of the number of nodes it contains.

5.2. Does the size of the graph make a difference?
When dividing the data by size, we did not find a significant difference between the NC and the PPC conditions for
the small and large graphs, however, we found that there
were significantly fewer errors in the PPC condition for the
medium graphs, particularly with questions 2 and 3.
As questions 2 and 3 are global questions, one focusing
on attributes and the other on topology, it seems that the
two-level graph hierarchy helped the participants read global
properties of the medium graphs that depend on attributes.
It is surprising that the only size effects were found in the
medium graphs, rather than at either of the extremes. It is
possible that the simplicity of the small graphs meant that
the clustering brings no advantage. With larger graphs, if the
two-level graph hierarchy is less effective at simplifying the
graph into a few large metanodes, performance might degrade. Figure 9 reports the number of nodes and edges at
the metanode level of the hierarchy. PPC reduced the number of metanodes in the medium data sets more effectively,
possibly improving readability.
Question 1 was local, and we found that PPC produced
significantly more errors than NC on the medium data. As
the question purely depends on local information, it may be
the case that the two-level graph hierarchy complicated matters when trying to answer this question.
As a design guideline, two-level, path-preserving hierarchies can help performance on global tasks, both in terms of
topology and attributes, when the data can be divided into a
few large metanodes. However, for local/attribute questions,
under these same conditions, it may hinder performance.

5.3. Does the connectivity of the graph make a
difference?
In terms of graph connectivity, we found that for high connectivity graphs, the PPC condition produced significantly
fewer errors than the NC condition over all tasks. This key
result suggests that this type of clustering can help users understand high connectivity data. This finding could be due to
the fact that metanodes may simplify a lot of the edge crossings present in the graph, an important factor in improving
graph readability [Pur97].
5.4. Limitations
All experiments are limited by their parameters and results
are generalizable only within the scope of those parameters.
Three sizes of graphs were acquired from real world data
sources. The two graphs chosen have different levels of connectivity. We chose a variety of different tasks for reading a
graph with attributes, and analyzed our data separately according to these tasks. By highlighting the relevant nodes to
the question in black and making them relatively larger, we
minimized the effect of visual search. The majority of our
participants had a computer science background, but some
mathematical knowledge is helpful for these tasks.
6. Conclusion and Future Work
In future work, our result suggests that coarsening techniques [AvHK06, AMA08, Arc09, vHWV09], which merge
several small metanodes into a few large ones, could provide benefits in terms of graph readability. Similarly, pathpreserving hierarchies recursively coarsen a graph. Our experiment suggests that each level of the hierarchy should
contain a small number of large metanodes that are subdivided at lower levels or that deeper hierarchies may provide
a benefit. However, in both cases, further study is needed.
Most of our questions, following paths, cycles, and adjacency could be adapted for testing multi-level hierarchies.
In this experiment, we provide evidence that pathpreserving flat clusterings of graphs do not always help
users read a graph with attributes associated with the nodes.
Overall, we did not find a significant difference when this
type of clustering was used. However, if the graph is highly
connected, such a representation can improve performance.
Also, if the graph is large enough and can be simplified into
a few metanodes, benefits in performance on global tasks
are realized. Under these same conditions, however, local attribute tasks may have reduced performance.
