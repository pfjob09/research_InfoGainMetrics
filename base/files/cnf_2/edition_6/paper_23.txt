Abstract
This paper proposes two variants of a simple but efficient algorithm for structure-preserving halftoning. Our
algorithm extends Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion; the goal of our extension is not only to produce good tone
similarity but also to preserve structure and especially contrast, motivated by our intuition that human perception
is sensitive to contrast. By enhancing contrast we attempt to preserve and enhance structure also.
Our basic algorithm employs an adaptive, contrast-aware mask. To enhance contrast, darker pixels should be
more likely to be chosen as black pixels while lighter pixels should be more likely to be set as white. Therefore,
when the positive error is diffused to nearby pixels in a mask, the dark pixels absorb less error and the light pixels
absorb more. Conversely, negative error is distributed preferentially to dark pixels. We also propose using a mask
with values that drop off steeply from the centre, intended to promote good spatial distribution. It is a very fast
method whose speed mainly depends on the size of the mask. But this method suffers from distracting patterns.
We then propose a variant on the basic idea which overcomes the first algorithm’s shortcomings while maintaining
its advantages through a priority-aware scheme. Rather than proceeding in random or raster order, we sort the
image first; each pixel is assigned a priority based on its up-to-date distance to black or to white, and pixels with
extreme intensities are processed earlier. Since we use the same mask strategy as before, we promote good spatial
distribution and high contrast.
We use tone similarity, structure similarity, and contrast similarity to validate our algorithm. Comparisons with
recent structure-aware algorithms show that our method gives better results without sacrificing speed.

tion, obtaining impressive structure preservation. Even more
recently, Chang et al. [CAO09] proposed structure-aware error diffusion (SAED): a non-iterative method that addresses
Pang et al.’s problem of low speed. Unfortunately, the structure preservation from SAED is lower than SAH. Therefore, we propose our more simple and efficient method
which gives higher structure quality. Some sample results
are shown in Figure 1.

Halftoning refers to converting a continuous-tone image into
a pattern of black and white dots [Uli87]. The key factors for
the quality of halftoning are the precise preservation of both
tone and structure from the original image, and the absence
of spurious patterns. How to satisfy and balance those factors
has inspired a lot of modern halftoning algorithms.
Halftoning methods are usually classified as three groups:
point processes such as dithering methods [BAY73, Uli87],
neighborhood processes such as error diffusion [FS74,
VG91, EK91, Ost01, ZF03, KRA06, CAO09], and iterative
methods [AA92, BTA03, PQW∗ 08]. Iterative methods, due
to their computational expense, did not attract many researchers for a long time. However, recently, Pang et
al. [PQW∗ 08] presented structure-aware halftoning (SAH),
which uses an iterative policy to optimize an objective func-

We are motivated by the observation that contrast [Bad88,
HW97, Reg00] is an important consideration in human perception of an image. Our contrast-aware methods are intended to extend classic error diffusion with considerations
of contrast preservation. We propose dynamically calculating the priority of every pixel as we proceed through the
halftoning process, which further improves our contrastaware scheme. The notion of a dynamic importance map

has been previously used in non-photorealistic rendering [Her98] but to our knowledge has not been applied to
halftoning. We demonstrate superior structure preservation
to both SAH [PQW∗ 08] and SAED [CAO09] with speed
competitive with SAED.
In Section 2 we discuss previous research and present our
algorithms in Section 3. In Section 4 we give some sample
images and report quality measurements comparing our results with those of previous methods. We conclude our paper
in Section 5 and identify potential future work.
2. Previous Work
Early halftoning techniques were focused on the goal of
tone matching. Dithering methods such as ordered ditering [BAY73] represent the desired intensity with some defined pattern. Regular patterns and visual artifacts are the
main problem for this group of methods.
The well-known Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion (FSED)
technique [FS74] was developed to circumvent those problems. The intensity difference between the original image and the approximated intensity (black or white in
monochrome halftoning) – the error – is distributed to the
neighboring pixels, which encourages smoothness. Most of
modern halftoning methods cannot compete with error diffusion in tone reproduction. Following Floyd and Steinberg’s
idea, a great deal of work has been done in error diffusion [VG91, EK91, Ost01, ZF03, KRA06, CAO09]. Spurious patterns and lack of structure preservation are two big
drawbacks for methods of this type. A well-accepted solution to visual artifacts is to enforce blue noise properties into
halfoning [MP91, Ost01, BTA03, ZF03, KCODL06]. Ostromoukhov’s method [Ost01] is a typical method for generating blue noise property by using an off-line minimization
process for distributing coefficients over different intensity
levels. But Ostromoukhov’s method still does not attempt to
retain structure, thus loses fine texture details.
Structure-aware methods are a recent trend in halftoning.

Historically, image structure has been promoted by edge enhancement. Eschbach and Knox [EK91] employ an imagedependent threshold process to increase or decrease edge
enhancement for their error diffusion method. However it
fails on weak edges. Kwak et al. [KRA06] proposed an
edge enhancement method based on the human visual system (HVS). It turns out the quality of results from edge enhancement is not pleasing. In 2008, Pang et al. [PQW∗ 08]
applied an optimization process to minimize an objective
function balancing tonal control and structural adjustment
(the SAH algorithm); in 2009, Chang et al. [CAO09] use
a direct process for faster structure-preserving halftoning
(called SAED). Both of their research can be treated as the
state of art because the results from their methods are excellent. However, SAH is computationally expensive, which
makes it difficult to use in practice; SAED does not achieve
the same high level of structure similarity as SAH.
Contrast is a topic often neglected, though not inevitably.
Li et al. [Li06] propose an edge-directed error diffusion
method to preserve edges and contrast. In this method, diffusion halts at boundary edges; further, the algorithm’s parameters are adaptively modified based on a binary edge image. However, this method suffers from artifacts similar to
FSED. SAED [CAO09] uses contrast as a perceptual parameter in their calibration step. Marcu and Abe [MA96] gave a
halftoning variant where pixels are visited in intensity order,
but without much discussion and without dynamic updates
to the order. Their method can be seen as a precursor to ours.
3. Contrast-Aware Halftoning Algorithm
Traditional Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion [FS74] has very
good tone matching. In order to take full advantage of its
graceful tone matching property, the methods we describe
here are based on classic error diffusion; our innovation is to
distribute error through contrast-aware weights within a normalized mask. A variant method of our basic contrast-aware
method improves fine texture details, based on a flexible dynamic priority scheme.

3.1. Basic Algorithm

indicated as done:

The idea behind our contrast-sensitive method is simple. Local contrast in monochrome halftoning is derived from the
clustering of black pixels in a white area. If we observe
a structure well-preserved by halfoning, it means that the
black pixels are arranged to fall along the edges gracefully.
The local contrast will be promoted if we use more black
pixels in the dark side and fewer black pixels on the light
side; doing this enhances texture edges as well. This observation is at the core of our algorithm.
Our algorithm proceeds pixel by pixel. The first step is
to determine which color (black or white) should be chosen
for this pixel. If the input pixel is closer to black in intensity value, black is chosen; otherwise, white is chosen. Next,
the algorithm calculates the error between the original intensity and the chosen intensity (0 or 255) and the error is distributed to neighboring pixels based on our contrast-aware
mask. As the algorithm progresses, we want to maintain the
initial tendency that darker pixels should be more likely to be
set to black while lighter pixels should be more likely to be
set to white. A positive error, resulting from a dark pixel set
to black, means the surrounding area should be lightened; a
negative error, from a light pixel set to white, means the area
is too light already and the neighborhood should be darkened. Our policy is that when positive error is diffused to
nearby pixels, the darker pixels absorb less error and the light
pixels absorb more: this biases the result such that pixels
which were already lighter than their neighbors become even
lighter, while darker pixels remain dark. Conversely, negative error is distributed preferentially to dark pixels, making
them even darker.
The error is distributed within a circular mask centred on
the pixel. Boundary pixels have fewer image pixels beneath
the mask. Weights wst are calculated, and then normalized
weights wˆ st such that the sum of all wˆ st is unity. Error is
distributed to each pixel in proportion to its wˆ st . The weights
wst are computed as follows:
Ist
(rst )k
(255 − Ist )
else, wst =
(rst )k

if error > 0, wst =

(1)
(2)

In the preceding, Ist is the intensity of pixel s,t beneath the
mask, rst is the distance of pixel s,t from the mask centre,
and k is a parameter. We have intensity values ranging from
0 to 255. We produced our best results for balancing quality
and speed with k = 2.6 and a 7 by 7 mask.
The normalized weights are computed by dividing by the
sum of weights for all pixels within the mask region that
were not previously set to their final values; such pixels are

Wtotal =

(s,t)∈neighbors\done

wˆ st =

wst
Wtotal

(4)

The case Wtotal = 0 is called an isolated pixel and no distribution occurs in this case. Otherwise, pixels receive intensity
adjustments equal to their share of the error:
Ist ← Ist + error × wˆ st .

(5)

Note that the intensity adjustment of equation 5 might
result in overflow or underflow. In such cases, the pixel is
clamped to 0 or 255 and the excess is added to the residual.
The residual error also accounts for isolated pixels, which
can distribute none of their error to the neighborhood. We
carry residual error forward to the next pixel in the process.
The above algorithm is fairly effective at preserving tone
and structure, as our results will show. However, the raster
scanning order is too inflexible; it introduces visible artifacts, and also ignores some weak edges. Despite our contrast enhancement scheme, weak edges might be missed; it
might be that enough error is distributed to edge pixels to
overcome their initial disposition. Figure 6 displays some
missing weak edges in the “snail” example and Figure 3(a)
shows the visual artifacts. To maintain fine details without
losing much tone quality, we devised the following variant.
3.2. Dynamic Priority
Some results are shown in Figures 4 and 6 and indicate that
good structure fidelity is achieved even by the basic method.
However, the powerful virtue of the contrast-aware idea is
impaired by the inflexible scanning order. Our idea is to process the pixels closer to black or to white first, and treat the
intermediate pixels last, after they have received the error
from the nearby more extreme-valued neighbors.
Only a small modification to the basic procedure is needed
to implement this idea. We maintain a priority heap, sorting
all pixels by their intensity distance to black or to white. Initially, the heap contains all pixels with their initial distances.
At each step, the heap pops out a pixel with highest priority:
of all remaining pixels, the one with the smallest distance to
black or white. We apply the previous algorithm to this one
pixel, assigning it a final value and distributing the error to
its neighborhood. After the error distribution, many nearby
pixels will have changed their intensities, and correspondingly their priorities. We push the new values onto the heap;
in our implementation, there will be stale values in the heap,
which we can discover and discard by checking the popped
up pixel to verify that its priority is up-to-date. The process
continues until the heap is empty, at which point all pixels
will have been assigned a final value. In the dynamic priority variant, we found our best tradeoff between quality and
speed using k = 2 and a mask size of 7 by 7.

Table 1: Tone similarity measurement based on PSNR
From the results in Figures 1 and 6, this priority-based
scheme provides better structure detail than does the basic
method. In halftoning a uniform region, the pixels within
the mask will have their priorities reduced by the distributed
error; hence, the algorithm will choose a pixel outside of the
current mask as the next pixel, rather than being forced to
choose a neighboring pixel. Choosing a distant pixel reduces
clumping, somewhat emulating Poisson disc behavior and
producing a better spatial distribution. Also, within a mask,
the error is distributed in such a way as to preserve contrast.
An up-to-date local priority order lets us use all the available
information in deciding which pixel to treat next, which includes the history of distributed errors. Empirically, doing so
results in superior detail preservation.
4. Results and Evaluation
In the paper introducing SAED, Chang et al. [CAO09] stated
that their results have higher tone similarity measurement
and lower structure similarity measurement than the results
from SAH [PQW∗ 08]. We are mainly interested in structure
similarity: therefore, most of our results are compared with
results from SAH. We also provide the measurement data
in Table 1, 2, and 3 for Ostromoukhov [Ost01] method and
FSED [FS74] to benchmark against methods not specifically
designed for structure preservation. Figures 4, 5, and 6 give
a visual comparison of our methods with SAH and SAED.
All our evaluations are coded in Matlab. For comparison
with SAH and SAED, we followed the respective authors’
evaluation design, preprocessing both the original image and
the result with an 11 by 11 Gaussian filter, using σ of 2.0 for
tone measurement, 1.5 for structure measurement, and 0.5
for contrast measurement.
4.1. Tone Similarity
Tone similarity is usually measured by computing the PSNR
(peak signal-to-noise ratio) between two images. From
the comparisons given in Table 1, we see that our basic
contrast-aware method usually attains higher tone similarity
than SAH. Our variant contrast-aware approach has similar
scores as SAH. One reason for a little lower tone matching for some examples is that revealing subtle details usually requires more black pixels than strict tone matching
would allow. Another reason is that the basic method always
diffuses the error directly into the nearby pixels while the
variant method might transmit the error to a distant pixel
– e.g., when the isolated situation happens. Figure 2 shows
the comparison for the ramp intensity with recent methods.

Figure 2: Comparison for ramp intensity (From top to bottom: the original image, error diffusion, SAH [PQW∗ 08],
our basic method and our variant method)
Notice that our dynamic priority method eliminates the undesirable patterns near intensity 128 in the ramp, visible in
all previous methods.
4.2. Structure Similarity
We employ the mean structural similarity measure
(MSSIM) [WBSS04] to measure structure similarity. Table 2
shows that both our methods achieve higher measurement
in this test. A visual comparison can be found in Figure 5.
Our result shows the leaves very clearly; the deepness of the
shadows is stronger, and the faint halo along the right-hand
edge of the main bush is shown well. It is even possible to see
some texture in the far-away bush, which is not as visible in
the result from SAH. The underlying reason for these differences is that our local contrast enhancement strategy makes
sure to organize black pixels based on the structure edges,
and even improves the edges by emphasizing the pixels that
have values different from their neighbors.
Presumably the structure-aware halftoning method of
Pang et al. would be able to produce better structure similarity given more time. However, using the optimization
scheme as described, diminishing returns quickly set in and
it might take a prohibitively long time to realize significant
gains in structure quality. We have achieved better quality

is calculated in same the way as the tone similarity. We use
the method proposed by Matkovic et al. [MNN∗ 05] to measure contrast since it takes into account human perception.
The perceptual luminance L is obtained from modifying the
linear luminance with applying a gamma correction (γ = 2.2)
and the local contrast is averaging the local difference among
the neighbors. The equations are as follows,

positon of the center pixel while (s,t) are represented for
positions of four connected neighbors. As can be seen in
Table 3, both our algorithms have superior performance to
other methods on this metric.

Figure 3 gives a visual analysis of the blue-noise properties of our distribution. Figure 3(a) is generated by our
basic method and its RAPSD is shown as well; it contains
undesirable patterns. Using our variant method, we created
Figure 3(b); it is of better quality but lacks the blue-noise
property. The difficulty arises because the constant grayness
image has the same priority for all pixels; ties are broken using scanning order, with concomitant artifacts. Figure 3(d)
shows the result of a random tie-breaking mechanism: its
RAPSD plot shows the high frequency region goes flatter
than that from our basic method and thus the blue-noise
property is improved a lot. The improved result has similar
quality to the result from SAH, shown in Figure 3(c). Thus,
if we expect to see uniform regions, such as in cartoon-style
images like those of Figure 3(e) and (f), we should have the
ability to choose arbitrarily among pixels of equal priority.

4.5. Analysis
Timing: Table 4 gives our timing values. To attain the best
tradeoff between quality and speed, it takes 0.492 seconds
for CPU to run our basic method and 2.955 seconds for our
variant method to process halftoning on a 512 × 512 image
with a 7 × 7 mask. SAH’s paper [PQW∗ 08] reported processing time of 2 minutes for a 512 by 512 image. It takes
6.74 seconds for SAED [CAO09] in CPU time to reach their
best tradeoff while finishing the halftoning with a 16 × 16
mask. Thanks to our simple procedure, our methods achieve
faster speed while preserving quality. Our timing measurements are based on an Intel Core Duo CPU E8400@ 3.0GHz
with 3GB RAM.

Color halftoning: Digital color halftoning is a more complicated problem. For simplicity, both our basic and variant methods are applied separately to each RGB channel to
accomplish color halftoning. Figure 4 shows a comparison
with SAH [PQW∗ 08]. Our results show the structure more
clearly. Actually, color contrast is not a simple extension of
luminance contrast. A more sophisticated color halftoning
method would take into account interactions among colors.
5. Conclusion

(a) The original image

(b) SAH [PQW∗ 08]

In this paper we introduce contrast-aware methods as a powerful and useful extension to classic error diffusion. Due to
taking advantage of local contrast enhancement, we achieve
very high structure similarity with high tone quality. Our
weight function maintains local contrast by attracting more
error (or intensity) to light areas and increasing the likelihood that darker pixels will become black. The dynamic
priority-aware scheme, based on the steeply droping property from the center to the far away distance in each mask
emulates the Poisson-Disc behavior, thus generating a good
spatial distribution. The idea of introducing priority scheme
into halftoning is new and we demonstrate that it plays an
important role in producing good results. From comparisons with recent halftoning methods, we conclude that our
method is simple, easy to implement, totally automatic, effective, and has very fast speed. We also conclude that the
contrast is a very important factor when we generate halftoning or other digital styles. Also we demonstrate it can be extended into color halftoning.
Limitations and Future work: Since the proposed methods are not optimal, the black pixels are not perfectly spatially distributed. In particular, sometimes clumping happens. Even though we showed good results for our method,
we would like to further investigate its motivating assumption. Does higher contrast always have more appealing structure?

Figure 4: Color halftoning comparison.
The parameters: Mask size has a strong influence on
quality. Usually, a larger mask size gives higher quality in
structure preservation while a smaller mask produces higher
tone matching. We believe that this also indicates a structuretone tradeoff that will be encountered by other halftoning
algorithms. The parameter k we employ in our weight function gives some control over the degree of tone matching
and structure matching. For example, if k increases in some
range around 0.5 to 4, the values for MSSIM and CPSNR
are reduced, but the degree of tone matching is increased.

The influence of the shape of the mask should be researched further and interesting work might emerge. Other
image features such as local histogram, texture features, entropy, statistical factors might be very useful to adjust the
local contrast too. We mentioned before that color halftoning might be a future direction, and artistic styles generated
through pixel management provide further research topics.
