Traceless Tensor Properties

Abstract
A perceptual study of four tensor glyphs for symmetric, real, traceless tensors was performed. Each glyph encodes
three properties of the system: Orientation, uniaxiality (alignment along the direction of orientation), and biaxiality (alignment along a vector orthogonal to the orientation). Thirty users over two studies were asked to identify
these three properties for each glyph type under a variety of permutations in order to evaluate the effectiveness
of visually communicating the properties; response time was also measured. We discuss the significant differences
found between the methods as guidance to the use of these glyphs for traceless tensor visualization.

glyphs for NLC tensors span the range of common shapes—
boxes, cylinders, ellipsoids, and superquadrics. To the best
of our knowledge, a study comparing the efficacy of these
four canonical glyphs has not been performed.

1. Introduction
Tensor visualization seeks to describe volumetric or other
high-dimensional properties of a system. One approach for
depicting tensors is the use of glyphs: 3D shapes that act
as icons encoding different parameters of the tensor [All89,
AWB01, BH04, JKM06, KWH00, KW99, Kin04, SEHW02,
SPL∗ 06,SKH95,ZLK04]. An important issue in glyph visualization is the comprehensibility of such markers—how accurately do they communicate tensor characteristics? Ebert
and others have investigated superquadric glyphs for general high dimension visualization [ERS∗ 00, SEK∗ 98]; but
that study leaves open the question of the effectiveness of
established tensor glyphs. In this work, we report the results
of an empirical study to address that question, using nematic
liquid crystal alignment tensors as basis.

2. Nematic Liquid Crystal Alignment
To understand NLC tensor glyphs, some background in NLC
physics is required. Nematic liquid crystals are an intermediary state of matter between solid and liquid states wherein
molecules have no long range positional order but exhibit
local orientation alignment [Col02]. NLCs are often composed of molecular chains that posses rotational symmetry. Each individual NLC molecule can be said to orient
along the molecule’s axis of rotational symmetry. Depending on the environmental conditions and the nature of the
NLC medium, groups of these molecules tend to align their
rotational axes in different configurations (Figure 1). It is
the type and strength of these macro-molecular orientations
which are of interest to liquid crystal physicists.

As a case study, nematic liquid crystal (NLC) alignment
visualization exhibits interesting properties. First, the NLC
tensor is symmetric, real, and traceless, possessing different properties than the more common non-traceless tensors
seen in DT-MRI visualization [ZLK04]. However, both NLC
and DT-MRI visualization utilize the tensor’s eigenvalues to
construct their shapes, so lessons from one are applicable to
the other. Second, NLC systems have clear physical parameters (orientation, alignment strength, and strength of symmetry) that need to be communicated. Finally, the existing

Mathematically, the physics of the alignment of an NLC
medium is represented by a second-order, real symmetric
traceless tensor known as the alignment tensor Q [dG74,
MN04]. This tensor encapsulates the director n ( the average
orientation of the molecules), the strength of the alignment

S = 1 when all the molecules are aligned with n (Figure 1,

when the system is fully negative uniaxial (Figure 1, right).
Similarly, the largest (in terms of absolute value) eigenvalue
λ1 is positive when S is positive, zero when isotropic, and
negative otherwise. The tensor is in fact traceless so that

Of note is the relationship between the biaxiality and the
sign of S—when the system is such that λ1 = −λ2 (and thus
b is maximum), the sign of S (and thus the system) is undefined. Essentially, in this neutral biaxial state (Figure 1,
right-middle), there is equal alignment with the director and
the second symmetry axis. NLC tensor glyphs must thus allow distinction between these four states and gradations between them; these four states also are the extreme four states
any real symmetric traceless tensor can take.

2.1. NLC Tensor Visualization
Excluding position, an NLC tensor glyph must encode three
pieces of information: the director (orientation) n, the scalar
order parameter (uniaxial alignment strength) S, and the
amount of biaxiality b. Instead of using these parameters directly, tensor visualization methods have used the eigensystem values. Table 1 summarizes how several NLC glyphs are
constructed; Figure 2 depicts exemplar glyphs for different
orientations, uniaxial strength, and biaxial strength.
Each of the four glyph types uses a different base shape;
these shapes emphasize different aspects of the NLC system.

values. See Section 3.2 for their construction.

The box-shaped glyphs, described by Sonnet et al. [SKH95],
highlight the amount of biaxiality in a system—biaxiality
increases the amount of reflective (non-rotational) symmetry in the system, a feature prominent in rectangular
shapes. Cylindrical glyphs [AWB01] are naturally rotationc 2010 The Author(s)

ally symmetric and strongly suggest orientation along the
long axis of the shape. Ellipsoidal glyphs, described first for
NLC physics by Allen [All89] and used subsequently elsewhere [FWZ01, SPL∗ 06], can vary their different symmetries by changing the ratio of the major, medium, and minor
axes. Finally, superellipsoids [JKM06] not only change their
symmetry, but their underlying shape; the superellipsoid
shape parameters vary between box-, sphere-, and cylinderlike appearance depending upon the NLC tensor. While the
perceptual saliency of superquadrics have been studied in
general visualization [ERS∗ 00], we have found no work that
has previously studied the effectiveness of the four major
NLC tensor glyphs. That is the purpose of our study.
3. First Tensor Glyph Experiment
To evaluate the different real symmetric traceless tensor
glyphs, we designed an experimental framework to measure
a user’s comprehension of the three properties communic 2010 The Author(s)

• Under orientation, glyphs representing different tensor
values may appear the same due to lighting (ellipsoids are
known for this behavior [Kin04]). We wished to find out
how orientation affects the perceived values of the other
glyphs parameters.
• The four glyphs highlight different aspects of the system.
We wanted to discover if the more versatile glyphs (ellipsoid and superellipsoid) would communicate the tensor
parameters more accurately.
• Though shape perception is rapid in the visual system, the conjunctive properties of glyphs (orientation,
shape, lengths, etc.) make their comprehension more difficult [War04]. Thus, we measured response time in order
to determine the difficulty in understanding each glyph.
In NLC tensor visualizations, glyphs are not displayed
alone; a volume is populated with glyphs to communicate
the spatial behavior of the NLC substrate. Such a study is
beyond the scope of this effort. Our focus is on understanding how single glyphs are comprehended; further work on
the larger scope is an eventual goal.
3.1. Experimental Task
Our experimental framework includes a user interface for
testing (Figure 3). For each trial, a single glyph was presented to the user. The user was then prompted to click on
the button which identified the glyph’s orientation and then
click on the button corresponding to the glyph’s combined
uniaxial and biaxial properties; users were free to select the
uniaxial/biaxial properties before orientation if desired and
were allowed to change their selection. Once a final selection
of properties was made, the user clicked the “Next” button
to record their choices and response time, and view another
glyph. This process was repeated until all combinations of
glyphs were seen.

All subjects viewed glyphs on the same LCD monitor in
the same lab space; a laptop connected to an external mouse
was used as the experimental machine. Directional lighting
for the glyphs came from l = [3, 2, 4] in eye coordinates (just
off one of the main diagonals), and all glyphs were rendered
using the same number of polygons. The software was written in C++ using OpenGL and wxWidgets.
3.2. Variables and Design
3.2.1. Independent variables
Table 2 enumerates the experimental variables used in our
glyph study. Our four independent variables sample the
space of possible tensors over the tested glyph types. A
roughly uniform sampling was used to cover the glyph space
while limiting the total number to minimize subject fatigue
during the experiment. These variables are described next.
Subjects Seventeen subjects were recruited from a population of undergraduate and graduate students varying in
age from 19–28; most were electrical/computer engineers
or computer scientists, with additional students from Business Information Systems and Industrial Engineering. One
participant was female. Each participant was given a spatial
ability test based on other’s tests [Det, TFU04] as a screening method; all subjects but one scored at least 75%, with an
mean of 89% ± 11%. Subjects were unpaid volunteers.
Glyph Type In our first experiment, five glyph types
were presented to the user. Four of them correspond to

the shapes previously mentioned: Boxes [SKH95], cylinders [AWB01], ellipsoids [All89, FWZ01, SPL∗ 06], and superquadric (“super-e”) [JKM06]. A fifth glyph, a modified
ellipsoid, was determined after testing to be an incorrect implementation of a previous method that was covered by our
extant ellipsoidal glyph. Since the fifth glyph type did not
properly encode the tensor parameters (it was always rotational symmetric, failing to encode biaxiality), its results
were discarded and are not reported.
Orientation Canonically, our glyphs are aligned with xˆ
before rotation; the orientation variable determines this rotation. Four orientations were used: Bottom-to-top (“B-T”)
along +ˆy in the eye-coordinate frame, far-to-near (“F-N”)
along +ˆz, left-bottom-far to right-top-near (“LBF-RTN”)
along vLBF-RTN = [1, 1, 1], and right-bottom-far to left-topnear (“RBF-LTN”) along vRBF-LTN = [−1, 1, 1]. Since the
director is headless (vector sign is irrelevant), these directions cover four out of seven major directions on a hemi-cube
(towards its faces or corners). Two directions are on-axis
to minimize depth effects; one of the off-axis orientations
is nearly parallel with the scene’s light to evaluate shading.
Adding additional orientations, while providing an more indepth look at the space, would unreasonably increase the experimentation time to over two hours based upon our test
results; the orientations chosen exhibit the most differences.
It is important to note that in the isotropic case (when Q =
0 and S = 0), orientation is undefined. Thus, though a canonical orientation was provided to the experimental framework,
all orientations were accepted as valid user-selected values.
Uniaxiality The strength of uniaxial alignment determines the amount by which the molecules align along the
director (positive) or in the plane orthogonal to the director
(negative) [MN04, Muk98]. When aligned with the director,
the shape is elongated along that orientation like a rod; when
aligned with the plane orthogonal, the shape is compressed
with respect to the orientation like a disc. In between, in the
isotropic case, there is no alignment, and the shape is essentially a sphere or other regular shape. We used this intuitive metaphor—elongation along or compression against
the orientation—to describe the uniaxiality property to users;
the term uniaxial was never used.
For the experiment, five levels of uniaxial strength
(or elongation/compression) where used: Maximally compressed (“−−” at S = − 12 ), somewhat compressed (“−” at
S = − 14 ), neither compressed or elongated (“0” at S = 0),
somewhat elongated (“+” at S = 12 ) and maximally elongated (“++” at S = 1).
Biaxiality In a pure uniaxial configuration, nematic
molecules are rotationally symmetric. As biaxiality increases, the collection of molecules exhibit increasing reflective symmetry. This process is akin to flattening a tensor
shape parallel to the director to introduce the reflective symmetry. As in the uniaxial case, we used the intuitive concept

of “flattening” to describe biaxiality. Three levels of biaxiality/flattening were used in the study: No flattening (“0” at
b = 0), some flattening (“−” at b = 12 bmax ), and maximum
flattening (“−−” at b = bmax ) where bmax = 13 |S| is the relative maximum biaxiality for a given uniaxial arrangement. In
cases where the level of biaxiality was invalid (such for any
non-zero b when S = 0), users were not allowed to provide
that option (no button for the S/b combination existed in the
user interface (Figure 3)). For all glyphs, the axis of biaxiality m—the axis with the larger absolute eigenvalue—was
always yˆ in the glyph’s local frame (i.e., before rotation).
3.2.2. Dependent variables
Two sets of dependent variables were gathered: Error metrics for each tensor property and the user’s response time.
Error Metrics For each major tensor property (orientation, uniaxiality, and biaxiality), an error metric is defined.
Orientation errors are binary: Either the user selected the
correct orientation or an error occurred; no gradation between orientations is used. Finer distinctions are used for
uniaxial and biaxial error: The error is the signed distance
from the user’s selection and the correct selection. Given the
range of uniaxial selections (-2 to 2) and biaxial selections
(-2 to 0), the possible error values are between -4 and 4 for
uniaxial error and -2 to 2 for biaxial error respectively. This
distance is not based upon the tensor values (S or b) but on
the user perceived values (e.g., −− or +). This distinction
facilitates data analysis and better matches the user’s model
of the problem as they were not privy to the internal workings of the tensor representation.
To represent total error, the sum of errors was normalized;
the absolute value of the normalized uniaxial and biaxial errors were used to ignore sign. This error terms gives equal
weight to each of the three errors.
Response Time The time for a subject to select the glyph
properties and move to the next glyph was recorded; all
times are measured in seconds. No timeout was used; subjects could take as much time as they wanted.
3.2.3. Experimental Procedure
A 5 × 4 × 5 × 3 factorial nesting of the independent variables
from Table 2 was used to gather data. To account for learning
and fatigue effects, we counterbalanced presentation order
using a 5 × 5 Latin square for the primary variable (glyph)
and random permutations for the other variables. The study
was a within-subjects design; each user saw all valid combinations of variables. 4080 data points were gathered (12
combinations of uniaxiality and biaxiality per orientation ×
4 orientations × 5 glyphs types (including the unreported
glyph) × 17 users). With the invalid glyph removed, 3264
data points were analyzed.
For each subject, the study progressed through several
stages. First, the users signed a consent form and took

the spatial ability test previously mentioned. The users
were then given a set of cards representing each glyph
type (a larger reproduction of Figure 2, one card for each
glyph type) and the three parameters (orientation, elongation/compression, and flatness) were described. The users
were then shown a common set of 10 glyphs as part of a practice period. Afterwards, the subjects completed 5 blocks of
48 trials—one repetition of every combination of glyph parameters. Since fully learning each glyph would likely take
longer than the allotted testing period, subjects were allowed
to keep the reference cards. After the trials, subjects were
asked a follow-up questionnaire to evaluate the design of the
study. All together, the subjects took 90 to 120 minutes to
complete the entire experimental procedure.
4. First Experiment Results
For the 17 subjects, a total of 3264 trials were completed,
each providing four error metrics and a response time. We
analyzed the data using error plots, a χ2 test for orientation
error, and balanced analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the
other measures. When using ANOVA, our experiment was
modeled as a repeated-measures design using subject as a
random factor and the other independent variables as fixed.
Since our experiment is a within-subjects design, ANOVA’s
assumptions about the normal distribution of measures and
homogeneity of variance could be violated. Thus, as per
Howell (p. 486) [How02], we applied the Huynh-Feldt correction ε to each F-test by modifying the test’s degrees of
freedom by ε; this results in a more conservative test that
corrects for lack of sphericity (validity of ANOVA’s assumptions). At no time during our analysis did the Huynh-Feldt
correction change the results of an F-test from significant to
non-significant. Table 3 tabulates the ANOVA tests.
Before analysis, we processed outliers for the response
time data using the method of Barnett and Lewis [BL94].
Histograms for each dependent measure were examined. A
bimodal distribution was observed for orientation error, a
multimodal distribution for total error, a skewed normal distribution for response time, and a symmetric normal distributions for uniaxial and biaxial error. Large numbers of outliers (found in the distribution’s tails after gaps) were only
found in the response time data; each was replaced by the
median of the other values sharing the same subject, glyph,
and orientation. As outliers are treated as mistaken values,
this method improves the calculations of statistics relevant to
the ANOVA (means, standard errors, and sum-of-squares),
which would otherwise be adversely affected by the outlying terms. As a final part of preparing the analysis, we tested
for learning and fatigue effects; we did not find evidence of
either within the results and thus do not address them.

find individual differences. Overall, the cylinder and superellipsoid glyphs accurately communicate the director regardless of orientation.

To analyze orientation errors due to glyph type, we first
examined the frequency of orientation error for each glyph
type. Of our 3264 data points, only 126 (3.9%) had orientation errors, and we did find an effect of glyph type among
these errors (χ2 (3) = 159.0, p < 0.001). Superellipsoids (1
orientation error) and cylinders (6 errors) fared much better
than ellipsoid (29 errors) and box glyphs (90 errors). As anticipated, ellipsoids exhibit more errors due to rotation than
the superellipsoids and cylinders which both use shape to
indicate the direction of alignment. What is surprising, however, is that boxes perform so poorly —the box glyph also
indicates the director’s direction using shape. To explain this
finding requires further analysis.

4.2. Glyphs and Other Errors

As for ellipsoids, unlike the other glyphs, their mean
error increases with off-axis alignments (Figure 4, LBFRTN and RBF-LTN orientations). If we study the non-box
glyphs, the main effect of orientation and the glyph by orientation are eliminated, leaving the main effect of glyph
only (F (1.1, 17.3) = 5.45, p = 0.03, ε = 0.541). This suggest there is a difference amongst the three remaining glyph
types, although post-hoc comparison of the means did not

We next investigated the interaction between glyph and
orientation on orientation error (Figure 4). We found a main
effect of glyph (Table 3a) and a main effect of orientation
(Table 3b); both effects are explained by a glyph by orientation interaction (Table 3c). This interaction clarifies the
source of orientation error for box glyphs: Errors predominate for on-axis alignments (B-T and F-N). In this configurations, no lighting cues are present—the box surface is flat
shaded. It is thus likely that the B-T and F-N orientations
are being confused. When strong lighting cues are present
(off-axis orientations), the mean error rate falls dramatically.

We used ANOVA to compare the remaining glyph error metrics. For uniaxial error, there was no main effect of glyph
(Table 3d), but there was a main effect for orientation (Table 3e) and a glyph by orientation interaction (Table 3f). Figure 5 depicts the interaction between glyph type and orientation for uniaxial error. Subjects tended to underestimate uniaxiality for non-canonical orientations (ones not B-T, differences are significant from post-hoc analysis with p < 0.025).
The non-box glyphs followed roughly the same trend for
uniaxiality; their differences are still significant and the interaction is removed if the box glyph is excluded from the
analysis (F (2.7, 43.8) = 4.7, p = 0.007, ε = 0.913). Examining the graph, box glyphs again performed poorly for the
on-axis alignments, especially in the F-N case. For the box

glyphs, uniaxiality is encoded along the director, and because the director is parallel to the viewer in the F-N orientation, uniaxiality is visually lost in this case.
For biaxial error, there was no main effect of glyph (Table 3g), but there was a main effect of orientation (Table 3h)
and a glyph by orientation interaction (Table 3i). Figure 6 depicts the interaction between glyph type and orientation for
biaxial error. Here users tended to underestimate for axisaligned configurations (negative values indicate more biaxiality in the figure); individual differences between the B-T
configuration and all others and F-N and the off-axis configurations were significant in post-hoc analysis (p < 0.002).
Biaxiality errors were overall smaller in the off-axis orientations. All the glyphs use the relative difference of widths
along the medium and minor eigenvectors to encode biaxiality; only superellipsoids also use shape to visually encode
this parameter. Since this relative difference cannot be seen
in the B-T case, subjects had a harder time identifying the
biaxiality for non-superellipsoids. For the other orientations,
the relative difference can be seen, explaining the decrease
in error. Unlike the other glyphs, superellipsoids maintained
a constant level of error for all orientations, a slight overestimation.
Total error (Figure 7) exhibits effects that combine its
three components. Analysis shows that total error has a main
effect of glyph and orientation with a glyph by orientation
interaction (Table 3k–l). The trends of the box and ellipsoid
errors follow that of their orientation error (Figure 4), indicating that orientation error dominates for these glyphs. The
profile for cylinder and superellipsoid glyphs are roughly
flat; however, cylinder glyphs have more total error overall,
most likely from the influence of its biaxial errors (Figure 6).
Post-hoc analysis of the difference between the means shows
the superellipsoid’s error is significantly lower than the other
glyphs; significant differences are also found between cylinders and boxes overall (Table 4).

4.3. Glyphs and Response Time
Subjects’ response time exhibited complex behavior. No
main effect due to glyph or orientation was observed (Table 3m,n); however, there was an interaction between the
two (Table 3o). We did not see this interaction again in the
follow-up experiment, nor were the differences between the
means significant, so there is little conclusive that may be
said about the response time differences.

5. Second Experiment
Though our first experiment showed strong statistical results,
we wanted to ensure that the additional time taken by subjects to process the fifth, unreported glyph type did not affect their overall behavior significantly. To this end, we ran a
second iteration of the experiment identical to the first with
the erroneous glyph type removed; we used a 4 × 4 balanced
Latin square to counterbalance glyph presentation order, and
all other aspects of the design were the same. Eleven male
and two female subjects between the ages of 23–34 were
tested from a similar population as before; no subject took
the experiment both times. For the 13 subjects, 2496 trials
were completed; we performed a similar analysis as before
on this data. The significant results of the ANOVA tests are
found in Table 5.
Overall, the results of the second study followed those of
the first. As before, only 3% (81 out of 2496) of the trials had
orientations errors; the different number of errors (55 box,
4 cylinder, 18 ellipsoid, 4 superellipsoid) were significant
(χ2 (3) = 86.0, p < 0.001), with boxes dominating. All previously significant results in the first experiment were significant in the second experiment save for response time which
showed no significant interaction (F (8.0, 96.4) = 50.5, p =
0.175, ε = 0.892); a new (weak) interaction of glyph and
orientation for uniaxial error was also observed (Table 5d).
There were significant post-hoc differences between the box
glyph and the other glyphs for orientation error (p < 0.001
at the highest) as it continued to fair poorly for axis-aligned
configuration. Biaxial error followed a similar trend as in
the first experiment with significant post-hoc differences
between the F-N and off-axis configurations (p < 0.008);
trends for the total error were essentially identical as before with superellipsoids performing significantly better than
the others in post-hoc analysis (p < 0.002). As for response
time, the loss of significant effect is possibly due to the
larger standard error and lower power compared to the first
experiment; more subjects would be needed to resolve this
effect. The behavior of the response time was largely different, although again superellipsoids provided the lowest
overall response time. Excluding response time, the second

study replicated the results of the first, indicating that the results reported here are reliable despite the presence of the
extraneous-glyph.
6. Discussion
Of the four glyph types studied, superquadric glyphs performed consistently better than the other glyphs, with lower
total error and generally lower response time over all orientations. Cylinders had low total error, though they exhibited more significant biaxiality errors than the superquadric
glyphs. With clear lighting (on-axis arrangements), ellipsoids faired quite well, with similar response times and total
error as cylinders. However, off-axis arrangements introduce
shading artifacts that seem to confound perception of the tensor properties and take longer to process. Finally, box glyphs
did poorly in the on-axis arrangements, especially with respect to uniaxiality. But, in contrast to ellipsoids, boxes exhibited relatively low error on the off-axis arrangements,
suggesting that lighting cues are more important to distinguish tensor properties for the faceted shape. Figure 8 summarizes the performance findings of our study.
Each of the four glyphs use different strategies to communicate the tensor parameters. The superquadric glyphs dually
encode each parameter: Orientation via the glyph’s alignment and the apex of the shape, uniaxiality via the shape
and height of the glyph, and biaxiality via the shape and
the relative width/depth of the glyph. The distinct change in
the glyph’s shape likely reduced the subjects’ error in identify the shape mentally or on the reference sheet. The strong
alignment cue of the cylinder glyph (its axis of rotation) kept
orientation error low; however, this same rotational symmetry seems to have interfered with perception of biaxiality. As
mentioned, ellipsoids faired poorly due to ambiguity; however, they did communicate biaxiality reasonably well. Finally, the reflective symmetry of the box did assist in conveying biaxiality (for orientations other than B-T), but the
shape had little other advantage.
Though the glyphs studied are specifically for nematic liquid crystal visualization, some lessons extend to wider tensor

We have presented a study evaluating the effectiveness
of four tensor glyphs for nematic liquid crystal visualization. Superquadrics glyphs performed best overall while box
glyphs performed the poorest; cylinders and ellipsoids fell
between. The redundant encoding of the superquadrics appears to address the visual ambiguity present in ellipsoidal
and box glyphs while correcting for the biaxiality issues of
the cylinder approach. Our findings also provide guidance to
other tensor glyphs.

Besides follow-up studies on collections of glyphs and
glyphs for other visualization domains, there is possible additional future work. Glyphs are not the only method to visualize NLC tensors; streamtubes and streamlines have also
been used [SPL∗ 06]. As these shapes must also communicate the tensor properties, a similar study could be conducted
to analyze their perceptual effectiveness.

depiction. All of our findings are directly applicable to general real symmetric traceless tensor visualization as the three
major properties of NLC glyphs—orientation, the size of the
major eigenvalue (uniaxiality) and amount of divergence of
the medium and minor eigenvalues (biaxiality)—have direct
analogs for general tensors. Our observation about the visual
ambiguity of ellipsoid glyphs validates the design motivation
of Kindlmann for his superquadric DT-MRI glyphs [Kin04];
however, the specific design of his glyphs has not been
tested. Similarly, our findings with regard to glyph type and
orientation are suggestive for non-superellipsoid glyphs, regardless of application. Our results imply that dual encoding of tensor parameters is beneficial, and should be factored
into future tensor glyph designs.
While this study answers several questions about tensor
glyphs, there are some caveats. Our work measures glyph
perception in isolation; it does not address the issue of larger
groups of glyphs. Though it is likely there are correlations
between the two settings, additional studies are needed to
fully address this issue. Secondly, this study does not address
learnability or expertise with regard to the glyphs; subjects’
exposure to the glyphs were too short and follow-up studies were not performed. Finally, encoding of tensor properties with means other than shape were not studied. Textures
