A BSTRACT
In this paper, we present a case study for the visualisation and analysis of large and complex temporal multivariate networks derived
from the Internet Movie DataBase (IMDB). Our approach is to integrate network analysis methods with visualisation in order to address scalability and complexity issues. In particular, we deﬁned
new analysis methods such as (p,q)-core and 4-ring to identify important dense subgraphs and short cycles from the huge bipartite
graphs. We applied island analysis for a speciﬁc time slice in order
to identify important and meaningful subgraphs. Further, a temporal Kevin Bacon graph and a temporal two mode network are
extracted in order to provide insight and knowledge on the evolution.

1 I NTRODUCTION
Recent technological advances have led to the production of a lot of
data, and consequently have led to many large and complex network
models across a number of domains. Examples include:
• Webgraphs: where the entities are web pages and relationships are hyperlinks; these are huge: the whole graph consists
of billions of nodes.
• Social networks: These include telephone call graphs (used
to trace terrorists), money movement networks (used to detect money laundering), and citation networks or collaboration networks. The size of the network can be medium to very
large.
• Biological networks: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, metabolic pathways, gene regulatory networks and
phylogenetic networks are used by biologists to analyse and
engineer biochemical materials. In general, they are smaller,
with thousands of nodes. However, the relationships in these
networks are very complex.

Understanding these networks is a key enabler for many applications. Good analysis methods are needed for these networks, and
some are available. However, such methods are not useful unless
the results are effectively communicated to humans. Visualisation
can be an effective tool for the understanding of such networks.
Good visualisation reveals the hidden structure of the networks and
ampliﬁes human understanding, thus leading to new insights, new
ﬁndings and possible predictions for the future.
We can identify the following challenging research issues for
analysis and visualisation of large and complex networks:
• Scalability: Webgraphs or telephone call graphs gathered by
AT&T have billions of nodes. In some cases, it is impossible
to visualise the whole graph, or one cannot possibly load the
whole graph in a main memory. Hence, the design of new
analysis and visualisation methods for huge networks is a key
research challenge from databases to computer graphics.
• Complexity: Relationships between actors in a social network, for example, can have a multitude of attributes (for example, observed behavior can be conﬁrmed or unconﬁrmed,
relationships can be directed or undirected, and weighted by
probabilities). Also, biological networks are quite complex
in nature; for example, metabolic pathways have only a few
thousand nodes, but their relationships and interactions are
very complex. The data may be given by nature, but some
parts of the data may be unknown to human scientists. The
design of analysis and visualisation methods to resolve these
complexity issues is the second research challenge.
• Network Dynamics: Real world networks are always changing over time. Many social networks, such as webgraphs,
evolve relatively slowly over time. In some cases, such as telephone call networks, the data is a very fast-streamed graph.
Effective and efﬁcient modeling, analysis and visualisation
for dynamic networks are challenging research topics.
One approach to solve these challenging issues is an integration of analysis with visualisation and interaction. Analysis tools
for networks are not useful without visualisation, and visualisation
tools are not useful unless they are linked to analysis. Further, interaction is necessary to ﬁnd out more details or insights from the
visualisation.
In this paper, we present a case study for our approach to integrating analysis, visualisation and interaction using large and complex temporal multivariate networks derived from the IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base). In general, the IMDB is a huge and very
rich data set with many attributes. Note that the IMDB data set has
become a challenging data set for visualisation researchers [7, 9].
For example, a multi-scale approach for visualisation of small
world networks was used for data sets from IMDB [3]. A visualization approach for dynamic afﬁliation networks in which events
are characterized by a set of descriptors was presented [6]. A radial ripple metaphor was devised to display the passing of time and

conveys relations among the different constituents through appropriate layout. Note that the method is suitable for an egocentric
perspective.
As the ﬁrst step of our approach, we integrate network analysis
methods [5, 10] with visualisation. In particular, we deﬁned the
new analysis methods such as (p,q)-core and 4-ring to identify important dense subgraphs and short cycles from the huge bipartite
graphs. We applied island analysis for a speciﬁc time slice in order
to identify important and meaningful subgraphs of the large and
complex network. Further, a temporal Kevin Bacon graph and a
temporal two mode network are extracted and visualised in order to
provide insight and knowledge on the evolution of the IMDB data
set.
This paper is organised as follows. In the next Section, we
present a simple analysis of the IMDB data set. In Section 3, we
present the integration of network analysis methods with visualisation for large bipartite graphs including (p,q)-core, 4-ring and island. Section 4 presents visual analysis based on the Kevin-Bacon
number. Section 5 presents galaxy metaphor visualisation of a temporal two mode actor-movie network, and a visual analysis of the
two mode network with company attributes. Section 6 concludes.

BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF IMDB

The source of the original data is the Internet Movie Database.
We transformed the contest data into a temporal network with
some additional vectors and partitions describing the properties
of vertices. The IMDB network is bipartite (two mode) and has
1324748 = 428440 + 896308 vertices and 3792390 arcs. 9927 of
the arcs in the network are multiple (parallel) arcs. The nature of
the appearance of multiple arcs can be seen in Figure 1, where all
arcs with multiplicity of at least 8 are displayed.
Note that in the analysis that follows, we treat multiple arcs as
single. The IMDB network consists of 132714 weak components.

V ISUALISATION AND A NALYSIS OF L ARGE B IPARTITE
N ETWORKS

There are few direct specialized methods for analyzing bipartite
networks, especially large ones. Because of the size of the IMDB
network, the standard reduction of the entire network to one or the
other derived 1-mode network was not an option. This motivated us
to design and implement two new methods for analysis of bipartite
networks:
• bipartite version of cores – (p, q)-cores

• 4-ring weights on lines
3.1 (p, q)-core Analysis
The subset of vertices C ⊆ V is a (p, q)-core in a bipartite (2-mode)
network N = (V1 ,V2 ; L), V = V1 ∪V2 if and only if
a. in the induced subnetwork K = (C1 ,C2 ; L(C)), C1 = C ∩ V1 ,
C2 = C ∩ V2 it holds ∀v ∈ C1 : degK (v) ≥ p and ∀v ∈ C2 :
degK (v) ≥ q ;
b. C is the maximal subset of V satisfying condition a.
The basic properties of bipartite cores are:
• C(0, 0) = V
• K(p, q) is not always connected
• (p1 ≤ p2 ) ∧ (q1 ≤ q2 ) ⇒ C(p1 , q1 ) ⊆ C(p2 , q2 )
Using (p, q)-cores, we can identify important dense structure out
of large and complex networks. We design a very efﬁcient O(m)
algorithm to ﬁne (p, q)-cores, and implement in Pajek .
Since there are many (p, q)-cores, we must answer the question
of how to select the interesting ones among them. To help the user
in these decisions, we implemented a Table of cores’ characteristics
n1 = |C1 (p, q)|, n2 = |C2 (p, q)| and k – number of components in
K(p, q) (see Table 1 and 2). We look for (p, q)-cores where
• n1 + n2 ≤ selected threshold
• big jumps from C(p − 1, q) and C(p, q − 1) to C(p, q).
For example, we selected (247,2)-core and (27,22)-core. From
the labels we can see that the corresponding topics are: wrestling,
and pornography. See Figures 2 and 3.
3.2 4-ring Analysis
A k-ring is a simple closed chain of length k. Using k-rings we can
deﬁne a weight of edges as wk (e) = # of different k-rings containing
the edge e ∈ E.
Since for a complete graph Kr , r ≥ k ≥ 3 we have wk (Kr ) =
(r − 2)!/(r − k)! the edges belonging to cliques have large weights.
Therefore, these weights can be used to identify the dense parts of
a network. For example, all r-cliques of a network belong to r − 2edge cut for the weight w3 .

Figure 3: (27,22)-core

The 3-ring weights were already available [8]. However, there
are no 3-rings in the IMDB network. The densest substructures
are complete bipartite subgraphs K p,q . They contain many 4-rings.
This motivated us to design a method to ﬁnd 4-rings weights. We
implement it in Pajek .

Figure 4: Charlie Brown

To identify interesting substructures, we applied the simple islands procedure for the weight w4 . It takes around three minutes to
compute w4 weights on a 1400 MHz, 1GB RAM computer, and 13
seconds to determine the islands. We obtained 12465 simple line
islands on 56086 vertices. Here is their size distribution.
There are 94 of size at least 30; and only 10 over 100. The
largest island corresponds to wrestling. Each island represents a
special topic. We visualized only some of them. For example, see
Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
3.3

Time slices and Island Analysis

By extracting a time slice from the complete network, we can identify the main groups in selected time periods. Islands can identify
important subgraphs of large networks based on the value of attributes [4].
To illustrate this, we extracted the time slice 1935-1950. There
are 223 simple islands [4] for w4 on 1774 vertices. For example,
we selected island 6 – ’Dona Macabra’; see Figure 9.

Erd¨os number of a mathematician; it represents the length of the
shortest path in the movie star collaboration network from the actor
to Kevin Bacon.
The data set was divided into time slices of a decade in length
(e.g. 1920s, 1930s, etc.), and the set of actors reduced in each
decade to only those who had co-starred in at least 5 ﬁlms with
another actor with a Kevin Bacon number of 1. The sizes of the
graphs for each of these time slices are given in Table 3.
The 1-mode co-starring networks of these reduced sets of actors
were constructed for each decade, and a three-dimensional layout
was generated for each using the Scale-free network layout [2]in
GEOMI [1]. Nodes in the force-directed layout were restricted to
lie on one of three concentric spheres, depending on the degree of
the node [2]. The colouring of each node was also used to indicate
the degree. The size of each node was dependant on the number of

movies in which the corresponding actor starred in that particular
decade. Similarly, the width of an edge was used to represent the
number of co-appearances between two actors in a decade.
To effectively illustrate the evolution of the co-starring network,
we display smooth animations between the layouts of subsequent
decades. The animations are broken into several parts shown one
after the other in time, in order to aid retention of the mental map.
First, nodes and edges not present in the ﬁrst layout are faded out.
Nodes present in both ﬁrst and second layouts are then animated to
their new positions in the second layout. Nodes new to the second
layout burst out from the centre and come to rest in their calculated positions, and ﬁnally new edges are faded in to show the new
collaborations in the second decade. The animation is downloadable from http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/∼dmerrick/gd05contest/gd05ﬁnal.avi

Table 3: Graph sizes per decade of co-starring network

This process was continued for all decade slices from 1911
through to 2004, and the result can be seen in the downloadable
animation. Figures 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 show snapshots of the animation from the 1960s through to the early 2000s.
The visualisation revealed a number of interesting facts. One unexpected ﬁnding was the substantial number of actors with a Kevin
Bacon number of 1 in the early years of the twentieth century, some
of whom could clearly not have co-starred in a ﬁlm with Kevin Bacon. This revealed some problems in the collection of the movie
data set. The years of some movies had been recorded incorrectly,
while edges to other movies that possessed the same name as a
movie of a prior decade were all recorded as belonging to the earlier
movie.
In the 1960s (Figure 10), the visualisation shows a clique involving the US president John F. Kennedy. This is due to the assassination of Kennedy in 1963, and the subsequent barrage of documentaries that were produced detailing the event. The other actors in the
clique (Jacqueline Kennedy, John and Nellie Connally, etc.) were
all present at the assassination. They are present in this data set
since the movie JFK, starring Kevin Bacon, included real archive
footage of the assassination. The Kennedys continue through to
later decades in the visualisation, illustrating the vast number of
documentary ﬁlms developed that were based on this event.
The 1970s, shown in Figure 11, sees the ﬁrst large connected
group of Hollywood actors that continue as big names to this day.
James Earl Jones, Robert Redford, Steve Martin and John Travolta
all appear in this group.

Figure 11: The co-starring actors visualisation (1970s)

The visualisation of the 1980s (Figure 12) highlights some particularly close-knit groups of actors. Comedy stars Chevy Chase,
Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray appear due to roles in Satuday Night
Live, Caddy Shack and Spies Like Us. Also present are Jim Cummings, Jack Angel and Rob Paulson, who have quite high degrees
due to their involvement as voice actors in many short cartoons and
episodes.
These groups continue into the 1990s, where the groups of actors
become much larger and more highly connected (Figure 13). More
well-established modern actors like Whoopi Goldberg, Tom Hanks
and Dennis Hopper become particularly prominent in this decade.
Finally, in the 2000s, we see some particularly interesting and
unexpected phenomena (Figure 14). First, music stars such as Britney Spears, Beyonc´e Knowles and Sheryl Crow appear with very
high degree and connectedness, due to their participation in numerous music award shows. Secondly, on the other side of the visualisation, popular actor Arnold Schwarzenegger links politicians to
the movie stars and musicians in the rest of the co-starring network.
This was primarily due to Schwarzenegger’s entry into politics, in

reduce visual complexity as follows.
We deﬁne the “stars” from the IMDB as follows:
• every star actor must have been in more than 12 movies over
the whole time period
• every star movie must have more than 12 actors
• each star actor must have played in between three to six
movies in each year

becoming the governor of the US state of California. Following
this event, he was in several political documentaries in which Bill
Clinton also appeared. Bill Clinton, in turn, is linked through documentaries and archival footage to other famous politicians, such as
Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.
A G ALAXY OF M OVIE S TARS OF T EMPORAL ACTOR M OVIE N ETWORK
This section describes a galaxy of movie stars of the temporal actormovie network with animation (in order to see the overview), and
a visualisation of the network of speciﬁc time slice (in order to see
the details).
First we consider a “galaxy of stars” metaphor of the movie-actor
network. The main idea is to map the “movie stars” in a movie
(i.e. animation) of a galaxy of stars which displays actor-movie
interactions.
Representing as much information as possible without introducing overwhelming visual complexity has always been a challenge
when visualising large data sets. We deﬁne important subgraphs to
5

22

We again use a bipartite (2-mode) network model. There are two
types of nodes: actor nodes and movie nodes. Actor nodes are displayed as stars in the night sky, and edges are displayed as faint
lines joining up “constellations” of actors (See Figure 15). Edges
with bends are displayed between actor and movie nodes; however,
movie nodes are hidden; in this manner, collaboration between actors can easily be seen. In this case, the picture not only reduces the
visual complexity (especially for edges), but also represents actormovie and actor-actor interactions at the same time.
To produce an overview of the temporal network dynamics, we computed a layout for each year from 1907 to 2004
and produced an animation. A two-dimensional force-directed
layout was generated for each year’s subgraph using GEOMI
[1]. The animation is performed between each layout, in a
similar manner to the animation of the co-starring authors network in the previous section. The animation is available from
http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/∼dmerrick/gd05contest/gd05-ﬁnal.avi
Once we have an overview of the temporal network using an
animation, we now focus on the details of the speciﬁc year of the
network to observe some interesting patterns in speciﬁc time periods.
Figure 16 shows part of the layout of year 1918. Those three
actors co-starred in ﬁve movies together; on the other hand, they did
not appear in any other movies. Only one of the movies includes
actors from outside. This kind of pattern can be usually found in
the early years.
Figures 17 and 18 show a different pattern. They are both captured from the layout of year 1983. In Figure 17, nineteen actors
co-starred in a masterpiece. In Figure 18, the same group of people starred in a series of movies together, whilst also appearing in
other movies with actors from outside the group. Compared to the
pattern of early years in Figure 16, one may gain some knowledge
and insight about the trends of the movie industry from Figure 17.

Figure 16: Actor collaboration pattern in early years.

Further insights can be discovered when combining company attributes in visualisation, Figures 19 to 22 show. There are two clusters in 1985. To assist with analysis, we display the movie nodes
with their labels. The two clusters are normal movies and adult
movies.
Figures 19 to 22 show some patterns in the evolution: before the
1990s, these two types of movies were clearly separated, meaning
that they were produced by different companies with different actors. That is, two groups seldom collaborated. However, these two
groups started to merge into one big group. The actors started to
move around between different companies for collaboration. For
example, see the year 1994. It is difﬁcult to separate these two
groups in the picture. This may be an indication of the possible
change in the movie industry, as well as to the social network of actors. This visualisation can be a useful supplement to formal analysis methods.
6 C ONCLUSION
Integration of good analysis methods with proper visualisation
methods is an effective approach to gain an insight into large and
complex networks. Our next step is to further integrate various
analysis methods with visualisation on different data sets. A formal evaluation on the insights and knowledge derived then needs to
be carried out.

Ultimately, appropriate interaction methods need to be integrated
in order to complete our visual analysis framework for large and
complex networks.
