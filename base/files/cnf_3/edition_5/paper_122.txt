Abstract
From phantom haptic devices, 3D mouse
to multimodal interfaces, while the academics contend
about the similarities and differences in theoretical
approaches and understanding of the next generation of
interfaces in the pursuit of formulating research
directions; researchers are actively pursuing the
emergence of the next generation of human-computer
interaction predictions, discussing emerging new
interaction styles and interface designs; few or almost
none has discussed the exquisite offerings, the use and
merits of using simply the age old two-button
mechanical mouse in the artistic interactive taxonomy.
This paper presents an exclusive range of
results created by the autonomous, ubiquitous and
pervasive handheld interaction of the mechanical mouse.
It discusses the tangible interfaces -- lightweight, tacit,
passive, perceptual and non-command line interaction
interface. The core of this framework is founded of an
event-based dab-and-scribe, press-and-release dexterity
in a discrete or continuous process as an user interface
widget. It eliminates the necessity of extra input layers,
offers instant visualization and demonstrates the
embodied interfaces of this handheld device technology.
This approach and practice establishes that such
handheld device is an indispensable tool that offers endto-end solution from instant conceptualization to
visualization thus bridging the gap between desire,
creative thinking and realization that reigns.
The author, creator of an extensive
repertoire of NPR images, compares the sensitivity of
this wired two-button mechanical roller ball mouse
versus a high precision laser mouse while she profiles the
futility of the wireless self-powered optical mouse as
well as the pen tablet.

Introduction

Image editing software is often
characterized by a seemingly endless array of toolbars,

filters, transformations, special effects and layers. By
using a mouse, even more disagreeable, a wired 38-year
old two-button mechanical mouse as an authoring tool to
create an image is definitely deem as counter productive
and seen as a counter trend. Nevertheless, this paper
reveals the artistic merits of what a common desktop
human computer interface -- a steady handheld control
mechanism is capable of achieving within the controlled
space of a surface such as a mouse-pad without the
glamor of using a whole slew of NPR tools. In fact, this
approach completely eliminates stroke stylization,
control point manipulation, texture synthesis, layering,
grids and rules, in fact just to sketch, draw or paint. By
means of this pointing device, the author allows such
complex operations to be reduced to simply exercising
brush strokes with minimal user interaction. This humandevice interaction is platform-transparent and softwareindependent.

Image Editing Methodologies

Despite of the notable amount of papers on
non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) that have been
published [1], [2], [3], [4] and the plethora nonphotorealistic effects that are available, there is a lack of
understanding of the primitives: the notion and motion of
sketch, draw, paint and creating so-called “effects”. With
the exception of the provision of manipulating control
points and rigid technical drawings used by an illustrator,
using an algorithm and modeling approach to create a
sketch [5] or a painting is simply too artificial to be
spontaneously used by an artist. While the structured
approach with artificial means simulates, not only it does
not stimulate, it dilutes the fluidity of the painterly.
Nevertheless, the ingenuity of these algorithms lies not in
the natural “instinct” of the human hand and its handheld
device, but rather on the modeling of stroke stylization
[6], [7] and object geometry, generating texture atlas [8]
and area- or curvature-based surface mapping.

2.2

Stroke Manipulation

The overall activity of a stroke is engulfed
in the all-encompassing field of the depth-of-paint which
mediates between the entirety of the painted field and the

desired revealed surface support beneath it. Be it glossy,
matte, or dull, such depth-of-paint varied immensely in
the viscosity and finish of the paint through the
multifarious methods of painting and style. These many
paint qualities are largely achieved with the interaction
between the dab of paint and the surface through the x-yz body-arm-hand maneuver and control of the handheld
device, namely, a real world or virtual brush.
Conventionally, as long as the artist can articulate this
desired paint stroke and is able to translate it into a
colored textured discrete or continuous line, area or
volume at a defined paint viscosity, pressure and throwdistance onto a defined surface at x-y-z position, it is
considered as a stroke expressed. Editing a completed
stroke is considered as unsolicited and unskillful,
sometimes it is even reckon as detrimental in the case of
Oriental calligraphy and paintings. As such, it is possible
to replace the real world brushes by a two-button
mechanical mouse with basic brush configuration and
settings to create a great variety of 2D sketches, drawings
and paintings [9] (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4).

In contrast with the raster graphics way of
sketching, drawing and painting, a vector graphics image
can be stored as a collection of in individual lines, curves
and geometric shapes. The classic draw objects are
constructed from basic primitives and Bézier curves, for
example, whereby objects retain their own separate
identity so they can be manipulated independently of
each other to create, edit and display computational
object-oriented vector drawings [10]. Apart from Grid
Geometry Art Construction [11], this method is usually
deployed to create technical [12] precision drawings and
illustrations which require crisp lines, graphic details and
accurate typographic work. However, using control
points manipulation to change shape [13] or form and
generate sequences could be useful.

Control Points Manipulation

Texture Mappings

Using automatic texture atlas with even
texture distribution across a surface [14], [15] is a texture
mapping method albeit definitely unsuitable for NPR
abstract Western paintings (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8), as
painting is an intuitive process. Applying a LEM-based
(Local Equilibrium Model) approach for Oriental
paintings [16], though viable, is unnecessary [17]
(Figures 4, 10).

Be it 2D or 3D, there are just as many
offerings for generating NPR images sequences for
cartoon animation [18], [20]. An example would be
providing visual feedback, varying the cartoonist’s input
and linking them to modifiers [21]. Though this may be
an idea, it may not be required as demonstrated in
Figures 5 to 8 -- examples of some 2,000 frames for an
animation created by the author with a mechanical
mouse.

Images for Animation

NPR for 3D objects

A more recent method was to draw direct
onto a virtual table top by using SmartSketches for 3D
design and modeling [21]. which could well be useful as
and when the method is refined over time. However, a
draw direct method [22], [23] is more effective when
creating 3D objects such as cartoons and sculptures
(Figures 9, 11, 12). Though texture mappings are widely
in rendering 3D objects, a draw or paint direct method is
preferred by the author.

Handheld Devices

Many believe that in conjunction with an
image editing software, there is a need to deploy CG
assisted hardware tools to assist the interaction between
the human hand and the computer to sketch, draw or
paint to realize their imaging ideas, thus the common
deployment of a LCD digitizer or pen table [24]. In
addition, there are just as many who has discarded the
two-button mechanical roller ball mouse for the wireless
self-powered optical mouse, one that weighs down the
artist’s arm and hand movement during the process and
hence obstructs and impedes the creation process. A
possible and better substitute is a light weight and high
speed 2000 dpi laser mouse.

Future Works

As further development of NPR interfaces
and systems are being pursued, the author is taking a
dissimilar path by actively developing and expanding the
potential of her preferred handheld device, to avoid and
eliminate using an additional artificial software or
hardware layer interfacing the device and the draw
surface. The aim is to concentrate on the biodynamics of
this handheld device and shortened the creation time of
successive frames for toon animation as well as creating
even more sensuous NPR images.
