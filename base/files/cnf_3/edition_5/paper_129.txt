ABSTRACT

instrument:

Consider mobility and flexibility to be part of musical
instrument design architecture and playing the instrument as a
choreography with 3D installation. I-Musika:MIME (Mobile
Interface Musical Expression) is a multidimensional interface
that seeks to integrate at least three “disjoint neighborhoods” or
entities: “keys, instruments and players”. Based on the frequency
resonating structures modeling paradigm, I-Musika:MIME
transfigures the properties and geometry of musical instrument
and unifies the excitation methods for different instruments, thus
offering multiple (distinct) designs for a single instrument or a
single design for multiple (distinct) instruments via an interface
that provides contact free playing. As such, not only it transforms
the keys-instruments-players relationship and creates new
performing style that is insensitive to posture, hand and finger
positioning, it creates a new audience-player-instrument profile.
Harnessing the properties of this interface, I-Musika:MIME, the
new instrument is portable with an artistic physical appearance or
visual representation as desired. It can be modified and achieved
as you pleased to add another dimension to musical pleasure.

Introduction

Unlike the conventional acoustic musical instruments,
electronic synthesizers, interactive screen-based or sensor- or
gesture-based musical instruments, the proposed I-Musika:
MIME (Mobile Interactive Musical Expression) musical
instrument [1] creates a new line of artistic exploration and
communication between the player and the audience. I-Musika:
MIME is a body of frequency sensitive device-to-device
communication [2] mobile media artworks, whereby the physical
appearance or visual representation of these musical instruments,
in part or in total, can be modified and achieved as and when
desired. Beyond which, the new interface of this musical

This paper presents the deployment of the frequency
sensitive technology in the creation of MIME-based I-Musika
musical instrument that represents direct peer-to-peer
communication between player and mobile devices, it is also
conceived in the conception of an interactive 3D art installation.
While sound is rendered based on the interaction of these
devices, musical instrument usage and musician's activities can
also be trailed, traced and recorded automatically. I-Musika:MIME has
established a connection across and coherence between spaces to
create controllable multiplicity of independent or collaborative
musical performances that takes musical dynamics to a noble
footing.

Conceptual Communication Paradigm

Based on a specified carrier frequency, I-Musika:MIME
deploys a contactless ISO compliant interface whereby a music
note is played by transferring energy and data and hence the
generated magnetic field, from the player's hand held device to
the mobile device - the respective music note. Each mobile
device can denote a key of this musical instrument or even an
entire instrument. By means of binary modulation, it offers the
possibility of transferring energy from the mobile device to the
hand held device used by the player. As such, this device-todevice communication establishes an interesting two-way
communication between the player and the musical instrument.
The whole concept is an articulation of the following
representation:
O = Orchestra

However, an authorized person or a player can move the
keys around before or even during the performance, according to a
selected music score. As such, keys for different instruments can be
arranged in any order, this means, keys per similar or dissimilar
instrument may not need to be separately clustered, albeit this is not
recommended as it may prove to be confusing for a player.
Nevertheless, color and material type can be deployed to distinguish
the keys of different instrument type.

As compared to acoustic musical instruments, except
for extreme operating conditions, I-Musika:MIME keys are largely
humidity and temperature insensitive, and hence eliminated the need
of constant tunning under normal operating condition. The pitch of a
key can be tunned either by software or hardware, nevertheless, this
is seldom required as once it has been fixed at the onset, it does not
result in microtonal differences due to environmental condition
changes or material wear and tear.
A
s any key of any instrument is reconfigurable dynamically,
scales, études or fingering exercises are redefined to be hand
movement exercises.

I = Instruments

The Keys

The keys of I-Musika is a collection of 3D sculptural
pieces, in any material, color, shape, figurative or abstract, size, for
an instrument -- a synthesis of art and sound or music. While the
definition and properties of sound remain unchanged, the attributes
of the keys of musical instruments take different shades of meaning,
thus altering the semantics of musical performances. As these keys
are not tethered to any location and are orientation insensitive, they
can be displayed on any surface, such as a table or pedestal, ceiling
or wall mount in any direction. For easy recognition, they can be
shaped in abstract alphabets and alluded to a logical and
transcendental location according to the concept of a 12-tone5) equal
temperament arrangement. An example:

C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B

intensity

–

articulation

–

timbre [5]

–

rhythm (succession of events in time)

Each of these parameters is individually controlled and it varies
accordingly, depending on whether it is a acoustic or
electroacoustic-based musical instrument or it is a screen-based
digital musical instrument as shown below:

While instrumentalists rely on tactile and/or visual feedbacks [6] as
well as sonic information, the intent of I-Musika:MIME is to
eliminate these feedbacks and explore a new performance experience.

The Playing Method

The instrument uses a non-directional hand held pointing
device within a 3 cm distance, to one of the sculptures to capture the
intended music note.

selected key of an instrument, as a player can move the hand held
device or pointing device to any desired key to play the desired note
or passage or melody; alternatively, this pointing device can be
anchored, and the player brings a key to the pointing device. This
non-direction sensitive high degree of mobility, can be seen as a
strength in many movement-based application [7], as it has
completely eliminated the tethering phenomenon. As such, it implies
that there can be multiple players playing the same or different
instruments concurrently without interference or instruments
collisions. Another possibility being the player's individual
movement can be coordinated inline with the music score for a
simple tune, or the arrangement of the sculpture, for the more
aesthetically inclined.
As sound is created by a source, the emitter (sender) and
the receptor (receiver) as the consequence of the communication
between two objects: a playing object and a played object. As the
player reads the manuscript music score or improvised a passage, his
visual feedback enables the “Hand” (see Fig 2), that serves as a
proximity contact function, to reach out to “play” the “note”, hence
activate and attain the sound of that note. Unlike the acoustic musical
instruments, I-Musika:MIME is not a gesture-based instrument [8],
player plays without posture, hand and fingering positing.
Playing I-Musika:MIME cultivates ambidexterity, that is, it makes
no distinction between Left or Right Hand playing. Beyond which,
like the screen-based virtual instruments, the pitch of the instrument
has been preset by hardware and/or software at the outset, as well as
the method of playing, such as bowing, plucking, blowing or beating
techniques are completely eliminated, hence the player's proficiency,
tactile feedback [9] is not a factor influencing the correctness of
pitch neither does it determine the quality of the tone generated. As
such, the non posture-cum-hand-finger-based I-Musika:MIME
portrays a new player's profile and a new relationship between
players, instruments and keys are established as follows:

Technical Specification

4.1

Hardware Design

I-Musika:MIME consists of an entry-level, lightweight
personal computer with two reasonably good speakers and a custommade hand held pointing device. After the setup, it does not require
any screen monitor, keyboard and the mouse to activate this musical
instrument. The Send and Receive signals function is triggered by a
connected USB-enabled hand held pointing device (see Fig 2) to the
custom made sensor [10] embedded keys of the I-Musika:MIME
based musical instrument. The system supports any number of keys,
of any shape, size and color for any instrument.

4.2

Software design

I-Musika:MIME is implemented on Linux Version 2.6.17
kernel with a sound data base power up by the Fourier Series
dependent Application System (FAST) for send and receive signals
as well as modulating frequency for any instrument now known or to
be created. The software which is designed to calibrate the pitch and
timbre of the instrument is also capable of controlling the duration of
a note and/or tempo of a work. Beyond which, the system handles
any selected even or uneven temperament of the instrument
depending on the choice of the number of keys for that instrument.

5.

Conclusions

As I-Musika:MIME is an unprecedented musical
instrument created from a blank sheet, performer's experience is not
immediately transparent. As it is a musical instrument embedding
technology in aesthetics, it seeks greater understanding in the pursuit
of interdisciplinary studies. As it is a new instrument, audience and
audience-performer's experience cannot be measured at this moment,
albeit it offers a tangible pleasant experience. As it creates a new
conceptual paradigm and direction in instrument design as it
advances with science and technology. From acoustic musical
instrument to electronic synthesizer to virtual instruments, this
paradigm shift is an experience learned whereby musical instruments
can be built in any dimension based on frequency,, amplitude and
Fourier Transform alone. In so doing, one can then achieve freshness
and continue to strive for building the next generation instruments.

6.

Future Works

Immediate future works for I-Musika:MIME is to refine
frequency modulation for a great repertoire of instruments for
achieving high timbre quality. The successful introduction of
I-Musika:MIME based musical instruments also suggests the
possibilities of staging a concert and/or installing a large-scale artfilled I-Musika:MIME musical instruments in an art museum so to
realize different performing experiences.
