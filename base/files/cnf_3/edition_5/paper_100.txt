Abstract
The evaluation of Information Visualization (InfoVis)
techniques can help to identify specific strengths and weaknesses of these methods. The following article describes the
results of an empirical study assessing the contribution of
an interactive InfoVis method based on a spring metaphor
(GRAVI), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine
Learning (ML) to ease understanding. The application domain is the psychotherapeutic treatment of anorectic young
women. The three methods are supposed to support the
therapists in finding the variables which influence success
or failure of the therapy. To conduct the evaluation we developed a report system which helped subjects to formulate
and document in a self-directed manner the insights they
gained when using the three methods. The results indicate
that the three methods are complementary and should be
used in conjunction.

Introduction

Several authors have pointed out the importance of evaluation studies of Information Visualization (InfoVis) techniques (see e.g. [1, 2, 8, 17]). In the past few years usability studies concerning visualization methods have become more frequent, and valuable information about the
design of such systems has been gathered. Nevertheless,
as Spence [15] mentions, there is still too little systematic
information about the specific strengths and weaknesses of
the features of InfoVis techniques. On the basis of existing
evidence it is still difficult to decide which InfoVis technique to use for which purpose. Therefore, evaluation stud-

ies are especially important to give the developers some insights into the usefulness of a given InfoVis technique for
the intended area of application.
The following study describes an investigation in how
best to support psychotherapists in their work. The aim of
these therapists is to analyze the development of anorectic
young women taking part in a psychotherapy. During this
process a large amount of highly complex data is collected.
Statistical methods are not suitable to analyze these data because of the small sample size, the high number of variables
and the time-dependent character of the data. Only a small
number of anorectic young women attend a therapy at one
time. The young women and their parents have to fill in numerous questionnaires before, during and after the therapy.
In addition, progress in therapy is often not a linear process
but a development with ups and downs. All of this indicates
that InfoVis techniques might be a better method of analysis of these data. The aim of the therapists is to predict
success or failure of the therapy depending on the results
of the questionnaires, and, more generally, to analyze the
factors influencing anorexia nervosa in more detail.
We tested three possibilities how to support the therapists’ work: an InfoVis technique specifically developed
for this purpose, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML). The InfoVis technique which is called
Gravi++ (GRAVI, for legibility) was developed in cooperation with the psychotherapists and reflects their requirements. EDA seems to be an interesting alternative because
of its exploratory nature. Machine Learning might also
yield interesting results because of its computational power.
These three methods were compared, and the results of this
comparison are described in the following text. Our original assumption was not that one of these techniques might
be the best but rather to find the specific strengths and weaknesses of these methods and how these methods could best

be combined.
The investigation of the InfoVis technique GRAVI was
conducted in two stages. We distinguished between the usability study (which was conducted first) and a study of the
technique as such. It is well-known that a good InfoVis
technique might be rejected because of usability problems
of the concrete implementation. Therefore, we solved the
usability problems of the software first (see [11]). A similar
approach was adopted by North [4]. In the second phase
we assessed the three techniques mentioned above. Main
results gained in the second phase of the investigation will
be reported below.

Related Work

GRAVI is based on a spring metaphor. Icons for the
questions from the questionnaires are positioned on a circle.
Other icons for the anorectic young women are arranged
within this circle depending on the strength of attraction of
the single questions. The questions function, to a certain
extent, like magnets or springs. The final position of an
icon for the anorectic young women is a combination of the
forces of all questions (see Figure 1). Similar InfoVis techniques have already been developed (see e.g. [6]). There
is also some recent literature describing empirical investigations of similar techniques (see [20, 7]). Although there
is some similarity of GRAVI to these techniques, there are
also noticeable differences. GRAVI has very specific features for interaction with the system. It is possible to visualize dynamic, time-dependent data. It also combines a
visualization based on a spring metaphor with other visualization methods (e.g. a star glyph).
It is mentioned by Yi, et al. [20] that the spring metaphor
makes it easy to understand their visualization technique.
They describe occlusion as one of their biggest problems.
This is also an issue with GRAVI, although we found a possible solution for this problem. Yi, et al. [20] also point out
that such visualization techniques might not be appropriate
for people who cannot formulate questions. This is no problem for GRAVI because the target population (psychotherapists) are professionals in their field. Pillat, et al. [7] posit
that each visualization technique has different advantages.
They found out that the identification of clusters and the
visualization of general features of the dataset are the advantages of visualization techniques based on the spring
metaphor.

2.1

of these techniques are not straightforward. Many evaluations of InfoVis techniques use task completion times and
error rates as the only variables tested. In an ill-structured
domain with no clear-cut results like psychotherapy other
approaches are necessary. In such a domain it is often difficult to decide whether a result is “true” or “false”. The
definition of mental health in psychotherapy, e.g., is highly
controversial. Furthermore, getting valid insights will take
up a lot of time and efficiency in a traditional sense is not an
issue. Therefore Saraiya, et al. [14] suggest “insight” as an
outcome variable. We found this approach also very valuable. So far, there are no general frameworks for categorizing insights. So we developed our own classification system
which is highly dependent on the tasks our subjects had to
solve. Nevertheless, we think that it should be possible to
develop a more generic framework for insight classification
because it seems to be plausible that insights like clustering
or finding detailed, factual information will be necessary
for many exploratory InfoVis techniques. This is certainly
an area for future research.

GRAVI

Users can interact with GRAVI [3] in several ways. The
most basic form of interactivity is positioning icons on the
screen. These represent the patients and questionnaires they
answered. According to the answer a patient gave to a question, the patient’s icon is attracted by the question’s icon.
This leads to the formation of clusters of patients who gave
similar answers (see Figure 1). The therapists are especially
interested in those variables which predict the outcome of
the therapy (successful or not successful). By analyzing
clusters of “positive” and “negative” cases they can identify those variables.
GRAVI can also represent dynamic, time dependent
data. It uses animation and traces to show the paths of the
patients’ icons over all time steps. The position of the patients’ icons change over time. This allows analyzing and
comparing the changing values. The therapists need this

Stasko [16] points out that the evaluation of information
visualizations is a challenging task, especially if the goals

feature to visualize information recorded at different points
in time. The development in time is a very important aspect
of the analysis of the progress of the therapy. In addition
to the spring based visualization GRAVI also offers other
methods, e.g. Star Glyphs to communicate the exact values
of each answer (see Figure 2).
GRAVI provides various interaction possibilities to explore the data and generate new insights. The icons and
visual elements can be moved, deleted, highlighted and emphasized by the user. Each change leads to an instant update of the visualization. For more details on visualization
options, user interactions, and implementation see [3].

Other Techniques (EDA, ML)

We investigated the InfoVis technique and other methods used so far like EDA (in this case boxplots, histograms,
scatterplots, and statistical measures). Machine Learning
algorithms was the other choice as it might be able to reveal
structures in the complex data. The ML algorithms are: a
C4.5 decision tree and a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
trained by Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was developed by
Tukey [18] and is based on statistics. It helps users to review
and analyze data on a descriptive level. Tukey thought that
the emphasis on statistical testing might be too narrow an
approach. He, therefore, suggested EDA as a possibility to
formulate hypotheses and assess assumptions. Subjects in
our tests were given printouts of these methods (e.g., Fig. 3).
Machine Learning is an area of AI concerned with the
development of algorithms that enable computers to ’learn’.
A Machine Learning method learns from observed examples or data. In general, there are two types of machine
learning algorithms: supervised and unsupervised. In case

of supervised learning, a priori knowledge about the data is
used and in case of unsupervised learning, no prior information is given regarding the data or the output. We utilized two supervised schemes using WEKA [19]: a Support
Vector Machine with Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm [9] and a pruned C4.5 decision tree [10]. The output of these two methods were available to the subjects as
handouts on paper (e.g., Fig. 4).
Such algorithms allow users to detect significant patterns
in complex data sets. Decision trees, e.g., can be used as a
decision support tool to identify possible outcomes of various strategies.

General Study Design

As mentioned above, usability issues in a narrow sense
were not addressed in the study described here. The aim
of the study was rather to find out whether meaningful insights can be found by using various analytical methodologies (GRAVI, EDA, ML), with the emphasis being on
the analysis of GRAVI, and whether these methodologies
can be used meaningfully for solving the psychotherapists’
problems. For the importance of different evaluation stages
and appropriate evaluation methods see [12].
It is well known that real users should be used for the
evaluation of InfoVis techniques (see e.g. [8]). Nevertheless, there are situations when this is not possible. We cooperate with two psychotherapists with marked time constraints. Extensive testing is, therefore, not possible with
our project partners. So, we decided to use computer science students as subjects. The sample size was 32. The

The major goals of this study is to answer the following questions: What are the types of insights gained with
the different tools? Can the tools be used together to maximize the comprehension of the data? What are the specific
strengths and weaknesses of the three methods?

Qualitative information about exploratory processes of
InfoVis techniques is often gained by using thinking aloud
techniques. This is very time-consuming and allows only
a restricted sample size. We, therefore, developed a report
system allowing subjects to document their insights. The
subjects used this system to document their findings during
the exploration process. It is accessible with any conventional web browser and is implemented in Perl and MySQL.
The following data is collected: used material, description
of finding, and confidence rating.

students got a one-hour introduction into the subject area
and another similar one into the methods used. The actual
testing took place in a laboratory at our university and lasted
3 hours (approx. one hour for each method). The tasks the
subjects had to solve were exploratory in nature. The psychotherapists are especially interested in the variables influencing success or failure of the therapy (= predictors). Such
factors might be e.g. social phobia, depression or lack of
social contacts (derived from the questionnaires). The tasks
were formulated in the form of scenarios: two specifying
meaningful subsets of data to explore (questions, patients,
time steps) and two more stating concrete questions additionally. The intended types of investigations can be characterized as follows: (1) realize the change over time of
16 patients in 5 dimensions and identify positive and negative predictors (e.g. all patients whose depression scores
do not decrease in the middle of the therapy are likely to
have a negative therapy outcome), (2) recognize the consistent/inconsistent answers of parents and patients in the first

Used Material

For the three different methods used by the subjects three
different report forms were developed. In the case of EDA
subjects can specify via checkboxes whether scatterplots,
boxplots, histograms, or statistical measures were used. For
ML the options are SMO or J48.
If GRAVI is used, screenshots are possible to document the state of the visualization at the time an insight
occurs. Of course, an exploration process sometimes last
several minutes before a meaningful documentation is possible. Also, there often is not the one and only screenshot
if the documentation deals with changes over time. In all
these cases the subjects were told to upload a representative
screenshot.

6.2

Documented Findings

An input field is provided for documentation of findings
in natural language. There is no limitation in length. The
subjects were requested to fill out a new report for every
insight they may have. Here is an example of such an insight
(taken from study; translated into English):
“Patients with a negative therapy outcome have
little self-confidence, which even continues to
worsen [over time in therapy] and which is accompanied generally with an increasing depression.”

6.3

Confidence Rating

With each documentation there has to be a confidence
rating on a three-step scale: low, medium, and high. Without this rating the report cannot be saved.

7

Classification System

To compare the three methods it is necessary to define
several relevant variables. These variables form a classification system. Some of the variables are more generic
(complexity, plausibility, argument) and similar to evaluation characteristics suggested by North [5]. Others are more
task specific as for example the identification of a predictor,
an activity which was defined by the therapists as essential
for the analysis. The classification was performed by three
persons to ensure the reliability of the results.

7.1

Assigned Insights

We decided to split long reports into several in basic insights instead of dealing with them as unique occurrences of
one complex insights. Long Reports are sometimes simply
a cumulative documentation from a subject who did not adhere to the test procedure of reporting insights immediately.
By doing so we can ensure comparability.
The classification system was developed bottom up but
with the relevant literature in mind. Of course, we designed
the scenarios which defined meaningful subsets of the data
in close cooperation with our domain experts and also asked
them for an extensive list of possible insights. But it is impossible to anticipate all valid documentations. So we compiled a preliminary list of insight categories after a first review of a few tens of reports. This list was then adjusted
repeatedly to cover the documented findings. Every extension or consolidation was discussed thoroughly among researchers. This procedure resulted in thirteen main insight
categories (see Table 1).
In terms of a hierarchical naming scheme every insight
was uniquely identified. For instance, to the main prefix
“data” we added more detailed specifications as needed in
the process of insight classification. This resulted in 10
sub categories of “data” insights (e.g., reading off scores
for individual patients, comparing identical scores, reading
off scores for patient groups). A carefully designed hierarchy allows for summarizing for instance all data observations where the cognitive performance is the comparison of
groups of patients.

7.2

Complexity

The complexity of each insight was rated on a three-step
scale: low, medium, and high. This rating was influenced by

the following factors: the domain value (e.g. the identification of a predictor is much more interesting than the recognition of missing data of a patient in various time steps);
whether the observation deals with only one time step or
with the change over time; the number of patients the insight deals with. And of course, we tried to ensure the relation within the different complexity ratings.

7.3

Plausibility

It is sometimes a difficult task to rate the correctness of
an insight assigned to a report in a range of true and false.
Instead it is often more a question of plausibility. Especially, by using three notably different methods to explore
the data, the subjects sometimes even documented contradictory insights all of which seem plausible with the used
method. This classification takes place on a three-step scale:
not plausible, moderately plausible, very plausible.

7.4

Argument

This category reflects the depth of the description of insights. Here we take into account the fact that the different methods may facilitate or hinder elaboration of findings.
Once more, a three-step scale is used: absurd argument, no
argument, meaningful argument.

7.5

Auxiliary Variables

We used different checkboxes to keep track of the classification status of every report which had to be proofread

by at least a ’second set of eyes’. A third pass was required
for final classified status. There exist also various to-discuss
flags (e.g. between investigators, with domain experts).

Results and Discussion

32 subjects documented an overall of 876 reports in sessions of 155 minutes. The number of reports and assigned
insights for the three methods is shown in Table 2. An average of 2.47 insights were assigned to a report.

Pearson’s χ test shows significant difference in the

(χ2 = 39.149, df = 2, p = 3.153e−09).
Once again, by analyzing the whole of Table 2, we find
significant divergency regarding reports and insights. It
happens that there are fewer reports generated while using GRAVI and at the same time more insights gained with
GRAVI than expected (χ2 = 10.5003, df = 2, p =
0.005247).

Obviously, the numbers of insights of the thirteen main
categories in Table 3 differ significantly for the three used
methods (χ2 = 857.7601, df = 24, p < 2.2e−16).
It is obvious that both decision tree J48/C4.5 and
SVM/SMO formula of ML cannot communicate individual scores of patients in most cases (’data’) (see Tab. 3).
Finding individual data also seems to be slightly difficult
with GRAVI. Clusters of patients could only be found by
GRAVI, although this should be, in principle, also possible
with EDA. Most errors were made using ML (this method
was found to be the most difficult by subjects). ’Eval’ and
’coeff’ were categories specific for ML. ’Meta’ describes
the formulation of hypotheses going beyond the data given.
We have no explanation for the fact why this category does
not appear with GRAVI. A very interesting result is that
subjects found significantly less predictors with ML than
with EDA and GRAVI. This probably also has something
to do with the fact that ML seems to be the most difficult
methodology.

Returning to numbers of reports, Table 4 shows how

tasks. Surprisingly, we cannot discard the null hypothesis
(χ2 = 8.3186, df = 6, p = 0.2157). There is no systematic relationship between scenarios and methods used.

But if we analyze the number of assigned insights (see
Table 5) instead of the number of reports, we face once
more significant difference (χ2 = 50.8084, df = 6, p =
3.236e−09). The underrepresentation of insights for scenario A (first task) with the use of ML and at the same time
an overrepresentation of insights for scenario B / question

2 (second and fourth task) may be due to the need for an
extensive familiarization phase with this method. The same
precaution is advisable in interpreting possible reasons for
underrepresentation of insights gained with the use of EDA
in scenario B, because scatterplots should have provided
good material for exploring the given problem area.

The subject had to state with every report what their

Unmistakably the reason for significant difference (χ2 =

confidence ratings with GRAVI. This fact has to be studied

arguments with EDA and more wrong arguments with ML
than expected.

Outlook and Future Work

As outlined above, the presented work is part of a extensive evaluation of GRAVI on multiple levels. On the
level of InfoVis technique evaluation there are further questions to be investigated: Is there a relevance of the order in
which the three groups of subjects used the three methods
(i.e. MEG, EGM, GME)? Will a cluster analysis of the subjects reveal different interaction strategies with Gravi++ and
strengths and weaknesses in having particular types of insights? Is there a significant amount of unbalanced insights
like those with high confidence ratings but low plausibility
and vice versa?
On a methodological level interesting questions arise, for
instance is there a correlation between length of documentations, number of assigned insights to this report, and argument classifications?
Log Files: All sessions with GRAVI of the 32 subjects
(65 minutes each) have been recorded and resulted in log
files with more than 50000 entries. A simple parser to be
written in Perl will do the job enumerating the different interactions, etc. Log file chunks between later insights will
probably not reflect much of the exploratory interactions
leading to these insights, because an existing learning curve
would not be accounted for. But the analysis of the log files
on a subject-level will probably help to identify different
interaction strategies.
Case Study: After participatory design, development,
and extensive usage of GRAVI qualitative interviews with
the psychotherapists will reveal to what extent the visualization has proven itself useful for their daily work.

Conclusion
The comparison of the three analytical methods (GRAVI,
EDA, ML) indicates that these methods have different
strength and weaknesses. From the results reported in this
study one might conclude that ML is not a recommendable
methodology. The subjects’ confidence ratings were low,
the complexity of the gained insights was low and few predictors were found. Nevertheless, we know from a focus
group study described elsewhere [13] that subjects thought
ML to be a trustworthy and interesting method for experts.
GRAVI and EDA seem to complement each other very well.
EDA methods are well know and easy to understand. Therefore, they support exploration well (they generated most reports and insights). They are especially suited to analyze
single values. GRAVI, on the other hand, works well for
the generation of complex insights. Both GRAVI and EDA
enabled subjects to find many predictors.
All in all a combined usage of the three methods is indicated because of their different strengths and weaknesses.
Any obvious (or maybe superficial) benefits and limitations
of the different methods should not lead to an exclusive use
of one technique. Used in conjunction all three methods
will very likely contribute to a deeper comprehension of the
data to explore.
