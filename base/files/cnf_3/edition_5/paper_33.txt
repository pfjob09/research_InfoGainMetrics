Abstract
In this study, we crawled a local Web domain, created
its graph representation, and analyzed the network structure. The results of network analysis revealed local scalefree patterns consistent with previous research on the Web.
To discover topical communities of the local domain, linkbased co-citation analysis was performed to measure pairwise similarities. Based on the co-citation graph, a visualization was produced to map the networked domain semantically. All of this offers a way to investigate a local Web
structure and to make it more intuitively understandable.

1 Introduction
Previous research has found that the World Wide Web
is a scale-free network [1] [2] [4]. It resembles a bow-tie
structure and is comprised of four components: the Central Core, IN, OUT, and tendrils and tubes [7]. Relying on
statistical analysis, these research provide insights to understanding the global Web. Nonetheless, to individual and/or
organizational interests, it is also valuable to explore a local
Web’s structure.
Instead of statistically claiming a Web structure such as
a bow-tie, information visualization might be more intuitive
in revealing a local topology based on semantic similarities.
According to Menczer, the Web has two main classes of
cues to approximate semantic similarity: lexical cues (textual content) and link cues (hyperlinks) [10]. Text-based
representation and similarity measures have been widely
studied in information retrieval research [3]. For example, the TF-IDF (term frequency * inverse document frequency) weighting scheme and the Cosine ranking metric
are known to be effective in measuring relevance. However,
given the huge number of pages on the Web, it is computationally expensive to measure pairwise textual similarities.
Link analysis is more affordable.

In this study, we are primarily interested in applying network analysis and visualization techniques to local Web domains. We wish to know whether the characteristics of the
global Web are applicable locally, that is within an organizational domain. Specifically, this study is to provide an
exemplary approach to analyzing network properties, identifying topical communities, and visualizing the map of a
local domain.

2 Crawling the Local Domain
We restricted ourselves to our own local university domain, namely *.indiana.edu. To retrieve the local graph,
we ran a crawler to fetch pages and links within the domain. The crawler crawled 2,710,239 pages/files and found
100,079,061 link pairs before it was terminated. This captured 20% of the indiana.edu domain, which had about 13
million pages according to google. Basic page properties
(size, type, url, etc.) and the link data (30GB of pure text)
were then loaded into a PostgreSQL database for further
analysis.

3 Creating the Domain Graph
After the crawl was finished, the data were parsed and
loaded into two tables: nodes and links. Web contents were
not preserved. We removed all duplicates and URLs longer
than 250 characters. For link analysis, we ignored nontext/html files, resulting in a set of 1, 707, 676 unique nodes
and 43, 206, 848 unique links. We then used the remaining
hyperlinks to create a directed graph representation of the
local Web domain.

4 Network Analysis
Topological properties of the directed graph were examined. Figure 1 and 2 show the distributions of 1(a) in-

degree, 1(b) out-degree, 2(a) page size (all pages), and 2(b)
page size (text/html only) on log-log coordinates, because
of the large scale of the plots.

Figure 1. Degree Distributions
As shown in Figure 1(a), the in-degree distribution follows a power law with an exponent γin = 2.109 ± 0.0195.
This result is consistent with previous works [1, 7], in which
the authors found a γin = 2.1. We also notice a few outliers on the power-law distribution. This can be explained
by pages that form small groups and are highly connected
to each other.
Research have been done on models that characterize
scale-free degree distributions [4, 2, 11]. They proposed
that a network with this type of distribution grows under
“preferential attachment,” with the constraint that creators
of the Web sites only have partial views of the entire WWW
network when connecting to other pages.

In Figure 1(b), the out-degree distribution has a power
law cut-off. We obtained a γout = 2.09 ± 0.016. Different values were found in the literature: in [7] γout = 2.72,
whereas [1] γout = 2.45. It is not always clear what the
exact mechanisms are behind the out-degree. However, in
our case, it makes sense to fit the data as a power-law and
explain it with a scale-free model [11].
Interestingly, in Figure 2(a) for all pages and 2(b) for
text/html only, file size also follows a power-law. Figure
2(a) has a γsize = 1.308 ± 0.016, whereas 2(b) has γsize =
2.001 ± 0.017. This tells us that the majority of the Web
domain are small-size pages. In 2(a), there is a small jump
between 200 - 300 KB, which is likely a particularity of the
domain.

5 Visualizing the Domain Map
Co-citation analysis has been widely used in bibliographical analysis and, in recent years, has been adopted by
researchers to measure link-based similarities on the Web
[9]. Dean and Henzinger implemented a co-citation algorithm for finding related pages on the World Wide Web
and demonstrated promising results [8]. In our co-citation
analysis, hyperlinks were treated as citations. By definition,
the number of co-citations between any two nodes ni and
nj , where i = j, is the number of nodes that commonly
cited (or referred to) both ni and nj . Co-citations can thus
be derived from directed hyperlinks and used for identifying
similar and influential nodes in a given graph. If a web page
has many co-citations with many others, it can be treated as
a landmark in the topical communities.
For this visualization, we removed all internal links, that
is, only keeping links from different hosts. URLs with a
length > 250 characters were also removed because these
are probably dynamically generated URLs. Then, pages
with at least 2 incoming links were retrieved, resulting in
20,074 nodes. Co-citations between these nodes were com-

puted to form an undirected weighted graph. We rendered a
layout for the entire graph using VxOrd [6], which tried to
place similar objects close together and dissimilar objects
far apart in a 2-D space. The coordinates were then loaded
into Pajek [5] to produce the visualization shown in Figure
3. Co-citation edges have been removed in order to show
the nodes (dots) clearly.
In Figure 3 node color is based on log(in-degree). The
darker a node, the larger its in-degree. The layout visualizes
co-citational similarities in a 2D space, and is a semantic
map of the local domain. Nodes that frequently co-cite each
other are usually close together. Therefore, using colors and
proximities of the nodes, the map shows not only topical
closeness, but also connectivity distribution in the domain.
The majority of the nodes in the visualization are moderately interconnected, shown in green and yellow. It is obvious that there are several visible clusters, among which
highly connected nodes (in red and darker colors) are scattered. These high-degree nodes are landmarks of the map.
Labeling the nodes enables us to explore it. Close examination of the visualization tells that the main cluster consists of departmental sites, while the others are formed from

of common research areas. For example, information science clusters (6) are close to computer science (7), digital
libraries (8), and math & statistics (12). The digital libraries
cluster (8) is also adjacent to education (9). This visualization also clearly displays the “small jumps” or outliers on
the degree distributions. There are a number of darker dots
scattered on the map, which are likely highly-connected
nodes of small topical groups.

6 Conclusions
In this study, we analyzed a local Web graph by heuristically examining its network properties. The results were
consistent with previous works on the Web, and proposed
local scale-free features. Using co-citation analysis and visualization techniques, this paper offered a way to investigate a local Web structure and to visualize its domain map
that is more intuitively understandable. Future work will involve scaling up the algorithms and applying the techniques
to a broader context.
