Abstract
Providing efficient and easy-to-use graphical tools to
users is a promising challenge of data mining (DM). These
tools must be able to generate explicit knowledge and to
restitute it. Visualization techniques have shown to be an
efficient solution to achieve such goal. Even though considered as a key step in the mining process, the visualization step of association rules received much less attention than that paid to the extraction one. Nevertheless,
some graphical tools have been developed to extract and
visualize association rules. In those tools, various approaches are proposed to filter the huge number of association rules before the visualization step. However both
DM steps (association rule extraction and visualization)
are treated separately in a one way process. Our approach
differs, and uses meta-knowledge to guide the user during
the mining process. Standing at the crossroads of DM and
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), we present an integrated framework covering both steps of the DM process.
Furthermore, our approach can easily integrate previous
techniques of association rule visualization.

Introduction

Data mining (DM) techniques have been proposed and
studied to help users better understand and scrutinize huge
amounts of collected and stored data. In this respect, extracting association rules has grasped the interest of the
DM community. Thus, the last decade has been marked
by a determined algorithmic effort to reduce the computation time of the interesting itemset extraction step. The
obtained success is primarily due to an important programming effort combined with strategies for compacting data
structures in main memory. However, it seems obvious that
this frenzied activity loses sight of the essential objective

of this step, i.e., extracting a reliable knowledge, of exploitable size for users. Indeed, the unmanageably large
association rule sets compounded with their low precision
often make the perusal of knowledge ineffective, their exploitation time-consuming and frustrating for users. Moreover, unfortunately, this teenaged field seems to provide
results in the opposite direction with the evolving "knowledge management" topic.
Thus, DM techniques gain in presenting discovered
knowledge in an interactive, graphical form that often fosters new insights. Thus, the user is encouraged to form and
validate new hypotheses to the end of better problem solving and gaining deeper domain knowledge [7]. Visual data
analysis is a way to achieve such goal, especially when it
is tightly coupled with the management of meta-knowledge
used to handle the vast amounts of extracted knowledge.
We propose in this paper to exploit generic bases [2] in
order to losslessly reduce the number of rules. Such bases
contain the most informative association rules of minimal
premises (i.e., minimal generators) and maximal conclusions (i.e., closed itemsets). Their use can be seen as a
"sine qua non" condition to avoid that the visualization step
comes up short in dealing with large amounts of rules. In
fact, visualization techniques are frequently employed to
present the extracted knowledge in a form that is understandable to humans. Indeed, the information presented in
the form of images is more direct and easily understandable [6]. This makes graphical visualization tools more
appealing when handling large datasets with complex relationships. During the last few years, different graphical
approaches were proposed to present association rules in
order to solve the major problem previously quoted. Various works already exist to help user analysis. Their common main drawback is that they do not offer a global and
detailed view at the same time. Indeed, there is no representation which respects this point, which is crucial in

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) [20].
In our work, we are interested in presenting a scalable graphical-based visualization prototype, called C B VAR (1) , for handling association rules. Two interesting
features of our prototype are noteworthy:
1. It encompasses the step of generic association rule
extraction. As output, this step provides an XML
file recording the set of generic association rules.
2. It provides a "guided" exploration based on a
clustering of association rules.
Such clustering implements the Shneiderman’s recommendation
"Overview first...". "... then details on demand" are
provided in a fish eye view fashion once the user puts
the focus on the desired cluster. Laying on "divide
to conquer" idea, this clustering makes it possible to
portion the association rule set into smaller pieces of
knowledge that can be easily handled.
Interestingly enough, the prototype scope is not limited
to only handle generic bases since C B VAR allows the visualization of any set of association rules. The choice of handling generic bases is quite natural. Indeed, they present a
promising issue allowing a lossless reduction of the overwhelming number of association rules that can be extracted
even from small real-life datasets. Moreover, these generic
bases present an intrinsic structure that allows to automatically recommend the most adequate graphical visualization
technique.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 is dedicated to a detailed description of the
C B VAR visualization prototype after which Section 3
presents its evaluation. Section 4 presents our experimentations to validate our approach. Section 5 provides a review of related work and discusses in depth the visualization scalability issue. The last section ends with conclusions and future work.

Association Rules)

2.1

The prototype

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) works are focused on Visual Information-Seeking Mantra illustrated by
Shneiderman: "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details
on demand". First of all, graphical tools must provide a
global view of the system in order to deduce the main important points. The user must be able to determine the starting point of his analysis thanks to this global view. During
his analysis, he must be able to explore in-depth particular areas if desired. Indeed, all details are not of need

to be displayed at the same time. Unfortunately, all current representations do not respect this crucial point which
is necessary in order to visualize large set of knowledge.
Our purpose is to obtain a global and detailed view at the
same time, which is not the case of related work. Indeed,
the key to the success of a visualization prototype is a full
compliance with such recommendations. In the following,
we present a detailed description of the C B VAR prototype
that is implemented in JAVA and runs on UNIX system
(2)
. The main feature of C B VAR is that it presents an integrated framework for extracting and shrewdly visualizing
association rules. Thus, it avoids modifying the output format of the existing association rule mining algorithms to fit
into the visualization module input requirements. The user
has only to provide a data file and, at the end of the tunnel,
association rules can be visualized.
C B VAR is composed of two independent parts: generation of clusters and visualization of clustered association
rules. The first part will not be detailed in this paper because it does not focus on visualization. Briefly, in order to
obtain our clusters, we use several existing tools which are
gathered within a shell-script. The well known K- MEANS
algorithm [19] is applied on data. As output, we obtained
disjoint clusters s.t. each one contains a reduced cardinality
set of association rules. The choice of K- MEANS algorithm
is argued by the fact that it is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem. Moreover, the K- MEANS algorithm allows
obtaining a significant set of clusters [22]. The visualization part is described hereafter.

2.2

Association rule visualization: Unraveling
from global to detailed views

Actually, all graphical representations present advantage and drawbacks. For example, trees and graphs are
easily interpretable thanks to their hierarchical structure.
However, they are unreadable on dense data. Matrix 2D
and 3D use colors in order to highlight metrics but they
require cognitive efforts. Virtual reality allows introducing the user within the process in order to focus on a data
subset but the metaphor choice requires a good data comprehension. There is no representation which is the best.
Nevertheless, 3D matrix is a good compromise. We focused on 3D matrix "itemsets-itemsets". It is based on a
2D matrix but the third dimension is exploited. On the
other hand, the different kinds of association rule representations also present advantages and limitations which must
be taken into account depending on users’ preferences. All
these representations have a common limitation: they are
not global and detailed at the same time. Indeed, global
representations are quickly unreadable, whereas detailed

representations do not present all information. One of the
limitations of the existing representations is then to display
all rules in a same screen space. Indeed, the user’s visibility
and understanding are proportionally reduced according to
the number of rules. In addition, these representations are
not adapted to clusters visualization.
Several kinds of known representations were proposed to
study a large set of information as lenses and hyperbolic
trees [16], perspective walls [18], fisheyes view (FEV)
[11] or superposition of transparent views [14]. In our previous work, we showed that FEV is adapted to this kind
of problem [9]. Indeed, FEV shows the point of interest
in detail and the overview of the display in the same rep3 Available

resentation. This is done by distorting the picture which,
for this purpose, is not uniformly scaled. Objects far away
from the focus point are shrunk while objects near the focus point are magnified. The degree of visual distortion
depends on the distance from the focus point. Several tools
implement FEV as A I S EE (3) , I NFOV IS [10] and LARM
[8]. A first approach using a FEV in an association rule
visualization method was proposed in [9]. In this work,
authors exploited a merging representation in order to represent a set of rules. The focus point is a detailed rule. In
a similar manner, we will use it in our new prototype to
visualize a set of clusters (see Figure 1).
Thus, we merge both 2D and 3D representations. The

2D representation allows having a global association rule
view of one rule of each cluster. This rule is selected according to an interestingness measure such as lift [4], support or confidence [1]. Note that the lift measure is preferred by default, i.e., when the user does not give any
choice. So, each area represents one rule of the corresponding cluster and we use the focus point of the FEV to detail
the corresponding cluster, if FEV is active. To show it,
the magnified focus point displays a 3D cabinet projection
representation tackling occlusions appearance [8] and 2D
representation, respectively for sparse and dense contexts.
It is worth noting that a dense context is characterized by
the presence of at least one exact rule since minimal generators are different from their respective closures, which
is not the case for sparse contexts. In this case, users can
vary several metrics in real-time: support and confidence.
Moreover, main information and rules of the cluster are
given in text areas. C B VAR is dedicated to cluster visualization. Its purpose is not to detail in-depth information of
the current cluster but to visualize all clusters in the same
time. Thanks to a double click on the chosen cluster, we
propose to execute LARM which is able to obtain this detailed information. The main purpose of this hybrid representation is to use the advantages of both representations
in order to resolve our main problem. The next section
presents an evaluation of our prototype.

Evaluation
Methodology

We realized a preliminary evaluation of our clusters representation. The aim of this study was to establish if people can understand the representation of a set of clusters.
The set of data we used in our evaluation is divided on five
clusters. Moreover, we wished to evaluate the intuitive features of our interface. In order to avoid dodging the issue,
we select a set of computer science students who have no
preliminary knowledge of the toy example.
Each test concerns one student and one observer. Each
student is concerned by three parts: a free exploration
(FE), a demonstration (Demo) and a second exploration
(SE). The total evaluating time is equal to 15 minutes.
Firstly, during the FE part which lasts five minutes, a person is placed in front of our representation which is running
on a computer. He has neither instructions on the software
nor on its functionalities. Its aim is just to explore as he
wish. However, he must comment its actions and explains
what the visualization represents for him. Thus, during this
step, an observer is needed not to help the student but to
transcribe his actions and comments. The major questions
which are mentioned on the evaluation form aimed to know
whether the student established the links within the subsets
of data (i.e., the clusters) or not, and how the student reacts
with the 2D and 3D notions. The second step (Demo) is a

demonstration of the main functionalities by the observer
during three minutes. Finally, the student can realize a last
exploration (SE) during seven minutes. In this part, the
aim was to interrogate the student about the software (functionalities, easy-to-use points, etc.). This part was just an
informal discussion.

Results

Our sample is reduced and it doesn’t allow to lead to significant statistics. However, the used evaluation methodology (discount usability testing) [21] provides a correct
evaluation of initial perceptions of the visualizing methodology of C B VAR by real users. This kind of approach is
efficient to highlight the main advantages and drawbacks of
a user interface. Some major outlines [21] appeared during
this evaluation.
On the one hand, all students understood without explications that the visualization represents several data subsets. They didn’t know FEV notions but they used words
as groups or sets in order to define their perception of
the representation. Eight students discovered that options
2D/3D (sliders and radio buttons) were dependent with the
representation. The comments of six students are related
to the size of data (much, large, important). We can give
two preliminary conclusions. Firstly, C B VAR seems to be
intuitive in order to represent subsets of data. Secondly,
C B VAR seems to be relevant for the students to analyze
large datasets. These two points consolidate the visual approach of C B VAR.
On the other hand, three students mentioned that the visual deformation allows to research particular information.
However, seven students thought that 2D is more comprehensible than 3D. Consequently, it is difficult for them to
understand the information which is zoomed. But, eight
students guessed that colors must have a signification because they saw that colors are variable. Several students
criticized some functionalities of C B VAR as interact with
the 3D representation in order to have detailed information.
Six students understood that the cluster details are given in
text-way but they thought this representation is not easyto-understand. A global conclusion is that the visualization process using C B VAR is convivial, while its global
perception is clearly positive. Nevertheless, C B VAR still
presents possibilities for improving its functionalities.
In the next section, we present our experimental results.

Experimentations

It was worth the effort to experiment in practice the potential benefits of the proposed prototype. Experiments
were conducted on a Pentium IV 3 Ghz with 1 GB of main

from the FIMI website (4) . In the remainder, we put the
focus on the M USHROOM and the T10I4D100K datasets.
The first dataset, composed of 8124 transactions for 119
items, is considered as typical dense dataset. The second
dataset, composed of 100, 000 transactions for 1, 000
items, is considered as typical sparse dataset. A large number of association rules is expected to be mined from both
datasets, especially when lowering the minsup and minconf values. The number of extracted generic rules (denoted # generic rules) increases as far as we lower these
two metrics: from 537 (when minsup = 0.4 and minconf
= 0.4) to 7, 057 (when minsup = 0.2 and minconf = 0.2)
for the M USHROOM dataset, and from 594 (when minsup
= 0.006 and minconf = 0.006) to 3, 623 (when minsup = 0.004 and minconf = 0.004) for the T10I4D100K
dataset. The number of clusters is chosen according to the
number x of association rules that will be contained in each
cluster. Our results are depicted by Table 1. All XML files
are already unreadable in the same screen space due to the
relevant number of rules. Our approach allows visualizing
these benchmark datasets in the same screen space in approximately the same time with a number of clusters equal
rules
). Our tests with other numbers of clusto ( # generic

ters (i.e., for x = 25 and x = 50) require in general more
time to be displayed. However, they make it possible to
reduce the displaying time relative to each cluster, taken
separately from the others, since each cluster contains less
association rules (less than 100).
Table 1 also compares the total number of association
rules (5) (denoted # rules) with that of generic ones. Statistics clearly show the benefits of generic bases towards presenting to users a set of interesting association rules that is
compact as much as possible.
In order to interact in real-time, it is necessary to load
all rules in main memory. However, we can observe that
with a minsup (resp. minconf ) value equal to 0.2 (resp.
0.2) for the M USHROOM dataset and with a minsup (resp.
minconf ) value equal to 0.004 (resp. 0.004) for the
T10I4D100K dataset, it is no more possible to load them

in a classical visualization without clustering. Our approach allows visualizing the first dataset in 17, 953 ms

The second dataset is displayed with our approach for the
different values of x used in our tests. In this case, the
association rule set contains 3, 623 rules.
In this context, we did not use higher minsup values since
the number of generated rules will be too weak. A classical representation can then treat them. However, we mainly

Related work and scalability issue

Compared to the stampede algorithmic effort for extracting frequent (condensed) itemsets, only few works
paid attention to visualizing association rules. The work
of Hofmann et al. [15] mainly focused on visual representation of association rules and presented the relationships
between related rules using either interactive mosaic plots
(histograms) or double decker plots. In both approaches,
there is no focus on rule reduction and the user’s interaction
is limited. While, Liu et al. [17] presented an integrated
system for finding interesting associations and visualizing
them. Han and Cercone [13] proposed an interactive model
for visualizing the entire process of DM. They mainly focus on the "parallel coordinates" technique to visualize rule
induction algorithms.
Blanchard et al. [3] proposed an experimental prototype, called ARV IS, which is intended to tackle the association rule validation problem by designing a humancentered visualization method for the rule rummaging task.
This approach, based on a specific rummaging model, relies on rule interestingness measures and on interactive
rule subset focusing and mining. The work of Zaki and
Phoophakdee [24], introducing the M IRAGE tool, is the
only one handling a generic basis of association rules
(more precisely, that defined by the first author in [23]).

Even though this basis is not informative (and, hence, with
information loss), as outlined in [12], this system presents
a new framework for mining and visually exploring minimal rules (i.e., with minimal premises and also minimal
conclusions) using a lattice-based interactive rule visualization approach. Buono and Costabile in [5] described
a visual strategy that exploits a graph-based technique and
parallel coordinates to visualize extracted association rules,
under the so-called ARV IS (6) tool.
In all these methods, it remains extremely difficult to
visualize and understand the association information of a
large dataset even when all rules are available. Our approach contributes to avoid such limitations. In fact, the
ultimate goal is to bring the power of visualization technology to every desktop to allow a better, faster, and more
intuitive exploration of very large data resources [7]. Thus,
we believe that the scalability of graphical visualizations is
of paramount importance. The use of the "scalability" term
in this context may be misleading. However, we mean by
this term that a user has actually to explore both large and
small amount of knowledge with the same facility. Usually, the foggy and hazy interface that a user has to face
when browsing a large amount of association rules is never
showed when advertising graphical visualization systems
(e.g., the P URPLE I NSIGHT software (7) , the A SSOCIA TION RULE VIEWER (8) and the M IRAGE prototype [24]).
Indeed, faced with the deluge of association rules, a user
may be asked to rely on a tedious and boring application
of its perceptual abilities to explore such set of association
rules. Even if we consider that we only have to visualize generic association rules, their sufficiently high number (9) can dissuade users to perform a scrutinizing exploration. So, to go beyond such limitation, we provide
in this work a means to tackle the "scalability" issue by
performing a clustering on the generic association rule set
combined with the use of a FEV technique.

Conclusions and future work

In this paper, we presented the C B VAR prototype towards a scalable visualization of association rule sets. Its
main originality is that it uses a back-end meta-knowledge
to guide association rules through their clustering. Furthermore, this meta-knowledge allows a cooperative exploration of generic bases of association rules. Carried out experiments showed that thousands of rules can be displayed
in few seconds and that the proposed clustering-based visualization can be an efficient tool to handle a large number of association rules, thanks to a merging representation
which exploits both a 2D representation and a FEV. We

presented a first evaluation which consolidates this choice.
This approach allows obtaining a global and detailed view
at the same time. Nevertheless, our goal is not to automatically select the best relevant rules as it might be done
with other methods that use interestingness measures, but
to propose an interactive and intuitive approach that allows
the user to be able to visualize the whole set of generated
rules, and consequently to shed light on relevant ones. This
approach is thus complementary to any kind of selective
association rule methods, and can easily integrate any other
visualization tool which is suitable for small set of rules.
Another avenue for future work addresses the integration of other clustering algorithms as well as other visualization techniques such as perspective walls.
