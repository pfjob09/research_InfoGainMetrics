Abstract
This paper reports a bibliometric analysis of evolving
co-author networks. Using 5,009 articles covering the
years 1993 to 2005 from Transactions D. (Information Systems) of the Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE), we attempt to compare the
network characteristics for each year, the co-author network characteristics for the entire time span, and the four
major components of the entire data set. Finally, we analyze each of these in contrast to extant co-authorship network data and find that the pattern of co-authorship within
Information Systems does not change significantly over this
time period.

Introduction

Statistical and structural analysis of co-authorship networks can be a useful tool for analyzing relationships between various researchers within a scientific field or across
fields [9]. Used in conjunction with robust collection of bibliometric data, these analyses can help shed light on social
and institutional factors affecting co-authorship and, on a
larger-scale, scientific collaboration.
In this paper, we study a sub-set of articles from Transactions D. (information systems) of the Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE)
covering the years from 1993 to 2005 [7]. We subsequently
generate various statistics and network visualizations of the
co-authorship networks for the field of Information Systems
within Japan over this time span; the Information Systems

field per year; and the four largest components over this thirteen year period. Using these analyses, we then attempt to
examine whether or not these networks are similar to other
co-authorship networks and if any change can be noticed in
the pattern of co-authorship within this sub-discipline.

1.1

Prior Research

Most of the prior research done on co-authorship between scientific researchers in Japan was performed by public policy analysts in the mid-1990s [8]. Prior to a recent
study by Diana Hicks in 1995, it was argued by a few scholars that collaboration in Japan between researchers within
academia and industry were poor [5]. A few of the primary
reasons cited were: administrative or regulatory impediments, the weak applicability of academic research within
the commercial sector, insufficient funding that might help
promote such collaboration due to short-term policy planning, and the inability to reform the koza relationship. The
koza relationship is a fairly rigid relationship where most
collaborative work takes place between full professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and their graduate
students.
From a bibliometric perspective, there have also been
a few studies done in Japanese regarding co-authorship
amongst scientific researchers in Japan, though few place
emphasis on the koza relationship, which may be taken
for granted, when analyzing co-authorship data. Ryutaro
Ichise, et al. have studied co-authorship in Japanese research communities via data mining and graph visualization
techniques [6]. Yasuda, et al. have studied the importance
conferences play in Japan regarding co-occurrence of artificial intelligence researchers from data harvested from the

web [11]. For prior research regarding network theory, see
studies by Newman, Albert, Barab´asi, and Wasserman, et
al. [10].

Data

The data for this study is from the Institute of Electronics
Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE) covering the years 1993 to 2005. The Institute of Electronics
Information and Communication Engineers is considered
by many Japanese scholars to be the Japanese analogue to
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

.
IEICE transaction data is composed of four major areas, or ’Transactions’: A. Fundamentals, B .
Communications, C . Electronics, and D. Information
Systems. Five-thousand and nine articles were selected
from Transaction D. (Information Systems) for this study.
All of the data was initially converted from the EUC JP
encoding to UTF-8. Below are figures regarding the author
and article data extracted from Transactions D. of IEICE
from the years 1993-2005:
Total # of years: 13
Total # of articles (1993-2005): 5009
Total # of authors (1993-2005): 12,337
Avg. # of authors per year: 949
Avg. # of articles per year: 385
Avg. # of papers per author (1993-2005): 2.47
Avg. # authors per paper (1993-2005): 3.25
Avg. # of collaborations per author (1993-2005): 3.00
Largest # of authors for a single paper: 18
For each year, unique authors were extracted.
Initially, we attempted to extract the networks based on the
English transliteration of the Japanese surnames found
within the data. Those familiar with East Asian languages
may realize this can lead to a many-to-many transliteration
error via this approach.
Instead, focus was placed on the Japanese surnames,
which are less prone to inaccuracies within this data set. It
must be noted, however, that another problem encountered
were prior transcription errors within the Japanese surname
from when the data was initially input. This can cause
some problems for Japanese language parsers and lexical
analyzers which may parse data, for example, based on
byte-code sequences versus having a fixed word delimiter
such as a space in the English language.

Tools

The data was parsed using a Japanese language parser,
fed into a Japanese language lexical analyzer, and placed
into a relational database. Various functions to build the
nodes, edges, and network files were used to generate the
final network files within the database. These files were
then loaded as graphs into the R statistical programming
language. The igraph, sna, cluster, e1701 libraries of the R
programming language were then used to generate and analyze the statistical properties of all the networks described
here.

Japanese Co-authorship Networks within
Information Systems (IEICE)
Metrics

To gain some understanding of the underlying graph
structures, the following metrics were examined for each
of the four items mentioned in the introduction: (a) degree
centrality; (b) closeness centrality; (c) betweenness centrality; (d) clustering co-efficient (transitivity); (e) average path
length; (f) density; and (g) diameter. Many of these may be
familiar to the reader, though a brief explanation may help
those not familiar with these concepts.
Degree centrality computes the in-, out-, or total-degree
centrality of a graph, describing the size of a given vertex or
node’s neighborhood within the larger graph [4]. Closeness
centrality describes the distance of each node to all other
nodes. Betweenness centrality attempts to describe a node
or vertex’s position within the network in regard to the communication or flow it is able to control. The clustering coefficient, or transitivity, measures the probability that the adjacent vertices of a vertex are connected [10]. The average
path length calculates the average of the smallest number of
hops between any two vertices in a graph. Density is the ratio between the number of edges and the number of possible
edges in a fully connected graph of the same size. Diameter is the length of the longest geodesic, or the longest of
the shortest path lengths between any of the vertexes in the
graph [2].
The results for these metrics can be found in Table 1. All
singletons were removed from the graphs used for analysis. The mean value was determined for all of the centrality
scores. The entire matrices for each were used to generate
the plots below. To contrast our metrics, we also include coauthorship metrics from Newman and Barab´asi in Table 2.

Analysis

The degree distribution of authors-to-articles does not
deviate in character from other co-authorship networks for
various other scientific fields and confirms the fat-tailed distribution commonly found in such co-authorship networks
[9].
Computing the standard deviation for degree centrality
(0.0001), closeness centrality (0.0002), betweenness centrality (0.0171), and average path length (0.139), we found
very little deviation between these respective values over
the thirteen year period.
The distribution of each centrality measure was examined to determine if any of the networks deviated from the
standard normal distribution found in sample data used for
the entire network. For this, we used a q-q plot which is
commonly used to examine composite, dependent variables
(see figures below). As expected, they show very little differentiation.
The clustering co-efficient and the average path length
are also often analyzed for co-authorship networks. If a
rapid increase in the average number of co-authorships per
author or the number of co-authors per paper had occurred,
the average path length should decrease [1]. Both the clustering co-efficients and the average path length remain relatively unchanged over the thirteen year period, i.e. the char-

acter of co-authorship for this data, and perhaps this discipline, has not changed over time.
To supplement these results, we also compared our data
to those found in the co-authorship networks analyzed by
Newman and Barab´asi. The IEICE Information Systems
data exhibit a high clustering co-efficient similar to those
found in the other co-authorship networks. The average
path length is very close to the SPIRES network, though
smaller when compared to the NCSTRL, Math, and Neuroscience networks. Very similar to the SPIRES network,
the degree distribution for the Information Systems network
conforms to a power law P(k)αk = 2.216 exhibiting scalefree behavior, while the average path length remains relatively small, supporting a large number of highly-connected
hubs in what is ultimately a small-world network [3].

Conclusions

Analysis of the co-authorship data shows similar characteristics, such as clustering co-efficient and average path
length, found in other co-authorship networks from other
scientific disciplines, as shown by Newman and Barab´asi.
Although perhaps assumed and highly data dependent, this
may indicate a similar pattern of co-authorship may occur
within certain scientific fields, in this case Information Systems, regardless of the country of origin. These results have

motivated future study of this topic, as well as the common
metrics used to analyze real-world co-actor or co-author
networks to determine a metric’s significance when describing the concept of collaboration.
