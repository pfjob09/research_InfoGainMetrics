Abstract
This paper discusses the history of domain maps in
the context of similar developments in the field of
cartography. Drawing from its underlying definitions,
this paper identifies the purposes of domain maps and
discusses how they might specifically be applied in the
field of education and as front-ends to digital libraries.
Keywords--- domain mapping, history, theory,
cartography, digital libraries, education, future

1. Introduction
The field of domain mapping is mature enough to
merit some perspective, history, context, and an
examination of its parallels with other fields—
particularly cartography.
This paper presents a
conceptual framework for viewing the history of domain
mapping and examines its purposes and applications.

2. Definitions and Purpose
Domain mapping is for the most part a subfield of
information visualization. Furthermore, the purposes of
domain mapping, scientific visualization, and
information visualization are generally the same. These
purposes are revealed in each of their definitions.
Information visualization and scientific visualization
are strongly related (in fact, some note that the
distinctions between the two have begun to blur [34].
Thus, conceptualizations of the one field have helped to
illuminate the other. Scholars point to a 1987 coining of
visualization in the sense used by this community
[12,9,21]. This was in a report funded by the National
Science Foundation (USA) entitled: Visualization in
Scientific Computing [24]. While lacking a concise
definition of visualization, this work is one of the first of
many to repeat Hamming’s admonition that “[t]he
purpose of computing is insight, not numbers” [16].
Most early definitions of scientific visualization couple
computing technology and graphics leading to better
problem solving or the ability to understand complex or
large amounts of data [24,28].

The coining of information visualization appears to
have happened slightly later in 1989: “we describe an
application, called Information Visualization, which uses
2D and 3D animation to explore information and its
structure” [31]. The definition that is perhaps most often
cited for information visualization is “the use of
computer-supported, interactive, visual representations
of abstract data to amplify cognition” [38]. This
definition differs from the authors’ definition of general
visualization only in that information visualization
involves ‘abstract’ data. Thus, the images produced by
information visualization for the most part cannot be
mapped literally to a spatial environment or onto a
tangible, observable object such as an aircraft wing
experiencing turbulent airflow.

2.1. Purpose: Discovery & Explanation
From the earliest writings, the insight derived from
visualization, and hence its purposes, manifests itself in
four forms: (1) Discovery, (2) Understanding, (3)
Communication, and (4) Education [24,9,26]. These
may be collapsed into two general purposes: (1)
Discovery and (2) Explanation.
Discovery involves
novel problem solving or identifying an unknown
phenomena or even an unknown problem. Understanding
is another form of discovery that involves sense-making.
This is when an investigator has a general notion of a
problem or solution, but uses visualizations to solidify
his or her understanding generally or to perceive the
specific aspects crucial to a problem or solution. The
explanatory use of visualization is its communication
and educational functions.

2.2. Domain Mapping: Definition and Purpose
While their have been at least two sizable review
articles of the field of domain mapping [36,39], perhaps
the best and most concise definition of domain mapping
is: “the graphic rendering of bibliometric data designed
to provide a global view of a particular domain, the
structural details of a domain, the salient characteristics
of a domain (its dynamics, most cited authors or papers,
bursting concepts, etc.) or all three [19]. This is yet
another definition that is intertwined with the aims of the
entity being defined. Again, the same four purposes of

visualization generally, apply to domain mapping: (1)
Discovery, (2) Understanding, (3) Communication, and
(4) Education.

3. History of Domain Mapping with Parallels to
Cartography
Prior to the 1600’s cartography was merely
descriptive. Advances in calculating accurate locations
on the planet made it scientific [17,37,25,10]. These
cartographic advances include triangulation over large
distances from a known base measure, using the moons
of Jupiter to establish longitude on land, using accurate
time pieces to establish longitude at sea, and accurately
measuring depth and altitude and representing them on
maps. In a sense, the same has now occurred with
domain mapping. The merely descriptive has become
methodologically rigorous [40,41]. A description of the
algorithms for generating journal-level maps of science
can be found in [5].

3.1. Descriptive Domain Maps
One of the justifications for domain maps is their
long history. Descriptive, hand-drawn domain maps had
long been produced prior to the advent of
methodological rigorous techniques such as large scale
data mining employing co-citation or bibliographic
coupling. In 1939, John D. Bernal, physicist and
historian and sociologist of science, produced one of the
first ‘maps’ of science [3,6].
In 1948, Ellingham produced a beautifully hand
drawn chart showing “the relations between the branches
of natural science and technology.” [11]. Like most
domain maps, Ellingham’s chart is premised on the
distant-similarity metaphor (objects more similar to each
other are more proximate in space.)
Additional
relationships are indicated by the direction of the labels.
It was also intended that the two dimensional
representation would be wrapped as if around a cylinder
to show the continued relationships of topics on the
extreme left half with those on the right. In fact,
Ellingham lamented that he wished it were possible to
“allow for the chart to be spread over the surface of a
sphere and this would have the advantage of avoiding the
need to select a particular science to occupy the center.”
Furthermore, Ellingham overlay the coverage of
each of the extant index and abstracting services to
indicate which areas of science they covered. In this
manner, Ellingham’s chart is perhaps the first visual
front-end to a body of literature. There have also been
other hand crafted, descriptive domain maps that are
seldom cited by the field [32,30].

3.2 Rise of Methodological Rigor in Domain
Mapping
Eugene Garfield, a founding father
of
scientometrics, has always been quick to acknowledge
his influences. He acknowledged Frank Shepard’s legal

citator [27] as part of the inspiration for the Science
Citation Index and subsequent products [13,14]. In turn,
his work was part of the inspiration for Page and Brin’s
PageRank algorithm—the foundation for Google [20,2].
Garfield acknowledged Gordon Allen’s bibliographic
citation network diagram of papers relating to the
staining of nucleic acids as the departure point for his
pictorial map of the history of the discovery of the DNA
code [15] which validated and expanded upon the
historical account by Isaac Asimov [1]. This appears to
be the first mapping of a domain employing
methodological rigor—the use of citations to establish
the relationships between papers rather than the mere
interpretive warrant or subject expertise of the creator.
Subsequently in 1965, de Solla Price conducted an
extensive bibliographic analysis of the citation patterns
of scientific papers. In addition to producing several
charts and matrixes, de Solla Price contemplated that his
technique could “lead to a method for delineating the
topography of current scientific literature.” He went on
to refer to his proposed topography as a map [42].
1n 1968, Price & Schiminovich used bibliographic
coupling to map the literature of high energy physics.
[29]. Producing simple domain maps in the form of
graphs, papers with a higher percentage of common
citations were portrayed as being linked together with
thicker edges. The next jump in methodological rigor
was the simultaneous, yet independent, discovery of
using co-citation to map bodies of literature. This was
done by Small working in the United States and
Marshakova working independently in the Soviet Union
[33,23].
The above examples illustrate the first rigorously
associative techniques used to create domain maps: (1)
direct citation, (2) bibliographic coupling (the amount of
citations two items have in common) or (3) co-citation
(two earlier works being cited together by a third work.)
Ever since, the association techniques have become more
sophisticated, the methods of spatial layout have become
automated and more rigorous, and the datasets from
which the domain maps are created have become ever
larger [5]. In this fashion, domain mapping has moved
from the descriptive to the methodologically rigorous
(and thus scientific)—paralleling the same development
in the field of cartography.

4. Use, Adoption, and Implementation of
Domain Maps
Potentially, there are six phases in the use, adoption,
and implementation of domain maps. The first two have
already occurred and the remaining, prospective four
could happen in any order.
(1) [B]ibliometricians realized that they could
use bibliographic datasets and techniques such as
author co-occurrence to provide maps of a
particular discipline.
(2) [T]he implementation of automated
techniques for data harvesting, processing, and

information visualization that has facilitated the
mapping of larger domains.
(3) Domain maps will become widely known
outside of information science. They will
become popular with educators and will be used
to enhance classroom pedagogy.
(4) The widespread use of domain maps will
lead to steps that aim to harmonize and better
preserve the scholarly data from which they are
created.
(5) Domain maps will routinely be used as one
of the access options to digital libraries and
online public access systems (OPAC’s). See [4].
(6) Dynamic domain maps will capture and
portray the diffusion of information. Domain
maps will have predictive elements that will
forecast and model the spread of knowledge.
[19]

4.1 Domain Maps in Education
It is appropriate that one of the most prominent
discoveries in science (the structure of DNA) was
accomplished using spatial modeling [35]. Furthermore,
the subsequent historical telling of the process of the
discovery of DNA was one of the first spatial layouts of
a bibliographic representation of a field of research [15].
Similarly, this same discovery of the structure of DNA
through spatial modeling was more recently the lead off
story in a call to bring spatial thinking to more areas of
education [8]. This spatial thinking called for in
education can, in part, be supplied by the use of domain
maps [19]. Concepts maps are already widely used in
the field of education. They contain explicitly labeled
connections [43]. These linear connections are a
powerful grouping principle that conveys to the user the
association between concepts. The fact that the
connections are explicitly labeled allows the viewer to
utilize both textual and spatial memory storage areas of
his or her brain [19].

4.2 Neural Theory of Metaphor and Knowledge
In their 2003 afterword to their famous 1980 book,
Lakoff and Johnson survey current cognitive theory as it
relates to metaphors [45]. The two authors point to
neural theory for the best explanation of how metaphors
work. The human brain functions as a result of neural
circuitry. It is made up of billions of biologically and
chemically linked cells called neurons. During sensory
experiences, different neural clusters are activated.
Associations between different sensory experiences
result from consistent co-activation of different clusters
of neurons. Eventually, these associations become fixed

via the “recruitment of neural circuitry linking them” [45
at 259]. In a similar process, abstract concepts also
become linked. This gives rise to metaphors in which
“highly structured neural ensembles in different regions
of the brain” [45 at 256] are associated together through
repeated co-activation. Lakoff and Johnson speculate
that the intricacies of neural associations provide the
basis for “a unified theory of thought and language based
on neural computation” [45 at .271]. In other words, all
knowledge is built upon a series of ever more complex
neural associations.
Domain maps leverage spatial metaphors to make
associations between concepts apparent to the viewer
[46]. Consistent with the neural theory of metaphor and
knowledge, it is hoped that viewing a representation of
the structural aspects of a domain, will facilitate the
creation of associations in the various regions of the
brain between the concepts viewed on the domain map.

4.3 Domain Maps as Front-Ends to Literatures
As anticipated by Ellingham, domain maps can be
useful front-ends to a body of literature or online
learning environments [4,18]. By navigating the
literature while interacting with a domain map, the user
has the potential of sub-consciously and effortlessly
internalizing the structure of the domain. Furthermore, a
user might be able to infer knowledge about an unknown
category based on its adjacencies to known categories.
Such assertions await rigorous user-testing. Figure 1 is
a prototype of a domain map functioning as a front-end
to a body of literature. It is a interactive web
environment that allows a user to find bibliographic
information about ARIST (Annual Review of
Information Science and Technology) content while,
amongst other means, navigating a domain map. It was
created for a user interface design class by the author and
his fellow student, Ian Aliman.

Conclusions
Domain mapping, is in part, academic storytelling
[44]. This has been the partial story of the history of
domain mapping. Similar to what occurred in the field
of cartography, domain mapping moved from being
merely descriptive to being scientifically rigorous.
While domain maps intuitively resonate with some (most
likely visual learners [18]), others ask what purpose they
serve.
Domain maps assist with the discovery,
understanding, communication and teaching of
knowledge. Domain maps have particular potential in
the field of education and as front-ends to digital
libraries.
