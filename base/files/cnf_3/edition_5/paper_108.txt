Abstract
Broadcast algorithms are are very important in parallel and distributed computing. In this paper we design
new sparce graphs and present a minimum time broadcast
algorithms from any vertex of these graphs. A broadcast
graph on n vertices is a graph which allows any vertex to
broadcast in time log n . A minimum broadcast graph
on n vertices is a broadcast graph with the minimum number of edges over all broadcast graphs on n vertices. This
minimum number of edges is denoted by B(n). Many papers have presented methods to construct broadcast graphs.
Here we present a method to construct a broadcast graph on
n + 1 vertices by adding a vertex to a broadcast graph on
n vertices. Our general upper bound on B(n) improves the
best known upper bounds for almost all odd values of n.
Our broadcast algorithms are simple. Our new broadcast
graphs can be combined using some of the known methods
to obtain further improvements.

1. Introduction
Broadcasting is an information distribution problem
in a connected graph, in which one vertex, called the
originator, must distribute a message to all other nodes
by placing a series of calls along the communication lines
of the graph. Once informed, the informed nodes aid the
originator in distributing the message. This is assumed to
take place in discrete time units. The broadcasting is to be
completed as quickly as possible, subject to the following
constrains:
• Each call involves only one informed vertex and one
of its
uninformed neighbors.
• Each call requires one unit of time.

• A vertex can participate in only one call per unit of
time.
• In one unit of time, many calls can be performed in
parallel.
Formally, any network can be modeled as a graph G =
(V, E), where V is the set of vertices (or nodes) and E is the
set of edges (or communication lines). For a given originator vertex u we define the broadcast time of vertex u, b(u),
as the minimum number of time units required to complete
broadcasting from vertex u. Note that for any vertex u in
a connected graph G on n vertices, b(u) ≥ log n , since
during each time unit the number of informed vertices can
at most double. The broadcast time b(G) of the graph G
is defined as max{b(u)|u ∈ V }. G is called a broadcast
graph if b(G) = log n .
The broadcast f unction B(n) is the minimum number
of edges in any broadcast graph on n vertices. A minimum
broadcast graph or mbg is a broadcast graph on n vertices with only B(n) edges. Therefore, minimum broadcast graphs represent the communication networks with the
fewest communication lines in which broadcasting can be
accomplished from any vertex s fast as theoretically possible.
The problem of determining b(u) for a vertex u in an
arbitrary graph is N P − complete [20]. Thus, several
approximation algorithms with a polylogarithmic ratio are
suggested [1], [8], [25]. The best approximation algorithm
is presented in [7]. Minimum broadcast graphs are very
difficult to construct. Currently, exact values of B(n) are
known only for n = 2p , n = 2p − 2, n = 127, and
for several values of n ≤ 63. [10] studied the broadcast
function B(n); they showed that hypercubes are mbgs and
B(2p ) = p2p−1 for any pgeq1. [21] and [5] proved independently that B(2p − 2) = (p − 1)(2p−1 − 1) for all p ≥ 2.
Since mbg’s seem to be extremely difficult to find,
many authors have devised methods to construct broadcast
graphs. The number of edges in any broadcast graph on n

vertices gives an upper bound on B(n). Several papers have
shown methods to construct broadcast graphs by forming
the compound of two known broadcast graphs (see [2], [6],
[17] and [21]). These methods have proven effective for
graphs on n1 n2 vertices from two known broadcast graphs
on n1 and n2 vertices. Thus, compounding produces good
upper bound on B(n) for many even values of n. In particular, a very tight upper bound is obtained for n = 2p − 2k
by compounding minimum broadcast graphs on 2k−1 and
p
k
2p−k+1 − 2 vertices: B(2p − 2k ) = 2 −2
(p − k+1
2
2 ) (see
[2], [21]).
Broadcast graphs on other sizes can sometimes be
formed by adding or deleting vertices from known broadcast graphs (see [4] for example). An efficient vertex addition method is suggested in [16]. [17] presents a method
based on compounding and then merging several vertices
into one that allows the construction of the best broadcast
graphs for almost all values of n, including many odd numbers. In particular a very tight upper bound on B(n) is
B(n = 2p −2k +1) ≤ 2p−1 (p− k2 ) (again by compounding
mbg’s on 2k and 2p−k vertices and then merging 2k vertices
into one).
In 1979 Farley ([9]) proposed a recursive method to conn
struct broadcast graphs and proved that B(n) ≤ n log
2
p−1
p
for all 2
< n ≤ 2 . This is the best general upper
bound on B(n). The second general upper bound on B(n)
is obtained from a direct construction using binomial trees
([21, 17, 15]). Direct construction of broadcast graphs is a
difficult problem. The best upper bound from a direct constraction for any n is B(n) ≤ n(p − k + 1) − 2p−k − 12 (p −
k)(3p−k+3)+2k ([17]), where n = 2p −2k −r, 0 ≤ k ≤ p
and 0 ≤ r ≤ 2k − 1. While this is a tight bound for p − k is
p
small, for 2p − 2 2 < n ≤ 2p it is not as good as the bound
from [9].
The best general upper bound on B(n) for even n is obtained from the modified Kn¨odel graph ([22, 2, 11]). This
n
bound, B(n) ≤ n log
, is better than the one from [9] for
2
all even n = 2p . Note also that this bound comes from a
direct construction of modified Kn¨odel graphs.
There is no similar general upper bound on B(n) for odd
values of n. This paper attempts to fill this gap. Our upper bound formula is complicated, but it is approximately
n
for all n = 2p . We obB(n) ≤ n2 ( log n + 25 ) < n log
2
tain this bound from the modified Kn¨odel graph by adding
a vertex and connecting it to the vertices of a dominating
set of the modified Kn¨odel graph. Our new bound is an
improvement of the one from [16] and it holds for all odd
values of n. [16] describes a new vertex addition method by
applying this to the modified Kn¨odel graph on n = 2p − 2.
It also presents a minimum broadcast graph on 127 vertices
by adding 16 vertices to a Hamiltonian graph on 111 vertices. In this paper we focus on a general upper bound on
B(n) for odd n. Although the method is the same the proof

techniques are different.
This paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we
propose a dominating set of a modified Kn¨odel graph. In
section 3, the construction of broadcast graphs on any odd
number of n is presented. In section 4, we introduce a general upper bound on B(n) for any odd n.

2. Dominating Set in Modified Kn¨odel Graph
In this section we will prove that the modified Kn¨odel
graph KGn for n ≥ 26 has a dominating set of size
n
. Kn¨odel graphs have been originally introduced in
2 10
1975 [22]. They were underlying Kn¨odel’s construction of
a time optimal algorithm for gossiping among an even number of vertices.
In 1994 Fraigniaud and Peters [13] formally defined the
generalized family of Kn¨odel graphs.
[13] The generalized Kn¨odel graph on n ≥ 2 vertices (n
is even) and of maximum degree 1 ≤ ∆ ≤ log n is denoted by W∆,n . The vertices of W∆,n are V (W∆,n ) =
{(i, j)|i ∈ {0, 1} and j ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., n2 − 1}}. The
edges of W∆,n are E(W∆,n ) = {((0, j), (1, j + 2k −
1 mod n2 ))|k = 0, 1, ..., ∆ − 1}.
The generalized Kn¨odel graphs have good broadcasting and gossiping properties when ∆ = log n (see
[3, 5, 13, 11, 21, 24]). In [3] these graphs are called modified
Kn¨odel graphs and denoted by KGn . The vertices of KGn
are labeled {(i, j)|i ∈ {0, 1} and j ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., n2 − 1}}.
The edges of KGn are ((0, x), (1, y)), where y = x +
2k − 1(mod n2 ), k = 0, 1, ..., log n − 1. These edges
form a perfect matching and are called edges of dimension
k. Vertices (0, x) and (1, y) are called k − dimensional
neighbors.
It has been shown that some of the graphs given in the
literature as examples of Minimum Broadcast Graphs (see
[5, 21]) or Minimum Gossip Graphs [24] are in fact isomorphic to modified Kn¨odel graphs.
Our new broadcast graph construction is based on a dominating set of the modified Kn¨odel graphs.
In a graph G = (V, E), a set S ⊆ V is a dominating set
if every vertex not in S (u ∈ V \S) has a neighbor in S.
In other words, every vertex either belongs to a dominating set or is connected to at least one vertex that is in
the dominating set. The dominating set is called minimum
dominating set if it is a dominating set and there is no other
dominating set with smaller cardinality. The cardinality of
a minimum dominating set of graph G is called the dominating number of graph G. Finding a minimum dominating
set in an arbitrary graph is a difficult problem. It is clear
that in any bipartite graph the set ov vertices that belong
to the same bipartition is a dominating set for that bipartite graph. However that is not a minimum dominating set.

Since Kn¨odel graph is a bipartite graph then it has a dominating set of size n2 . Finding a minimum dominating set for
a Kn¨odel graph is an interesting problem itself, and seems to
be not an easy task. In this paper we cosntract a dominating
set of size n5 .
Now we will prove that there exists a dominating set of
n
size 2 10
in KGn . Note that all logarithms in this paper
are to the base 2.
n
R = {(0, 5r), (1, 5r + 4)|0 ≤ r ≤ 10
− 1} is a dominating set in KGn for all n ≥ 64.
We will prove that every vertex in KGn is either in subset R or has a neighbor in R for n ≥ 64. Figure 1 shows
some vertices of the dominating set R.
n
Suppose R0 = {(0, 5r)|0 ≤ r ≤ 10
− 1} and R1 =
n
{(1, 5r + 4)|0 ≤ r ≤ 10 − 1}. Thus, R = R0 ∪ R1 .
For any (u, v) ∈ V (KGn ), u is either 0 or 1 and v
has one of the following forms: 5r, 5r + 1, 5r + 2, 5r +
n
− 1. Then,
3 or 5r + 4, where 0 ≤ r ≤ 10
(u, v) ∈ {(0, 5r), (0, 5r+1), (0, 5r+2), (0, 5r+3), (0, 5r+
4), (1, 5r), (1, 5r + 1), (1, 5r + 2), (1, 5r + 3), (1, 5r + 4)},
n
− 1. So, to prove our theorem we have to
for 0 ≤ r ≤ 10
show that every vertex (x, 5r + y), where x = {0, 1} and
0 ≤ y ≤ 4 is connected to a vertex in R.
Note that all the numbers here are mod n2 . Thus, in the
text below mod n2 will be omitted for numbers less than
n
2 . If log n ≥ 4, any vertex in KGn has at least four
neighbors. Therefore, for each value of r, where 0 ≤ r ≤
n
10 −1, all four vertices (1, 5r), (1, 5r+1), (1, 5r+3) and
(1, 5r + 7) are neighbors of vertex (0, 5r) ∈ R0 . Similarly,
n
−1 all four vertices (0, 5r+1), (0, 5r+3),
for 0 ≤ r ≤ 10
(0, 5r + 4) and (0, 5r − 3) are neighbors of vertex (1, 5r +
4) ∈ R1 . Therefore, every vertex (x, 5r + y), where x ∈
{0, 1} and 1 ≤ y ≤ 4, except vertices of form (0, 5r + 2)
and (1, 5r + 2), is connected to a vertex in R for all of
n
− 1.
0 ≤ r ≤ 10
n
When 1 ≤ r ≤ 10
− 1, (1, 5r + 2) = (1, 5(r − 1) + 7).
Since (1, 5(r − 1) + 7) is a neighbor of (0, 5(r − 1)) ∈ R0
then all the vertices of form (1, 5r + 2), where 1 ≤ r ≤
n
10 − 1, have a neighbor in R0 . So, every vertex of form
(1, 5r + 2) except (1, 2) is connected to a vertex in R0 .
n
−2, (0, 5r+2) = (0, 5(r+1)−3), and
When 0 ≤ r ≤ 10

n
then all vertices of form (0, 5r+4), where 0 ≤ r ≤ 10

have a neighbor in R1 . Thus, every vertex of form (0, 5r +

connected to vertex (1, 4) ∈ R1 .

(1, 29) ∈ R1 .
Therefore, R is a dominating set in KGn for all
log n ≥ 6.

3. Construction of Broadcast Graphs on Odd
Number of Vertices
In this section we present a construction of broadcast
graphs on n vertices, where n is odd and n ≥ 65.
The basic idea of this method is to add an extra vertex
w to a modified Kn¨odel graph KGn−1 on n − 1 vertices
and additional edges connecting w to every vertex in the
dominating set R (from Section 2) of KGn−1 . Some other
supplemental edges are also needed in this method. The
supplemental edges connect w to all the neighbors of vertex
(0, 3) ∈ V (KGn−1 ). The neighbors of (0,3) are (1, 2k +
2 mod n−1
2 ) for k = 0, 1, ..., log(n − 1) . Thus, the set of

the supplemental edges is {(w, (1, 2k + 2 mod n−1
2 ))|k =
0, 1, ..., log(n − 1) − 1}. These supplemental edges are
necessary in the broadcast scheme of originator w (see the
proof of Theorem 3). The new constructed graph is shown
in Figure 2.
Since vertex (0,3) has neighbors in the dominating set R,
some supplemental edges (connecting w to the neighbors
of vertex (0,3)) and additional edges (connecting w to the
vertices of R) are the same. So, less edges are needed to
connect w with KGn−1 . Note that vertex (0,3) is not the
only choice. However, no other vertex has more neighbors
in dominating set R than vertex (0,3). Actually any vertex
n
− 1 has the same
(0, 5r + 3) or (1, 5r + 1) for 0 ≤ r ≤ 10
number of neighbors in R as vertex (0,3).
In [3], Bermond et al. studied routing, broadcasting and
gossiping in Kn¨odel graphs using at each step only edges
in a certain dimension i. Let l1 , l2 , ..., lk−1 , lk be a permutation of dimensions of a modified Kn¨odel graph, where
l1 = lk and k = log n . To broadcast a message from an
originator, any informed vertex simply forwards the message to its neighbor in the li -th dimension at each time unit
i (where 1 ≤ i ≤ k and lk = l1 ). Such a broadcast scheme
is called a dimensional broadcast scheme. They proved
that 1, 2, ..., k − 1, 1 is a dimensional broadcast scheme for
KGn , where log n = k and n is not a power of 2. This
means that at time t every informed vertex x sends the message to its t-dimensional neighbor for 1 ≤ t ≤ k − 1 and to
its f irst-dimensional neighbor for t = k. They also proved
that i, i − 1, ..., 1, k − 1, k − 2, ..., i + 1, i, or its reversal, is
also a dimensional broadcast scheme. Note that under this
dimensional broadcast scheme the originator and its i-th dimensional neighbor are idle at time k = log n .
These dimensional broadcast schemes will be used in the
proof of our next theorem.
Let KGn−1 = (V (KGn−1 ), E(KGn−1 )) be a modified Kn¨odel graph on n − 1 vertices, where 2p−1 − 1 <
n = 2p − 1. Let R be the dominating set in KGn−1 defined above. Then G = (V, E) is a broadcast graph, where
V = V (KGn−1 )∪{w} and E = E(KGn−1 )∪{(w, v)|v ∈
R} ∪ {(w, (1, 2k + 2 mod n−1
2 ))|k = 0, 1, ..., log n − 1}.
To prove that G is a broadcast graph, we must describe
a log n (theoretical minimum) time broadcast scheme for
every originator u ∈ V . Since n is odd and 2p−1 − 1 < n =
2p − 1, p = log(n − 1) = log n = log n + 1, and
also log(n − 1) = log n = p − 1. Recall that since the
degree of every vertex in KGn−1 is equal to log n then
the broadcast originator is idle during the last unit of time.
Next we will describe broadcast schemes for each originator
u in graph G.
If u ∈ R, then u informs all other vertices of KGn−1
according to the dimensional broadcast scheme 1, 2, ..., p −
1, 1 for originator u in the modified Kn¨odel graph KGn−1 .
Since u is idle at time unit p it sends the message to vertex

w at time p. Thus, all vertices of G will be informed after
time p.
If u ∈ V (KGn−1 )\R, then there must exist a vertex v ∈
R which is a neighbor of u. Suppose v is the i-th dimensional neighbor of u, for some 1 ≤ i ≤ log n . According
to Lemma 2 from [3], (i, i + 1, ..., p − 1, 1, 2, ..., i − 1) is a
dimensional broadcast scheme in KGn−1 for originator u.
Under this dimansional broadcast scheme, in p time units
all the vertices of KGn−1 will be informed, and vertices u
and v will be idle at time p. Therefore, vertex v can inform
w at time p.
If u = w, then it actually uses the dimensional broadcast scheme 1, 2, ..., p−1, 1 in KGn−1 for originator (0, 3).
Under this broadcast scheme vertex (0, 3) informs vertex
(1, 2t−1 +2 mod n−1
2 ) at time unit 1 ≤ t ≤ p−1, and (0, 3)
is idle at time p (since it already informed vertex (1, 3) at
time 1). All the vertices (1, 2t−1 + 2 mod n−1
2 ) continue
broadcasting in KGn−1 according the dimensional broadcast scheme 1, 2, ..., p − 1, 1. All the neighbors of vertex
(0, 3) in KGn−1 are now connected to vertex w. So, in
broadcasting from originator w in graph G vertex w will act
as vertex (0, 3) in KGn−1 using the dimensional broadcast
scheme 1, 2, ..., p − 1, 1. More precisely, vertex w sends the
message to the vertex (1, 2t−1 + 2 mod n−1
2 ) at time unit
1 ≤ t ≤ p − 1. All the vertices (1, 2t−1 + 2 mod n−1
2 ) continue the dimensional broadcasting in graph KGn−1 . After
time unit p all the vertices of graph G, except vertex (0, 3)
will be informed. Note that vertices w and (1, 3) are idle
at time p (w acts as vertex (0, 3) in graph KGn−1 under
the dimensional broadcast scheme 1, 2, ..., p − 1, 1). Thus,
vertex (1, 3) can inform vertex (0, 3) at time p.
Figure 3 illustrates the broadcast scheme of the vertex w
in G.

4. General Upper Bound on B(n) for Odd n.
From the broadcast graph G constructed in the last section, a general upper bound on B(n) for odd n can be obtained.
For any odd n ≥ 65 and n = 2p + 1,
B(n) ≤ (n+1)2 log n + 2 n−1
− log 4n +2 .
10
According to Theorem 3, G = (V, E) is a broadcast
graph on n vertices. Thus, B(n) ≤ |E| = |E(KGn−1 )| +
|{(w, v)|v ∈ R} ∪ {(w, (1, 2k + 2 mod n−1
2 ))|k =
0, 1, ..., log n −1}|. Recall that for modified Kn¨odel graph

10
.
log n = (n+1)2 log n + 2 n−1
10
Note that the sets R and {(w, (1, 2k + 2 mod n−1
2 ))|k =
0, 1, ..., log n − 1} have common vertices. Therefore,
we can obtain more accurate bound by subracting |R ∩

{(w, (1, 2k + 2 mod n−1
2 ))|k = 0, 1, ..., log n − 1
from the upper bound above. However, the exact value
of the last expression is different for different values of
n. Thus, we will give a lower bound on it. Recall

Our construction gives an improved upper bound on
B(n) for all odd values except n = 2p − 2k + 1, and perhaps for some small values of n. Combining our new upper
bound with the upper bound construction from the modified
Kn¨odel graph on even number of vertices we obtain a new
n
general upper bound B(n) ≤ n2 ( log n + 25 ) < n log

for all n = 2p . Our new broadcast graphs can be combined using some of the known methods to obtain further
improvements.
