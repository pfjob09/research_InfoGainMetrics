Abstract
Research in the area of spatial visualization
enjoys a long tradition in the discipline of cognitive
psychology. However, the computer graphics
profession, particularly the educational component,
takes into account a person’s spatial abilities as a
means for designing effective instructional experiences
and assessments. It builds on a learner’s visual or
haptic abilities. This paper will outline a brief history
of visualization assessments instruments and strategies
and their use within computer graphics-related
learning environments. The use of virtual reality
technologies to enable the learning process will also
be discussed, as well as an introduction to visual
science as a discipline.

1. A Review of Spatial Ability Research
Spatial ability research has a long history that is
as broad as it is deep. With implications for almost
every field of study and career path, there has been
much interest in determining what it is, how it
contributes to the overall human intellect, how it may
or may not interact with other factors or variables and
ultimately, the development of myriad methods for
measuring it.
It should not surprise the reader that finding
methods for improving and developing spatial ability,
as well as determining the field specific implications
of its existence, impact, and outward manifestations
remains the primary goal within the research. Spatial
ability research emerged during the 20th century, with
Multiple Intelligences [3], [4]. The second era of
spatial ability research emerged in the period from
WWII to the early to mid 1960s. During this time,
researchers devoted much of their energy towards

its beginnings appearing in the early 1920s. The first
era of spatial ability research saw researchers in
psychology beginning to acknowledge the existence of
a “spatial factor” involved in intelligence. The era
ended shortly before the start of WWII, but not before
redefining methods for intellectual measurement and
in tandem, acknowledging the existence of a spatial
factor.
The concept of spatial ability evolved from
psychometric research and theory, and it defines
spatial capacity as being separate and distinct from
other aptitudes, such as verbal or reasoning ability [1],
[2]. The first identification of spatial ability as a major
factor in human intellect was a 1921 paper titled On
the Organization of Intellect by E. L. Thorndike.
While much of his work dealt with animals, he
extended his conclusions into the human realm. It was
Thorndike’s acknowledgement of “mechanical
intelligence” that serves as the historical starting point
for spatial ability research. He defined “mechanical
intelligence” as the ability to visualize relationships
among objects and understand how the physical world
functioned.
Thurstone's Multiple Factors theory identified
seven primary mental abilities, which included
associative memory, number facility, perceptual
speed, reasoning, spatial visualization, verbal
comprehension, and word fluency. This theory was the
basis for intelligence tests that yield a profile of the
individual performance from several ability scores,
rather than the single mark yielded by intelligence
tests of the day. Thurstone’s work is also mirrored
(while not in a direct one-to-one relationship) by
modern research theories such as Gardner’s Theory of
defining the composition of spatial ability and tools
for measuring those component factors. Much of the
early research of this period focused on the need to
train soldiers for WWII.

At the end of this period, there was general
agreement that there were three primary factors
involved in quantifying spatial ability, as well as
several sub-factors. Thurstone identified these factors
as S1, which is the ability to recognize an object if
viewed from different orientations or angles; S2,
which is the ability to recognize the parts of an object
if they were moving or are displaced from their
original position; and S3, which is the ability to use
one’s body orientation to relate to questions regarding
spatial orientation. There has been lasting agreement
and support for the existence of three primary factors
in quantifying spatial ability. This era also brought
forth the idea of sub-factors that contribute to spatial
ability, such as biological, cultural, and educational
factors. However, the era ended with no agreement on
the sub-factors and that continues to this day. From
this era also emerged several valid and reliable
instruments for measuring these various factors [5].
The work of the second era led to the
development of many paper and pencil tests as
cataloged by Eliot and Smith [6]. From the 1960s to
the mid to late 1980s, researchers examined factors
such as gender, environment (biological, cultural,
social, and educational), age, learning style,
hemispheric specialization, and speed and efficiency.
The largest portion of the literature generated during
this era focuses on gender and environmental factors.
Nevertheless, while the evidence of the impact of
gender or environment (or an interaction of the two) is
not conclusive, it is evident that they do play some
role in the development and exhibition of spatial
ability.

2. The Importance of Spatial Ability
Literature that highlights the importance of spatial
ability abounds. Researchers from fields ranging from
art and education to science and engineering have
focused on spatial ability. Researchers indicate that
without spatial ability, success within specific
knowledge domains is limited. These domains, while
not an exhaustive list, include architecture, astronomy,
biochemistry, biology, cartography, chemistry,
engineering, geology, mathematics, music, and
physics. Ghiselli [7] found that success in fields such
as mathematics, architecture, and engineering is highly
predicted by one’s ability to visualize and mentally
manipulate objects. And, the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics [8] indicated that spatial
understandings are necessary for interpreting,
understanding, and appreciating our inherently
geometric world. Ben-Chaim, Lappan and Houang [9]

explained that there has been much interest in studying
this ability because spatial visualization is important in
most technical-scientific occupations, and especially
to the study of mathematics, science, art, and
engineering. Thus a logical conclusion is made by
Coleman & Gotch when they state, “if spatial
perceptual skills are important to success, further
research more rigorously pursuing the relations
between intervention and spatial ability would be very
useful” [10].

3. Methods for Improving Spatial Ability
In response to the call for improving spatial
ability and providing methods for doing so, research
on spatial ability improvement is increasing. While
there are a limited number of studies that question the
effect of training on spatial ability. These studies
propose that spatial ability is a biological
predisposition; however, Miller and Bertoline [11] and
others refute this, highlighting that the ability develops
over time during different stages of life – a result of
exposure to varied learning environments or life
experiences. Based on the balance of literature, it
appears that many different types of interventions can
indeed improve spatial ability.
It is apparent from spatial ability research that
there are three (3) factors associated with spatial
ability. As researchers began to address spatial issues
relative to human performance in specific ways,
Thurstone’s aforementioned concepts came to be
known by more descriptive terms, such as Mental
Rotations (S1), Spatial Visualization (S2), and Spatial
perception (S3) [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. It is also
well recognized that spatial ability is very important
for certain disciplines, such as those preparing
engineering and technical professionals. It is also
apparent that it is possible to improve the spatial
ability of students.
In a parallel vein to that suggested by Thurstone,
Wiley [17], suggests that these properties of spatial
ability can be embedded into a curriculum that
promotes a holistic understanding of engineering
graphics techniques, tools and processes. However, a
great deal of the research relative to engineering
design graphics education has centered on the ability
to predict the success of a student in the
comprehension of a particular tool or concept [18],
[19], [20]. Visualization research has been used as a
background for the design of instructional activities
[21], [22]. Computer graphics educators have used
research on visual abilities as a means to explain
difficulties that students have with geometric

representation techniques and methods, especially 3D
geometry projection onto 2D planes [23], [24].
Computer graphics educators have also used research
on visual abilities as a means by which to explain a
student’s knowledge of 3D space. Visual abilities (and
the tests to measure them) have been used as a means
to predict or explain success (or lack thereof) in the
use of computer graphics tools, likely due to its use of
an artificial 3D space [25], [26], [27]. In addition,
these examinations of student abilities have typically
used a rotations-based instrument to assess spatial
ability.

4. Immersive Environments and the Link
to Education
Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-based
technology that provides visual, aural, and tactile
stimuli of a 3-dimensional virtual world that is
generated and updated in real time as the user moves
through the environment [28]. Virtual Reality can be
applied to learning scenarios that allow learners to
become immersed in a computer generated virtual
world, redefining the human-computer interface [29].
VR has evolved into a computer-created sensory
experience that not only allows a user to believe in and
barely distinguish a virtual experience from a real one,
but can also allow a user to participate in experiences
which could never take place in the “real world.” In
an educational context, VR can be defined as a mode
of interaction between the user (learner) and a
computer-generated environment, in which the learner
is able to: 1) both view and manipulate virtual objects
which behave in believable and appropriate manner,
and 2) heighten use of multi-sensory, multi- perceptual
and multi-dimensional capabilities in order to increase
understanding in learning [30], [31].
These two aspects, namely, the ability to interact
with virtual objects in a natural way, and the
heightened use of multi-sensory, multi-perceptual
functioning by the learner, are what make VR a
potentially powerful tool for learning. According to
Fallman [32], VR can be used to “facilitate an
interaction style of learning which stimulates,
motivates and enhances student understanding of
learning events”, particularly in those areas in which
uses of traditional methods of teaching have been
inappropriate or inadequate.
The levels of learner participation within the
virtual environments, and the extent to which these
experiences will improve learning, are the key aspects
which will determine whether VR has real benefits for
education. The similarity between the psychological

processes in virtual and real environments aids transfer
of learning. The fact that VR gives students the
opportunity to interactively manipulate learning
objects enables learner-specific constructions of
knowledge. In addition, the increased activity and
motivation towards learning induced by the VR
environment are all factors that impact the quality of
VR-related educational environments [33], [34], [35],
[36].
Osberg [37] suggests that “the fusion of
computers and telecommunications would lead to the
development of highly realistic virtual environments
that would be collaborative and interactive”. VR
education is usually used in areas where the
experiments are expensive or difficult to perform in
natural teaching and learning environments, or the
concepts being taught are difficult to understand using
normal textbook methods. The greatest potential for
VR usage in current learning environments is in areas
where real experiences are unavailable or impossible
to achieve. Osberg [38] describes this as “a sense of
immersion and inclusion in a virtual environment
which allows the learner an opportunity to interpret
and encode his or her perceptions in a broader, deeper
set of experiences than those existing in current
standard educational environments”. This sentiment is
paralleled by Jong-Heon [39] et al. in the examination
of VR technology to simulate physics learning
problems.

5. Instructional Experiences Using VR
Technology
Computer-aided instruction (CAI) has proven to
be beneficial to the learning process of students [40].
One of the benefits of CAI is that the individual is able
to control and become an active participant in the
learning process [41]. Virtual environments (VE’s)
could be considered a CAI instrument. VE’s offer
users the freedom to practice a given scenario at an
individual’s pace and repeat information when needed
[42] and are immersive and free the user from
distractions outside of the learning environment. VE’s
have proven to be beneficial as an instructional tool in
mainstream educational settings as well as being
beneficial in training and work-related environments
[43], [44]. Their immersive nature and ability to be
individualized is valuable in many educational
settings.
Given that user control is a benefit of instructional
technologies, VE’s can be an important aid in learning
because they inherently encompass user control.
Learners are able to understand what is taught and
why it is taught in a learner-centered scenario. By

allowing user control in the educational environment,
competence and mastery are promoted [45]. Learning
for understanding is important in any discipline,
computer graphics included, as it provides the mental
scaffolding needed for expertise development. VE’s
have been used to some extent in traditional education,
and in special education. Lester et al. [46] have
studied various attributes of virtual learning
environments that might assist students with problem
solving skills.
His group created a learning
environment containing a virtual pedagogical agent,
Herman the Bug, who assists in this learning process.
It was concluded that the virtual learning experience in
general was positive and that it reduced average
required time to complete assigned tasks. It was also
concluded that incorporation of a combination of both
verbal and visual cues to the user improves user
comprehension.

6. Visual Science as a Discipline
The authors believe that spatial abilities and
improving graphics instruction must be put into
context of the greater whole. One of the primary
reasons spatial visualization research and graphics
education has not advanced to a great extent over the
years, is the fact that graphics has not coalesced into a
discipline. Universities typically divide knowledge
into various disciplines and form colleges, schools or
departments for those disciplines that have common
attributes. Normally, the graphics disciplines are
scattered throughout the university. For example,
graphic design departments are sometimes located in
an art school or department; engineering graphics in
schools of engineering or technology. Even when
graphics is placed in departments, such as engineering,
the subject and the faculty are viewed as being
somehow different from the rest of the faculty and
discipline. The same could be said for graphics in
schools of technology and in schools of art. Graphics
is recognized as important in engineering, technology
and the arts, but not on the same level as other
disciplines within that school.
Approximately eighty percent of our sensory
input comes from our visual system. Much of what
we learn and experience is through our visual sense.
Much of our technological world could not exist
without the use of graphics to plan, produce, market,
and maintain goods and services.
There is a
tremendous amount of information that is associated
with producing good graphics.
Color theory,
projection theory, cognitive visualization, and
geometry are a few examples of what is needed to plan
and produce graphics.
Graphics is used to
communicate and store information, solve problems,

and affect the senses. Graphics is an integral part of
the human experience. Yet there is not a single
discipline that speaks with one voice and attempts to
bring order to the chaotic approach to graphics
education.
Graphics and all that it encompasses is a unique
body of knowledge that should be studied, practiced
and scientifically verified. This body of knowledge,
called visual science, can be defined, is significant,
and is mutually exclusive from other disciplines and
should be placed with the sciences as a secondary
domain of knowledge. The term graphic science is not
used because the word graphic by definition is limited
to text and pictures. The word visual was chosen
because it is a broader term that encompasses not only
text and pictures but anything that is seen or able to be
seen by the eye.
Visual science is defined as the study of the
processes that produce real images or images in the
mind. Visual science has at least three major
categories: geometry, spatial perception, and imaging
[47]. These three categories form the foundation for
any field of study related to the visual sciences. It is
within this context that visual learning takes place. As
people make sense of their surroundings through their
visual sense, they are able to assimilate and
accommodate new information with what they know
currently. This context is what provides a framework
for the scaffolding of expertise mentioned previously
[48]. Visual science will ultimately prove to have its
own unique knowledge base, research base, history,
and public perception. Computer graphics learning
environments, which take advantage of a learner’s
ability to quickly process and remember visual
information [49], will provide a context for the
development of the knowledge and research bases for
this emerging discipline.
