Abstract
Strategic problem-solving is a complicated task that
requires processing of large amount of information
using theoretical knowledge and practical experience.
Effective problem-solving requires fast and accurate
comprehension and analysis of the issues surrounding
the problem. There are several tools, techniques and
frameworks that support strategic analysis and
decision-making. This paper develops a framework to
clarify the relationship between visualization and
modelling, and offers a classification scheme for
visualization and modelling tools and techniques with
a perspective on strategic problem-solving.

1. Introduction
Businesses must have well-thought strategies to
stay competitive in a highly competitive market. While
the burden is on the shoulders of the managers, they
are surrounded by complexity (Figure 1). They receive
information in various forms including textual and
verbal communication, written data etc., and process
them again by mostly linear, sequential ways at the
best. They are required to process information poured
in front of them, clarify complexity and conceptualize
issues, define and structure specific problems, create
solution alternatives, evaluate and choose strategic
actions, and communicate these to their superiors and
subordinates for successful implementation. This
process not only requires a systematic method but also
tools to facilitate successful execution of each stage of
the problem-solving process.
The value of a manager is directly related to his
ability to make decision correctly. When the managers’
collective decisions are aggregated on the
macroeconomic scale, the value at stake becomes
significant. However, managers are human, and the
human intelligence is bounded by the limits of short-

term memory and processing capacity. Information
processing capability is limited by the: (1) working
memory, (2) speed of cognitive operations, (3)
retrieval of information, (4) numerical operations, (5)
projection in time and space [1]. The first constraint on
human intelligence, the short-term memory, is known
to handle a maximum of five to nine (seven plus or
minus two) chunks of information [2]. Hypothetically,
it is possible to pack together information and produce
meaningful chunks using visual representations
providing the brain with the capability to process a
larger amount of information at one time. As one
Chinese proverb says: “A picture is worth ten thousand
words” [3]. About the remainder of the constraints,
cognitive science literature points out the ability of the
human brain to process and analyze complex
information more effectively and much faster when
information is represented visually as opposed to
sequential textual or verbal forms alone [3].

Figure 1 Managerial Decision Making
Are managers alone out there in the jungle without
any tools and techniques to use in their strategic
analysis and problem-solving efforts? Not really, there
are various generic and special tools and techniques
available to improve the managerial thinking process
such as mind maps [4], rich pictures [5] and cognitive
maps [6]. In this paper, we first bring up the use of
problem-solving skills in the strategic context and
develop a framework to clarify the relationship

between modelling and visualization. After discussing
some of these tools and techniques, we point out to a
list of attributes that could be used to help decision
makers select appropriate tools.

2. Problem-solving
Problem-solving is the activity associated with
selecting an appropriate course of action to change the
present state to the desired state [7]. Recognition of the
existence of a problem is the first stage. Whereas some
problems are readily defined, others may require
imaginative observation. Thus, problems are classified
in three groups as well-structured, semi- structured and
ill-structured problems depending on the amount of
information available about the gap between the
present and desired state [7].
Several authors have commented on the stages of
problem-solving [8-11]. The general systems approach
to problem-solving steps are: (1) define the problem,
(2) identify alternative solutions, (3) evaluate
alternative solutions, (4) select the best alternative, (5)
implement the solution, (6) follow up to ensure
problem is solved. Visualization and visual modelling
tools and techniques are very useful in problem
conceptualization, definition, alternatives generation
and the communication of the solution.
There are two main approaches to problem-solving,
namely the hard systems methodology (HSM) and the
soft systems methodology (SSM) [9]. Operations
research (OR) and management science (MS)
techniques are classified under HSM.
HSM models a system (which behaves
problematically) using mathematics and aims to find
the optimal levels of the controllable variables (design
variables) quantitatively. With these characteristics,
HSM is very systematic in problem definition and
rigorous in the solution methods. Thus, HSM is
appropriate to model and solve well-defined problems
where the necessary information can be attained.
Defining variables in strategic problems, however,
is often subjective and difficult to quantify. SSM or
systems thinking on the other hand acknowledges the
limitations of models at the outset and aims to model
systems with the most sensible level of abstraction.
The following section discusses the characteristics of
the soft systems methodology in problem-solving.

development activity is sometimes its most useful
characteristic. SSM potentially improves memory, aids
analogical transfer of knowledge between different
academic or professional situations, supports mental
models, assists decision making and helps build
reusable experience [12].
Whereas formal logic is the mathematical study of
reasoning, critical thinking in systems theory is the
informal study of reasoning [13]. Critical systems
thinking draws upon both traditional systems thinking
and newer systems approaches by those who find hard
systems approach too limiting [14]. Systems theory
provides necessary modelling tools for capturing
critical thinking thought process and can be very
useful in strategic problem-solving, especially in
problem identification and root cause finding.
Strategic problem-solving requires a clear
understanding of the underlying system, which is
usually a complex one with several interrelated
variables. Systems thinking tools such as cognitive
mapping, rich pictures, influence diagrams and
decision trees are very useful in conceptualizing the
complicated management system under consideration.

3. Strategic Problem-Solving
Strategy formulation is a multi-stage process,
involving the understanding of complex and multidimensional
issues
ranging
from
product
conceptualization to delivering customer satisfaction.
There are different motivations that trigger the need for
a new or a modified strategy, such as the necessity to
respond to a change in the external environment, the
need to prepare in the anticipation of a change, or
simply to fill the gap between where the business
would like to be and where it is now. Consequently,
managerial decisions can be categorized as tactical,
strategic and visionary according to their time scale
character (Table 1).

consideration of a large number of interrelated issues.
Nonetheless,
all
executives
consciously
or
subconsciously deal with high-level strategic issues.
Pieces of information, issues related to problems, new
ideas, all reside in a manager’s mind.
There are difficulties in comprehending and
representing the complexity of the contents of strategy
and strategic problems. Bullet point lists and written
statements are often not sufficient clearly to
communicate complex and interrelated issues; neither
are they appropriate aids to discussing and analyzing
strategic issues within a management team.
“One cannot manage what he cannot model” [15].
Models are abstractions of reality created by using one
or a combination of graphical, mathematical, verbal or
physical forms. They are used to conceptualize
complex matters, analyze and solve problems since
experimenting with the real system is difficult or
simply infeasible. Verbal (textual) definitions and
mathematical models alone are not effective means in
strategic problem-solving due to the inherent
complexity of the problems. Issues such as causality,
correlations between variables, tradeoffs and
importance-priority characteristics of objectives etc.
are very difficult to comprehend when expressed in
words and formulae only. In addition, verbal
information transfer and processing is sequential.
Creating an all-inclusive conceptual perception of
strategic issues using sequential information
processing is not possible. Visual models on the other
hand can be either sequential or all-inclusive and can
provide a big-picture view. Visual descriptions
increase remembrance, support learning processes,
capture
attention,
structure
and
coordinate
communication and motivate people [15, 16]. They
help potentially explicable tacit (implicit) knowledge
to become explicit [17].
The term problem has a connotation for something
which has already happened that needs to be tackled.
In this restrictive perspective, only tactical decisions fit
in the field of problem-solving. However, whether the
problem exists readily or not, strategic analysis and
strategy development can benefit from general
problem-solving skills. With this perspective, we
consider problem-solving tools and techniques that has
a visual component to aid tactical, strategic and
visionary strategic decision making. The next section
develops a framework to understand the relationship
between modelling and visualization.

4. Visualization and Visual Modelling
Managers, consultants and academics continue to
adapt tools from different fields and develop novel
ones. However, it is not a straightforward task to find
an appropriate tool to suit the requirements of a
problem in consideration. There is a large number of
visual representation and modelling tools that can be
used in strategic analysis and problem-solving, and
more than one tool can be appropriate in a particular
situation either stand-alone or together with other
tools. It is therefore important to clarify the boundaries
and relationship between visualization and modelling
(Figure 2).

could be in the form of charts, plots, graphs, matrices
etc. Examples of Visual Modelling tools are cognitive
maps, semantic maps, concept maps and decision trees.
Integrated Visual and Mathematical Modelling tools
are visual representations incorporated in mathematical
forms, or vice versa. Decision tree analysis and system
dynamics are examples of integrated modelling tools.
This paper focuses on the tools and techniques in
visualization and in modelling where models have
visual characteristics:

4.1. Visual Representation of Information and
Data
There are different definitions of information
visualization and knowledge visualization in the
literature. Eppler and Burkhard [18] define knowledge
visualization as all graphic means that can be used to
develop or convey insights, experiences, methods or
skills and differentiate it from information
visualization which makes use of computer-supported,
interactive, visual representations of abstract data to
amplify cognition [19]. In this chapter, we use the term
information rather than knowledge to stress those tools
that help display what is already known, possibly in
pure data format, in a cognitively comprehensible
fashion.

Visual representations can be used to transfer,
create, learn, document, find or assess knowledge.
Data visualization is the graphical representation of
data to provide the viewer qualitative insight into the
data contents. Charts, graphs, plots and other visual
data representation tools help us make sense of a large
amount of data. Managers see many of these visual
representations in analysis reports and PowerPoint
presentations. Harris’ ‘Information Graphics’ [20] and
Zelazny’s [21] “Say it With Charts Workbook” are
good references on visual representations of data and
information.

related issues. These are of course small examples
chosen to demonstrate the ideas. In real problems, the
models can grow in size quite rapidly. However, one
should remember that choosing an appropriate level of
detail in the abstraction of the real system modelled is
key in effective management of models.

4.2. Visual Modelling
While visual representations display what is already
known, visual modelling systems are display-based
interactive problem-solving environments that support
the creative task of discovering and modelling the
structure of a complex problem. They provide the
capability for modelling the behaviour of a system
through time [22].
System thinking and creative problem-solving
literature make extensive use of visual modelling tools.
In this paper, we give examples of rich pictures and
cognitive mapping techniques. The rich pictures
method [5] has its origins in the soft systems
methodology (Figure 3). An effective rich picture (1)
includes structure, (2) includes process, (3) includes
concerns, (4) uses the appropriate language, and (5)
uses any pictorial or textual device that suits the
purpose [5]. They are mental maps and are better
suited in a managerial context since a sequential
check-list way of taking notes cannot show the links
between different issues.
Cognitive mapping [6, 23, 24] is another visual
model of one’s mental picture of an issue. Cognitive
mapping is a formal modelling technique with rules for
its development and may lead to later development of
influence diagrams [25] which can then be used to
build system dynamics models (stock and flow
diagrams) [6]. Managerial decision-making is almost
always a group activity. Group maps can be developed
by combining several cognitive maps derived from
each member of a problem-solving team. Cognitive
maps: (1) focus attention and trigger memory, (2) help
highlight key factors and priorities, (3) help supply
missing information, (4) can reveal gaps in information
or reasoning that need more direct attention [26]. Siau
and Tan discuss three cognitive mapping techniques
[26]: (1) causal mapping, (2) semantic mapping, (3)
concept mapping. The following figures demonstrate
examples of these mapping techniques using business

and Issue Trees in problem structuring and analysis
[10]. The logic tree is used to structure problems into
mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE)
subcomponents. The issue tree on the other hand is a
different version of a logic tree in which each branch
of the tree is an issue or question, and is used to lay out
the issues and subissues into a MECE visual
progression.

characteristics is developing a system dynamics model.
Sterman [29] states that simulation is essential to gain
insight into a system even if accurate quantitative
information about the systems’ parameters and the
functional relationships between the variables are not
available. This is because using only mental models
about a new strategy or policy, decision makers have
to make guesses of what the consequences of new
strategic actions would be which far exceed the
limitations of the cognitive abilities of human brain.
System dynamics can be used in various fields such
as strategy [29, 30], forecasting [31], project
management [32], product development [33],
insurance management [34], public policy, HIV
epidemic modelling, modelling human behaviour etc.
A single model is rarely enough to address all issues
related to a strategic problem and various modelling
techniques could be integrated for a more
comprehensive model. Lyons et al. [35] mention
system dynamics, agent-based modelling and
evolutionary game theory in the study of dynamic
systems. Vensim [36], Powersim [37], iThink and
Stella [38] are examples of commercial software for
system dynamics modelling.

can be used in visual modelling. One particular
decision support system (DSS) incorporates COPE
which is a cognitive mapping tool with SODA

methodology and V.I.S.A for multiple criteria decision
making [27]. While it is perfectly acceptable to use a
pen and paper, or Post-it© notes to develop visual
models, software can be handy in rapid development
and preservation of the knowledge created.

4.3. Integrated Visual and Mathematical
Modelling
Integrated visual and mathematical models make
use of visual representations but also facilitate
quantitative analysis on the system. The most famous
integrated modelling paradigm is System Dynamics
(SD). SD represents cause-effect relationships using
causal loop or stock-flow diagrams (Figure 7).
Wolstenholme [28] states that causal loop qualitative
system dynamics enhances linear and ‘laundry list’
thinking by introducing circular causality and
providing a medium by which people can externalize
mental models. Creating a mental map of problems or
systems are very useful but the human brain is limited
to understand temporal and spatial characteristics such
as feedbacks, time delays and nonlinearities. The next

potential events and outcomes of strategic decisions

making.

5. Classification of Tools and Techniques
Selecting an appropriate tool is important. There are
a multitude of attributes of the tools and techniques.
Decision makers should be aware of these attributes
before blindly using the most familiar one(s). For
instance, deterministic, analytical techniques may be
suitable for problems where the problem is welldefined, however same tools may limit creative
thinking in ill-defined or open-ended problems. As the
works of Gestalt Psychology suggest, not all visual
representations or models are good cognitively [41].
For instance, diagrams exceeding working memory
capacity are difficult to interpret [42]. A good diagram
(1) contains the right amount of information (not too
little, not too much), (2) provides quick information
retrieval, (3) passes on the message objectively, and
(4) conveys a clear and definitive message. Diagrams
can be supplemented with colour, mixed styles,
animation, text and vocal information. The attributes
above are not included in classification scheme that is
presented in this paper as these attributes are pertinent
to the application of the tools rather than the tools per
se.
Several researchers classified modelling and
visualization tools and techniques from different
perspectives. Turner [43] classifies tools as
frameworks, flowcharts, checklists, boxes, tables,
diagrams and graphical tools and statistics. Brady et al.
[44] classifies management tools as a document,
framework, procedure, system or method. Lohse et al.
[45] makes definitions for related terms such as tools,
techniques, procedures, processes, models, maps and

Lohse et al. [42] classifies visual representations as:
graphs, tables, maps, structure diagrams, process
diagrams, network charts, icons, graphic tables,
pictures, and time charts. In their experimental study,
they asked subjects their perspective on 60 different
visual representations and used the features such as
numeric-nonnumeric, continuous-discrete, attractiveunattractive, nontemporal-temporal, etc. for rating
[45]. Shehabuddeen et al. [47] focuses on matrix-based
tools and classifies them as matrices, grids, tables and
scored profiles. Burkhard [48-50] mentions four issues
that have to be considered for effective creation and
transfer of knowledge through visualization: (1) the
goal of using a visualization method, (2) the type of
knowledge need to be visualized, (3) characteristic of
the recipient (4) the best method to visualize this
indicator. Other ways of classifying could be by input
and output data, or by resource requirement in terms
of [51]: i) Physical resources: pen and paper based
methods, computer methods, whiteboard techniques
etc., ii) Time: the amount of effort required to
implement, iii) Skill: the amount of training or external
support needed to use the technique.
In an effort to evaluate tools with a comprehensive
set of attributes, we introduce a classification scheme
using characteristics from several areas that we
mentioned previously, such as problem-solving,
cognitive psychology, soft systems methodology etc.
Table 3 shows an example (not comprehensive) set of
tools, techniques and frameworks.
We believe that considering these attributes while
choosing a visual representation or modelling method
is vital to the success of the strategic problem-solving
activity. Managers, consultants and strategic decision
makers should strive to gain knowledge and expertise
in these and other and make use of visual
representations where appropriate.

6. Conclusion
Strategy formulation is a multi-stage process,
involving the understanding of complex and multidimensional issues. Visual representations and models
play a key role in successful strategic problem-solving.
This paper develops a framework to clarify the
relationship between visualization and modelling, and
offers a classification scheme for visualization and
modelling tools and techniques with a perspective on
strategic problem-solving.
