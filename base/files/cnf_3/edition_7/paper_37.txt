ABSTRACT

2. RELATEDWORK

Numerous segmentation and recognition
techniques have been proposed in literature for
Arabic OCR system. Correct and efficient
segmentation of Arabic text into characters is
considered to be a fundamental problem. While
OCR systems for other languages do not need
segmentation for printed text for successful
recognition, it is essential to design robust and
powerful segmentation algorithms or employ
segmentation free recognition schemes for
printed Arabic text. Even more, in recognition of
handwritten
characters, segmentation
is
considered to be indispensable. Most of current

pseudo-Segmentation of characters to small
strokes. The obtained strokes are further divided
into Overlapping parts and non-Overlapping
parts. The Non Overlapping parts are labeled and
ordered and a set of features are selected. The
geometrical and topological features of the
strokes are used for detecting the baseline and
for feature extraction. Next matching of
candidate character shapes to reference
prototypes is performed. The training procedure
is carried out to improve the recognition rate of
the system. Recognition is achieved by simple
to right analysis and matching to reference
prototypes. However the limitation is that, the
system is designed for single font and characters

1. INTRODUCTION
Printed Arabic text is like handwritten Latin text,
such that connection of characters is an inherent
property for Arabic script whether it is typed,
printed or handwritten. Most of errors and
deficiencies of Arabic recognition systems
comes from the segmentation stages.
Various segmentation algorithms have been
proposed in the literature. Given the vast number
of papers published on OCR, it is impossible to
include all the segmentation methods in this
survey. Instead we have made a representation
selection to illustrate the different principles that
can be used.

segmentation points within the characters.

to be recognized are of the same font as the
training set.
Almuallim and Yamaguchi [2] proposed a
structural recognition technique for Arabic
Handwritten words. Their system consists of 4
Phases: Preprocessing the text, Segmentation of
words into strokes, classification of strokes using
their geometrical and topological properties and
combining the strokes into the strings of
characters that represents the recognized word.
Since it is difficult to segment a cursive word to
letters, words are segmented into separate strokes
and classified as complementary characters,
strokes with a loop and strokes without a loop .
These strokes are further classified using their
geometrical and Topological properties. Finally
the relative positions of the classified strokes are
examined and the strokes are combined in
several steps into the string of characters that
represents the recognized word. System failures
in most cases are due to incorrect segmentation
of words.

and Berkani in
employed a
simple segmentation method. Their method is
based on the observation of projections of pixel
rows and columns, and uses these projections to
guide the segmentation process. They start by
segmenting the image horizontally into separate
lines. Then, each line is segmented vertically to
separate
The previous two steps are
mainly achieved through observing the rows or
columns that have no black pixels. Afterwards,

it is scanned in order
to estimate the start and end points of separate
characters. Like in their method,
segmentation, which is a common problem
shown in Figure 1, is treated by considering the
entire under-segmented set of characters as a
single character. On the other hand, the other
common problem of over-segmentation is solved
by taking care of the situations in which it may
occur and resolve them accordingly.

Al-Yousefi and Udpa [4] introduced a
Statistical Approach for the Recognition of
Arabic Characters. The character is segmented to
Primary and secondary parts. Secondary parts are
then isolated and identified separately and
moments of horizontal and vertical projections of
the primary parts are computed. Finally a
Statistical classification approach is used to
classify the characters.

The word is divided to a series of curves by
determining their start and endpoints of words.
Whenever outer contour changes sign from
positive to negative a character is segmented.

adopted a
multifont technique for segmenting Arabic text.
The Technique is divided to 4 major steps. First
the image is scanned and is transformed to a
binary image. Next the image is preprocessed to
remove any noise associated with the image. In
the third stage the skeleton of the image is traced
from
to right using a 3 x 3 window and a
binary tree is constructed. Freeman code is
constructed to describe skeleton code. Finally the
binary tree is segmented to subtree such that
each subtree describes a character in the binary
image. This technique overcomes the problem of
under segmentation and over segmentation of the

However this technique fails for Overlapping
Characters. As shown in the Figure 2 when the
two characters overlap the algorithm fails.

without prior segmentation. The technique is
based on describing symbols in terms of shape
primitives. At recognition time, the primitives
are detected on a word image using mathematical
morphology operations. The system then
matches the detected primitives with symbol
models. This leads to spatial arrangements of the
matched symbol models. The system conducts a
search in the space of spatial arrangements of
models and outputs the arrangement with the
highest probability as the recognition of the
word.

To improve segmentation efficiency we
opted to remove stress marks like dots from
characters. Their original position is remembered
and reintroduced only in the recognition phase.
In order to remove dots from subword, we have
employed connected component approach with 8
neighbors.

Other segmentation techniques in the
literature include the segmentation of text to

3. PROPOSED APPROACH FOR
SEGMENTATION
In our project for Arabic OCR system, after
applying preprocessing techniques, horizontal
and vertical segmentations are employed to
segment a page into separate lines and lines into
sub-words respectively. Arabic characters are
connected on the baseline. In order to dissect
sub-word into characters, we exploit the fact that,
junction point between connected characters lies
at baseline as shown in fig. 2.2. But in certain
cases like case of an isolated
it will suffer
from "over segmentation", in other cases, some
words may have overlapping characters such as
"and thus suffer from "under segmentation" as
in Fig. 2.1. Even some segmentation techniques,
might work for one font but fail to segment
words if font type or
changed. We have
developed a general technique, which is
independent of font size and font type.

After performing above mentioned steps, an
image E with several guide bands is obtained. In
order to select, correct guide band for sub-word
dissection, we extract several features from each
guide band:

4. DISCUSSION
This segmentation scheme has been implemented
in a
environment. Results are quite
promising. Few points are still under
investigation:

[2]

The problem of character overlapping
for some Arabic fonts causes some
under segmentation of some characters
like the special character
composed

[3]

[4]

2. The problem of ligature for Arabic
traditional font generates also under
segmented characters.
These problems can be solved by considering
some group of characters that always appear
together in a special form, as a separate class.
Some other miss-segmentation will be dealt with
in the recognition stage. The segmentation is not
an aim by
some characters can be
classified in a first run during the segmentation
process by simple matching. Arabic words are
sometimes composed of groups of connected and
non connected portions that we refer to as
words. Sub-words can be composed of one or
more characters. So segmentation of sub-words
is applied only to those sub-words that are
composed of more than one character..

5. CONCLUSION
In this paper an efficient segmentation of printed
Arabic text into characters is considered. As
segmentation and recognition are closely
dependent of each other, and segmentation is not
an aim by itself, our approach defers the ligature
problem to the recognition phase. In this paper,
we have proposed a new
segmentation
scheme, which is independent of font size and
font type.
