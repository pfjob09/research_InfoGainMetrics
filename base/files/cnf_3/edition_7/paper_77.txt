Abstract
Broadcasting is the problem of dissemination of information in which one piece of information needs to be transmitted to a group of individuals connected by an interconnection network. A widely accepted communication model
for this problem is the 1-port, constant model, in which a
node of the network can transmit the message only to one
neighbor at a time, and the transmission time is constant,
regardless the length of the message. Finding an optimum
strategy for broadcasting under this model, such that this
process is accomplished in minimum time, has been proved
to be NP-complete, for an arbitrary network.
If we model the interconnection network as an undirected
graph, the minimum broadcast time function associates to
each vertex an integer which represents the minimum time
necessary to broadcast the information stored in that vertex
to all other vertices. The values of the minimum broadcast time function are known for a very restricted class of
graphs, mainly regular ones, and very little is known about
this function in general.
In this paper we explore two new properties of this function. The ﬁrst property establishes a connection between
this function and the behavior of the optimal broadcast
schemes. We prove an exact result for trees and we conjecture it for arbitrary graphs. The second property establishes a connection between this function and the density of
the graph.
Keywords: broadcasting, minimum broadcast time, broadcast function, maximum diameter.

1. Introduction
Broadcasting is the problem of dissemination of information in an interconnection network in which, one member, called originator, knows a piece of information and has
to transmit it to all other members of the network. The minimum broadcast time problem consists in ﬁnding a strategy,
for a given graph G and an originator v, such that the broadcast time of v is minimized. This problem ﬁnds applications
in parallel and distributed computing, Internet messaging,
rumors and virus spreading, etc.
Different communication models have been proposed
and analyzed for this problem. In this paper we consider
the 1-port, constant time model. That is, once a member
of the network knows the information, he can transmit it
only to one neighbor at a time, and the transmitting time is
constant.
We model the interconnected network as a simple undirected connected graph G (V, E), in which the members of
the network are the vertices of G, and the communication
lines, the edges of G. Given such a graph G and an originator v ∈ V , the minimum broadcast time function, shortly
the b-function, is deﬁned as b : V → N, such that b (v)
represents be the minimum time necessary to inform all the
vertices of G, starting from v. The broadcast time of G is
deﬁned as b (G) = max { b (v)| v ∈ G}.
The minimum broadcast time problem has been proved
to be NP complete [9], even for bounded degree graphs
[2]. Good surveys on broadcasting can be found in [3] and
[4]. The values of the minimum broadcast time function are
known for a very restricted class of graphs, mainly regular
ones, and very little is known about this function in general.
In this paper we investigate the connection between the
values of the b-function and the behavior of the optimal

broadcast schemes. We prove that this new property of the
b-function is always true for arbitrary trees and we conjecture it for arbitrary graphs. Based on this property we managed to exhibit an iterative global algorithm for minimum
broadcast time problem which performs very well in practice (see [5] for a detailed description of this algorithm and
comparative results).
Due to the NP-completeness, some heuristic algorithms
have been developed, in order to give an approximate solution for this problem (see [5] for further references). There
are two main criteria to compare these heuristics: the complexity of the algorithm and the “optimality” of the solution. Since the ﬁrst criterion is relatively easy to compute,
the second one raises some questions, especially for random generated graphs, for which an optimal solution is generally not known a priory. There are three approaches to
overcome this problem: to obtain theoretical results regarding the inapproximability of the problem, to run the algorithm on graphs with known broadcast time, mainly regular
ones, or to do benchmarks on random graphs, generated using common generators [5, 6, 7]. Two main parameters of
the random graph generators are the number of vertices and
the density of the graph. In this paper we establish a connection between the minimum broadcast time function and
these two parameters by upper bounding the range in which
the b-function can take values.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
the ﬁrst property, Section 3 describes the second property,
and Section 4 draws the conclusions. The deﬁnitions will
be given in the places where they are used. Throughout this
paper we assume that the graphs are connected.

2. The b-function and optimal broadcast
schemes
We denote by G = (V, E) an undirected graph with
V the set of vertices and E the set of edges. If we consider the broadcasting process originated in vertex v, at
time-slot t, one already informed vertex, say u, will choose
one of its uninformed neighbors, say w, and will transmit
the information to w. Therefore, a broadcast scheme will
assign to each vertex and time slot another vertex to inform. Therefore, we can associate to an optimal broadcast
scheme originated in v a function Bv : (V, Γ) → V , where
Γ = {1, ..., b (G)}, such that Bv (u, t) = w if and only if
vertex u will transmit to vertex w at time t in that optimal
broadcast scheme started from v.
The crux of an optimal broadcast scheme is the way of
choosing the next neighbor to inform. If we denote by
Nv (u, t) the set of uninformed neighbors of vertex u in
graph at time-slot t in a broadcast scheme originated in
v, the following theorem establishes a connection between

the minimum broadcast time function and optimal broadcast schemes, for arbitrary trees.

Figure 1. Tree T and the subtrees generated
by u, w, and z.

Theorem 1 Consider a tree T , an originator vertex v,
and the b-function deﬁned for each vertex of T . During any optimal broadcast scheme starting from v, at any
time t, an informed vertex u will call vertex z, that has
the minimum b-function among all uniformed neighbors
of u. More formally, Bv (u, t) = z implies b (z) =
min {b (Nv (u, t − 1))} .
Proof:
Let u be an informed vertex at time-slot t − 1. Assume, by contradiction, that vertex u will call at timeslot t one of its children, say w, with a greater broadcast
time then z, which has the smallest broadcast time among
all uninformed neighbors of u. Formally, we assume by
contradiction that Bv (u, t) = w and b (w) > b (z) =
min {b (Nv (u, t − 1))}.
We denote by Tw the subtree induced by w, and by Tz the
subtree induced by z, both in an optimal broadcast scheme
having v as originator. We denote by Tu = T − Tw − Tz ,
the tree remaining after deleting Tw and Tz from T , rooted
in u (see Figure 1). Also, we denote by:

• b (w → Tw ) the minimum time needed for w to broadcast in subtree Tw
• b (z → Tz ) the minimum time needed for z to broadcast in subtree Tz
• b (u → Tu ) the minimum time needed for u to broadcast in subtree Tu

There are 13 possible relationships between
b (w → Tw ), b (z → Tz ), and b (u → Tu ), with respect to “<” and “=”. These 13 possibilities can be grouped
in six cases:
a) b (z → Tz ) = b (w → Tw ) = b (u → Tu )
b (u → Tu ) < b (w → Tw ) = b (z → Tz )
In these cases b (w) = b (z) (contradiction).

Conjecture Given an undirected connected graph G, an arbitrary originator v, and a label attached to each vertex corresponding to its minimum broadcast time, during an optimal broadcast process starting from v, an informed vertex
will always call one uniformed neighbor with the smallest
label.

b) b (u → Tu ) < b (z → Tz ) < b (w → Tw )
b (z → Tz ) < b (u → Tu ) < b (w → Tw )
In these cases we have:
b (w) b (w → Tw ) + 1, and
b (z) b (w → Tw ) + 2
Adding we get b (w) + 1 b (z) (contradiction).

3. The b-function and the graph density
Some heuristics, developed to approximately solve the
minimum broadcast time problem, have been tested on random graphs. Since most of the random graph generators
have as main parameters the number of vertices and the
density of the graph, we considered opportune to study the
relationship between the b-function and these two parameters. More precisely, considering vertex v having the smallest broadcast time bmin , and vertex w having the greatest
broadcast time bmax , we give an upper bound for the difference bmax − bmin , in terms of graph density ρ and the
number of vertices n.

c) b (u → Tu ) = b (z → Tz ) < b (w → Tw )
In this case we have:
b (w) b (w → Tw ) + 1, and
b (z) b (w → Tw ) + 1
Adding we get b (w) b (z) (contradiction).
d) b (z → Tz ) < b (w → Tw ) < b (u → Tu )
b (w → Tw ) < b (z → Tz ) < b (u → Tu )
b (w → Tw ) = b (z → Tz ) < b (u → Tu )
In these cases we have either:
b (w) = b (z) = b (u → Tu ) + 1, or
b (w) = b (z) = b (u → Tu ) + 2 (contradiction).

Deﬁnition 1 For an undirected graph G = (VG , EG ) on n
vertices and m edges, the graph density ρ is deﬁned by:

e) b (z → Tz ) < b (w → Tw ) = b (u → Tu )
In this case:
b (w) b (w → Tw ) + 2, and
b (z) b (w → Tw ) + 2
Adding we get b (w) b (z) (contradiction).
f) b (u → Tu ) < b (w → Tw ) < b (z
b (w → Tw ) < b (u → Tu ) < b (z
b (w → Tw ) = b (u → Tu ) < b (z
b (w → Tw ) < b (u → Tu ) = b (z
All these cases imply that:

b (w → Tw ) < b (z → Tz )

designed an iterative global heuristic in order to ﬁnd the
minimum broadcast time function, which works very well
in practice [5]. All these results convinced us to make the
following conjecture.

Although the result of the following lemma seems to be
somehow trivial, it turns out to be helpful to our study.
Lemma 1 If there is an edge between vertices v and w in
graph, then |b (v) − b (w)| 1.
(1)

Inequality (1) shows that that u cannot call w before z
since the obtained broadcast scheme will not be optimal.
More formally, b (w → Tw ) < b (z → Tz ) ⇒ Bv (u, t) =
w.
Note that the converse is not true. That is, b (z) =
min {b (Nv (z, t − 1))} does not imply Bv (u, t) = z,
since there may be another vertex y such that b (y) =
min {b (Nv (z, t − 1))} and Bv (u, t) = y.
The same property as in Theorem 1 can be similarly
proven for a path Pn or for the product graph P2 × Pn . We
have explored a large variety of small irregular graphs with
known broadcast scheme without ﬁnding any counterexample to this property. Also, based on this property, we have

Proof: Less formally, Lemma 1 claims that the minimum
broadcast time of two adjacent vertices cannot differ by
more than one.
Without loss of generality, assume that b (v) > b (w) and
b (v) − b (w) > 1, which implies Bv (v, 1) = w. Considering a new broadcast scheme B in which v is calling w in the
ﬁrst time-slot, B (v, 1) = w. After this call, we can follow
the broadcast scheme having w as originator. We obtain for
v a broadcast time b (v) = b (w) + 1 < b (v). This contradicts the deﬁnition of b (v) as being the minimum broadcast
time for v.
This lemma has a straightforward corollary, which
bounds |b (v) − b (w)| for two arbitrary vertices v and w
in graph, in terms of graph’s diameter.

Corollary 1 Given a graph G (V, E) with diameter D,
|b (v) − b (w)| D, for any v, w ∈ V .
Using this corollary we can now bound the range in
which the minimum broadcast function can take values.

for any v, w ∈ V .
Proof:
By Corollary 1, we have transformed the problem of upper bounding bmax − bmin in the problem of upper bounding the diameter of the graph in terms of graph density and
number of vertices. This problem has been considered in
[8] and later in [1], in a slightly different context. Since
we are looking for a closed formula for the maximum diameter of a graph function of the number of vertices and
the graph density, we will use Theorem 3.1 from [8], which
gives an upper bound for the number of edges of a graph
mmax , given the diameter D, and the number of vertices n:
mmax

(3)

In order to apply this result, we have to introduce the diameter critical graphs: a graph G is called diameter critical
if the addition of any edge decreases the diameter (Figure
2).
Ore proved in [8] that the upper bound from (3) is attained for diameter critical graphs. Therefore, given a graph
with n vertices and m edges, the maximum possible diameter, Dmax , satisﬁes the following inequalities:

Since the left side of the interval from (7) is opened, we
obtain the following formula for the maximum diameter of
a graph:

(10)

If we substitute m = ρn (n − 1) /2 in (10) we obtain the
claimed bound.
Observation
The upper bound from Theorem 2 is tight by an additive factor of 2. This can be proved by ﬁnding a graph for
which bmax − bmin = D − 2. We can draw such a graph
by joining the extremity of a path on n1 vertices with the
center of a star on n2 vertices (see Figure 3). It can be seen
that if n1 is smaller than the number of neighbors of v then
b (v) − b (w) = (n1 + n2 − 1) − n2 = n1 − 1 = D − 2.

4. Conclusions
In this paper we explore two new properties of the minimum broadcast time function. The ﬁrst property establishes
a connection between the values of this function and the
behavior of the optimal broadcast schemes. We prove an

is the ﬁrst iterative approach to an NP-complete problem.
This opens the possibility to apply the same technique to
other NP-complete problems, in which, starting from an instance and an approximate solution, to be able to ﬁnd a better solution. The second property of the minimum broadcast function described in this paper establishes a connection between the values of this function and the density of
the graph. We also prove that the obtained upper bound is
tight by an additive factor of two.
