Abstract
Case studies are proposed as a research method on
knowledge visualization that can deal with the
multidisciplinarity, the large variety of research
targets and the complex correlations of this type of
information visualization utilized for supporting tasks
of knowledge management. A suitable case structure is
presented that documents the analyzed cases and
allows for a comparative analysis of multiple cases. To
be able to systematically evaluate and compare the
applied visualization techniques a set of evaluation
criteria is introduced.
Keywords--- knowledge visualization, information
visualization, knowledge management, case study.

1. Introduction
Information visualization helps knowledge workers
in creation, verification and presentation of knowledge
as well as sharing knowledge with others. For example,
it assists them in understanding social relationships,
financial trends, document library development, and
much more [1]. There are several types of information
visualizations available [2] [3]. Shneiderman proposes
key principles for the success of information
visualization that are based on his Visual InformationSeeking Mantra: Overview first, zoom and filter, then
details-on-demand [4]. These principles can also be
applied to visualization techniques utilized for
performing tasks of knowledge management – denoted
as knowledge visualization (KV).
Eppler
and
Burkhard
define
knowledge
visualization as the use of visual representations to
improve the creation and transfer of knowledge
between at least two persons [5]. Knowledge
visualization integrates results from information
visualization, cognitive art, communication science,
information architecture and knowledge management
[6]. It is an emerging discipline of information

visualization – respectively an interdisciplinary
approach – and still has to be defined and established.
However, it is not completely new and, for example,
has been applied in the field of cognition and learning
and instruction for some time [7].
To identify the specific requirements of knowledge
management on visualization a case study based
approach has been chosen. Case study research is a
frequently used research method in knowledge
management. With the help of case studies a great
variety of different research targets as well as complex
correlations can be analyzed. Knowledge visualization
tackles several disciplines, its boundaries are not
evident and there are complex correlations. Thus, case
studies have been identified as an appropriate research
approach. As an additional benefit they have proven to
be vitally important as repository in a continuous
process of research and as a utility to document a large
diversity of experiences gained in practical studies.
In this paper the author will present how case
studies can be used as a research method on knowledge
visualization. A structure for case studies is proposed
that helps to gain insights and identify the specific
requirements of knowledge management on
visualization, and to point out its benefits.
Section 2 gives a brief overview on case study
research and introduces an appropriate case structure.
Section 3 presents criteria for identifying the supported
tasks of managing knowledge and for evaluating the
applied visualization technique. In section 4 some of
the analyzed cases are briefly presented.

2. Case studies on knowledge visualization
The case study methodology can often be found in
the literature since it has a broad applicability.
However, there exist different kinds of case studies –
according to the underlying research design. Research
on information and knowledge visualization implies
specific needs to case based research that will be
presented in this paper.

2.1. Research cases
According to Yin [8] “A case study is an empirical
inquiry that:
 investigates a contemporary phenomenon within
a real-life context, especially when
 the boundaries between phenomenon und context
are not clearly evident.”
Case studies are often used when “how” or “why”
questions are being posed. Such “exploratory” case
studies can be complemented by “explanatory” and
“descriptive” case studies. Each of those approaches
can be either single or multiple case studies where a
multiple design must follow a replication rather than
sampling logic [8].
In exploratory case studies, fieldwork, and data
collection may be undertaken prior to definition of the
research questions and hypotheses. Nevertheless, the
framework of the study must be created at first. Crucial
to the quality of research is the selection of cases. [9]
Explanatory cases are suitable for doing causal
studies. In complex and multivariate cases, the analysis
can make use of pattern-matching techniques. [9]
Descriptive cases require that the investigator starts
with a descriptive theory. This type of study depends
on the formation of hypotheses of cause-effect
relationships. Thus, the descriptive theory must cover
the depth and scope of the case under study.
Yin proposes six illustrative structures that can be
used by authors for case study composition: linearanalytical, comparative, chronological, theorybuilding, “suspense” and unsequenced structures [8].
Most commonly used is the linear-analytical structure
where “the sequence of subtopics involves the issue or
problem being studied, a review of the relevant prior
literature, the methods used, the findings from the data
collected and analyzed, and the conclusions and
implications from the findings” [8].
The case structure proposed in this paper follows
the linear-analytical structure that is applied to
descriptive case studies.

2.2. Requirements of case studies on KV
Case study based research on knowledge
visualization was performed as part of a project on
knowledge and management that investigates the
handling of knowledge in complex organisations.
Amongst other approaches, case studies serve as a
means of identifying the requirements of organisations,
their approaches to this new and complex topic and
their achievements on implementing knowledge
management.
To support this goal the author has chosen cases in
information visualization that support typical problems

in knowledge management that will often be applied in
organisations of interest, e.g. for tasks in knowledge
acquisition and knowledge identification, interactive
search and navigation in complex knowledge spaces,
for the exploration of large hierarchically structured
document collections, for visualization of knowledge
maps or of large structures like Wikis. Section 4 will
present a small selection of such cases.

2.3. Case study structure
To answer the questions of interest the author has
set up a case study structure based on the lineranalytical model. As Yin proposes [8], the case study is
made up of sections on the problem being studied, a
review of related research and relevant literature on the
problem being studied, specific topics on the case
study method used, a detailed description of the
application, a discussion of the findings and a
conclusion.
The detailed description of the application (the
underlying case) is composed of
1. a description of the business environment where
the visualization is applied, i.e. goals and
benefits, users, method of problem solving,
workflows, achieved results,
2. an analysis of the knowledge management task
that is supported by visualization (see 3.1),
3. facts on the visualization tool (i.e., manufacturer,
system requirements, features, scope of supply
and services),
4. a detailed evaluation of the visualization
technique (see 3.2).
Several cases are analyzed using the same structure,
thus resulting in a compilation of case studies – termed
comparative structures by Yin [8]. Therefore, criteria
for evaluating the different approaches had to be
established. Whereas the case descriptions on the
business environment and the facts on the visualization
tool did not have to follow a strict structure, the
sections on the knowledge management task and the
applied visualization techniques required a more
systematic approach.

3. Evaluation criteria
3.1. Knowledge management task
Among the variety of concepts on knowledge
management [10] it was found that the building blocks
of knowledge management, as proposed by Probst,
Raub and Romhardt [11], to be most appropriate. This
model is made up of an inner cycle and an outer cycle
including feedback. The inner cycle consists of the

building blocks of knowledge identification,
knowledge acquisition, knowledge development,
knowledge distribution, knowledge preservation and
use of knowledge. An outer-cycle consists of theses
activities plus the setting of knowledge goals and
knowledge measurement [12].
These building blocks represent activities that are
directly related to knowledge. The author’s aim was to
determine “where” and “how” visualization supports
the handling of knowledge in the analyzed cases. Thus,
for each case at first the concerned building blocks
were determined. Then the applied visualization
techniques were identified.
After compiling a number of case studies it turned
out that most visualization tools support knowledge
identification, knowledge acquisition, knowledge
preservation and knowledge use. Additionally a
correlation between building blocks and visualization
techniques & tools can be derived, e.g., that knowledge
identification is often based on knowledge maps and
visualizations of semantic nets or hierarchical trees.

3.2. Evaluation of visualization techniques
The fourth section of the detailed description of the
cases addresses more technical terms concerning the
visual representation of knowledge and interaction
issues.
At first the aim of the visualization is analyzed and
the benefits due to the application of visualization to
the problem dealt with are determined. The kind of
knowledge tool that is used is identified and described.
There exist a variety of knowledge tools that are
used in knowledge management to perform specific
tasks: e.g., knowledge map, concept map, competency
map, semantic net, etc. For each of these knowledge

tools there exist a number of visualisation techniques
that can be applied. For example, a knowledge map
might be visualized by Cone Trees, Hyperbolic Trees,
Mindmaps or Treemaps. Thus, in the first step the
applied knowledge tool and the corresponding
visualization technique are determined.
In the second step the visual representation by itself,
e.g., the spatial organization of data, the data density,
or information coding, is evaluated. The author adapted
an approach proposed by Freitas, Luzzardi, et al. [13]
to derive a set of criteria that can be applied to all
cases.
The following criteria are used to evaluate the
visual representation:
 characteristics of data
 cognitive complexity
 spatial organization
 information coding
 state transition
 limitations
Users interact with the visual representation by
navigating in visual structures, changing views or
manipulating the data set. The following criteria are
used to evaluate these interaction mechanisms [13]:
 orientation
 navigation
 data set manipulation
Finally the expressiveness and the effectiveness of
the visualization technique are analyzed [14].
3.2.1. Characteristics of data These facts are
determined by type (e.g., text, files, relations) and
format of data (e.g., file format), the type of variables
(i.e., nominal, ordinal, quantitative) and other attributes
like metadata (e.g., keywords, title, author, creation
date).
3.2.2. Cognitive complexity The cognitive complexity
of a visual representation can be measured by data
dimension and data density. The dimension of data is
identified by the number of dimensions simultaneously
displayed. Data can be 1-, 2-, 3-dimensional, or multidimensional. One of these dimensions can also be a
temporal dimension. Data might have a tree structure
or be a network of data. [2]
Data density refers to the amount of data in a given
area of data space which, for example, can be
measured by the number of points in a graph or the
number of data elements per volume element.
Additionally the relevance of the displayed
information and the support of cognitive processes are
analyzed.

3.2.5. State transition After performing user actions
parts or the entire visual representation have to be
rebuilt. The perception of information is affected by
the time required for the generation of the new image
and the changes in visual/spatial organization [13].

3.2.8. Navigation While exploring knowledge spaces
users have to be provided with easy means of
navigation and querying for specific information.
Features that are analyzed are support in selecting a
data element, changing and manipulating the point of
view, the manipulation of the representation of data
elements, expanding (and shrinking) of hidden data
elements. They should be complemented by tools for
searching and querying for specific information. [13]

Figure 2. Overview on evaluation criteria
3.2.3. Spatial organization The spatial organization of
data concerns the layout of the visual representation
indicated by the location and distribution of
information elements in the display. An information
element should be easily located which is affected if
the layout does not follow a logical organization and if
objects are occluded by others. Thus, the quality of
object location can be measured by the degree of
occlusion of objects and the logical order. [13]
The user has to be aware of the overall distribution
of information elements in the visual representation
and how they are arranged. While showing details of
an element the reference context (e.g., supported by
aids of orientation) should also be displayed [13].
3.2.4. Information coding While mapping data
elements in data tables to visual structures (according
to the reference model for visualization) the spatial
substrate is augmented by marks, graphical properties
and additional symbols to encode information [2].
Thus, on evaluating the visual representation the
methods of information coding (e.g., types of symbols,
color coding) are analyzed.

3.2.9. Data set manipulation While dealing with
complex representations the amount of presented
information has to be controlled. Filtering helps to
reduce the information shown. Clustering allows to
group a subset of data and to represent it by special
symbols. Pruning cuts of irrelevant information.
3.2.10. Expressiveness and effectiveness An
expressive visual representation encodes all relevant
information and only that information in the visual
structure. An effective visual representation presents
all information clearly in view of visualization aims. It
is more effective if it is faster to interpret, can convey
more distinctions, or leads to fewer errors on
interpretation. [2] [14]

4. The cases
The introduced case study structure can be applied
to a variety of cases on knowledge visualization. Two
of them shall be presented in brief. Other cases, for
example, have been InfoSky, a tool for exploring large,
hierarchically structured document collections [15], or
the WikiBrowser by TouchGraph for visualizing Wikis
[16]. In the initial phase of case study research the
selection of cases war primarily driven by the
availability of in-depth information.
All case studies are descriptive cases that are based
on the linear-analytical structure.

4.1. netzspannung.org
The case study netzspannung.org addresses an
approach on structuring a heterogeneous information
stock represented by a semantic net. netzspannung.org
is an internet platform for artistic production, media
projects, and intermedia research that acts as an
information pool for artists, designers, computer
scientists and cultural scientists [17].
Among the various interfaces for visualizing digital
archives available at netzspannung.org the project
cast01 – a conference on Living in Mixed Realities –
has been analyzed in detail using a descriptive case
study based on the linear-analytical structure.
The Semantic Map is an interface that structures and
visualizes heterogeneous content according to semantic
criteria by building clusters of related content on the
basis of their semantic relationships. It provides the
user with different possibilities for "rummaging
through" the platform's databases to discover content
and connections. [17]

By interactively exploring the visual representation
that visualizes a semantic net and by navigating in
visual structures new insights and relations can be
identified. A detailed analysis of the visualization
techniques that is based on the set of criteria introduced
in section 3.2 has shown the Semantic Map as an easy
to use, effective visualization.

4.2. BibTechMon™
BibTechMon™ is a tool for technology monitoring
that has been developed by the Austrian Research
Centers (ARC) [18]. Technology monitoring is
concerned with evaluating the enormous amounts of
data included in patents, scientific journals and internal
corporate documentation. On the basis of
multidimensional bibliometric methods of analysis,
and with the support of co-occurrences and cluster
analysis, BibTechMon™ recognizes the interrelation of
keywords in all the excerpts to be examined. [18]

Figure 4. BibTechMon™ detail
Figure 3. Semantic Map
In terms of knowledge management based on the
building blocks of KM (section 3.1) the Semantic Map
is used for knowledge identification, knowledge
development and knowledge preservation. Besides the
visualization of heterogeneous content it can also be
seen as part of a system of knowledge maps that helps
to reproduce implicit knowledge structures of
communities of experts. As a tool for knowledge
discovery based on semantic relations it helps to
explore a large heterogeneous information stock. The
semantic approach stimulates the integration of
separated knowledge bases thus contributing to
knowledge development. Due to its function as an
archive it also serves for knowledge preservation.

The results of the bibliometric analysis are
converted into visual representations that can be
analyzed and interpreted intuitively by users, supported
by
an
interactive
interface.
BibTechMon’s
visualization is based on structural maps of knowledge.
The ontology is visually represented as a network
diagram. The size of a node indicates the frequency of
occurrence of the keyword, the thickness of the relation
indicates the relative frequency of the combined
occurrence of two keywords, and spatial proximity
indicates the amount of similarity.
BibTechMon™ primarily aims at knowledge
identification by using a knowledge map with circular
shape that illustrates the data elements (e.g., keywords
found in patents or scientific publications) as nodes
and their relations. Additionally, the knowledge map of
BibTechMon™ supports knowledge acquisition,

knowledge use and knowledge preservation. The
visualization technology meets most of the proposed
evaluation criteria sufficiently. For example, it
provides different aids for object location and spatial
orientation and allows the user to navigate in the
knowledge map with various interaction methods.

Conclusion and future work
A case study based approach to knowledge
visualization helps to achieve quick advances to a
complex research area. It has proven to be suitable for
research on such an interdisciplinary topic. By defining
a strict structure for the research cases and by
providing a set of evaluation criteria to follow, the
comparability of the individual cases can be ensured –
thus gaining higher significance and expressiveness of
the results.
Due to the chosen method a systematic coverage of
all applications of knowledge visualization cannot be
achieved. However, this is not the intent of case-study
based research. In the first step the focus on selecting a
research case was based on the availability of in-depth
information about the case and especially the
knowledge management task to be supported. In the
next stage of ongoing research the subjects of research
have to be spread more carefully to cover the most
important and frequently used visualization techniques
focused on knowledge management – thus gaining a
more systematic coverage of the field.
The evaluation criteria presented in section 3.2
proved to be representative and appropriate. However,
to allow for conclusions on the quality of the applied
visualization tools and rankings a weighted model of
criteria and sub-criteria has to be developed.
