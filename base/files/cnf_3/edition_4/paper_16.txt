the zoomable visualizations. In the indented list
paradigm, each node appears below its parent indented to
the right; Microsoft Windows Explorer (WE), Linux
Konqueror and Nautilus are a few common examples.
Zoomable user interfaces (ZUI) allow the user to zoom
in or out of a specific hierarchy part (e.g., Grokker [3];
the zoomable paradigm is also adopted by multiple
implementations in windowing environments). In some
evaluations, the indented list approach has been reported
to have the best performance in the majority of the cases,
thus it is considered as a baseline method in many
visualization evaluations. The indented list success has
been partially attributed to user familiarity with it.
This work is an attempt to further explore the issue
of file browsing visualizations and the indented list paradigm in particular, based on existing hierarchy evaluations and an interview-based user study. The user study
records user browsing habits in the context of PIM, to
provide further insight on how to improve existing file
browsing visualizations.
The following section presents related work and
further explains the motivation for this work. Section 3
describes the user study group and method, while section

Abstract
Hierarchically structured data collections often need
to be visualized for the purposes of digital information
management and presentation. File browsing, in particular, has an inherent hierarchical structure and plays
an important role in the context of Personal Information
Management (PIM). A multitude of file browsers are
nowadays available, offering different functionalities,
while users adopt diverse practices and habits for
browsing activities. In this paper, we investigate these
aspects to obtain insights into their advantages and disadvantages and suggest solutions in the area of PIM, as
well as in other domains employing similar visualization
paradigms. The presented study focuses on the two most
widespread visualizations used by file browsers, the
indented list and zoomable interface paradigms, and
assesses their effectiveness for various tasks and contexts, both by exploiting results on existing evaluations
on hierarchy visualizations and folder hierarchy visualizations in particular, and by conducting an interviewbased user study.

1. Introduction

2. Related work and motivation

Hierarchies are a quite common and widely
applicable information structure, and have thus been the
focus of extensive Computer Science-related research
[1]. Since hierarchies support a number of information
organization and retrieval approaches (i.e., file storage
and browsing, thematic categorizations in digital
libraries, ontology management and so on) research
efforts have produced a number of hierarchy
visualizations, aiming to help the users understand,
browse and manage the represented information.
Although many visualization techniques [2] have been
proposed insofar, the most widespread paradigms for file
browsing, which is an integral part of Personal
Information Management (PIM), are the indented list and

Browsing in hierarchies to locate specific items is a
common
task in environments encompassing
information-seeking. Especially in the case of PIM, there
is a well-documented tendency [4] [5] of users towards
browsing (as opposed to searching) in order to locate a
specific file in their collection. In particular, the work
presented in [5] notes that users overwhelmingly prefer
browsing and suggest that this probably happens because
it engages more actively the mind and body and imparts
a sense of control. However, it is unclear from existing
studies how current visualization methods and tools
relate to browsing and what is the extent of the indented
list paradigm use (e.g., WE) as compared to the extent of
other methods’ use.

In most hierarchical visualization evaluations [3] [6]
[7], indented list visualizations report a significantly
better performance for node finding tasks, and are
therefore established as baseline methods for the
evaluation of the rest of the visualizations.
The work presented in [8] evaluates several
hierarchy visualizations and reports that WE shows a
very good overall performance with regard to
correctness, speed of task completion, and user
satisfaction but notes that the potential practice effects
for the other systems should not be overestimated.
Moreover, it concludes that while at least one system
achieved the same performance as WE, none of them
showed benefits for users that went significantly beyond
this baseline. It is however not yet clear whether WE
success is owing to user familiarity with it or to possible
inherent advantages, compared to other visualizations. In
the work presented in [9] for example, Hierarchical
Browsing is reported to facilitate information seeking
tasks when the user is not looking for specific and
already known information.
The aforementioned studies focused on the use of
WE for retrieval tasks in an unknown hierarchy. [10], on
the other hand, reports on a comparative study between
WE and a simple ZUI-based file browser in the context
of both a familiar and an unfamiliar hierarchy. The initial
hypothesis of this experiment was that the Indented List
visualization would perform better than the simple ZUI
when the user browsed for items the location of which
was unknown, while the simple ZUI would perform
better for items the location of which was known.
Statistical tests on task completion times reported by [10]
did not support this hypothesis; however, user comments
did suggest a preference towards WE when browsing an
unknown hierarchy. Its worth noting, however, that the
user group used in [10] contained only one participant
that actually used WE systematically: this weakens the
argument that WE success may be owing to user
familiarity with it, but weakens also the statistical
credibility of the results, since a user group is clearly
underrepresented.
The current evaluation is an effort to further clarify
the issue by conducting a larger scale interview-based
user study on the topic and, at the same time, explore the
users’ browsing habits and how they relate to the
visualization paradigm used. The following section
describes the user study group and method.

this purpose, while other implementation use an indented
list under the folder icon (Gnome Nautilus List option).
The ZUI visualization is a method offered by most
OSes and window-based environments for file browsing.
The current hierarchy level is displayed, with each subfolder visible either in a list or in a tiled manner. If the
user wishes to inspect the contents (i.e., sub-folders and
files) of a particular folder s/he has to drill in it, by
double-clicking or single-clicking, depending on the
settings, so as to make it the current one. Depending on
the user preferences, a preview for documents may be
displayed (e.g., a thumbnail of pictures, movies or
graphics) while document previews may also be
embedded within the icon corresponding to the
containing folder.

3.2. User group
Our selected user group consisted of 76 users and
had the following characteristics:
• Gender : female (42), male (34)
• Age: 18–24 (18), 25–34 (41), 35–45 (15), >45 (2)
• Years of computer experience: 1-3y (1), >3y (75)
From the 76 users that form our group, 73 were
using a computer in their home, 64 in their working
environment and 49 for their studies (note that groups are
not mutually exclusive). 60 users out of the 76 declared
that they were self computer-literate, 20 users had
attended a seminar as well, and 30 stated that someone
(e.g., in a course or a friend) trained them (groups again
are not mutually exclusive).
For the needs of this study, we grouped the
participants according to their competence, when using
the computer, in three major categories:
Low Competence (L.C.) – 13 users: LC users have
the minimum skills required to use the computer for basic tasks such as compiling a Word document or surfing
the web. They lack knowledge of basic desktop tasks
such as creating or moving a folder, placing items on the
desktop and so on. The desktop area for them is at the
best case a point of access to “My Documents” and to
program shortcuts. These users do not generally have a
complicated folder hierarchy but rather have few
documents stored in the default OS location (e.g., My
Documents).
Basic Competence (B.C.) – 27 users: BC users
have basic familiarity with windows operations, enough
to allow them to organize their documents in folder
hierarchies. They are aware of the uses of the desktop as
a temporary or more permanent file repository and are
capable of organizing it, adding or removing items from
it. They are able to install programs and perform simple
maintenance tasks (e.g., using an antivirus).
High Competence (H.C.) – 36 users: HC users
have a deep understanding of computer operations,
including programming, hardware knowledge and
handling complex OS issues. These users exhibit
complicated hierarchies of files.
Participants used one or more OSes, as shown in
Table 1. All subjects used an OS of the Microsoft

3. User study description
3.1. Description of compared visualizations
The Indented List visualization represents the
folder hierarchy as a tree with the sub-folders presented
as a list under their parent and indented to its right. The
lists of sub-folders may be retracted or expanded at will
by clicking on their parent. The files and direct subfolders within the selected folder are displayed to the
right of this visualization; WE uses a separate pane for

107

Windows family, while some of them were using another
OS too.

Apart from WE, users stated that they use other file
browsers following the indented list paradigm. Some of
these browsers offer the indented list as an option (e.g.,
“Folders” options in the Windows XP OS). Table 3 lists
these browsers and the number of subjects that use them.

3.3. User tasks
As already stated, the core motivation of this study
was to investigate issues related to visualization used for
file browsing. Therefore, the task of locating a file or
folder in one’s hierarchy was thoroughly examined. The
tasks of moving and comparing files or folders were also
taken into consideration during the interview and
questions regarding these tasks were posed to the users.

3.4. Method
The interview was conducted at the users’ home or
working environment and lasted about 15 minutes. It was
based on a set of questions to guide the discussion, but
users were asked to elaborate more when they felt it was
necessary, or add any comment that was not covered by
the questions. When needed, they were shown in the
computer the particular features they were asked about,
in order to avoid cases of misconceptions on used
terminology. In certain cases, they were asked to
demonstrate their browsing method for accessing files
and folders. The last two points, together with the ability
to further elaborate on subject answers lacking detail,
were the main reasons why interviews were chosen over
questionnaires for data collection in this experiment.

Table 3: The use of WE and other browsers that
offer an indented list option.
The 1 BC user of Nautilus also uses WE in
Windows. Of the 13 HC users that use other browsers
apart from WE, 2 use only Nautilus and 1 only Total
Commander. As to how they learned of WE, table 4
summarizes the replies given.

Table 4: How users learned about of WE.
The most prominent answer is “Someone showed
me”, which is indicative of 2 things:
1. ILBs, and WE in particular, are not that obvious to
the user so as to discover them by him/herself. The
help of an experienced friend or colleague is needed
in most cases, to show them the existence and use
of the tool for the first time.
2. Very few users seemed to have learned about WE
in a formal seminar; out of the 20 that had attended
a seminar, only four stated that they were shown
how to use WE in it.
Several users stated that they do not use an ILB for
every browsing task, but rather in specific cases. Table 5
summarizes the reasons given for the use of an ILB.
Users of ILBs who fall into the “Other Cases”
category, do not use the browser regularly; they only use
it for a number of (often diverse) specific tasks, such as

4.1. Use of Indented list Folder Browsers
From the 76 interviewed users, 66 (86%) know that
an indented list browser (ILB) exists, while 40 users
(about 53%) use one. Results by competence are
presented in the following table:
Mann-Whitney tests on the pairs of ILB use according to competence showed a significant difference
between HC users and those of the other two groups,
revealing that there is a connection between user
competence and file browsing habits. This result is
partially expected, as HC users are more experienced
with the options offered by their OS and have more

108

moving files between folders, creating a new folder,
specifically for searches deep in the hierarchy, and so on.
Their preference in this case is based on the perceived
advantages of an ILB.

stated that they use an ILB (WE or an equivalent one), as
it reminds them of the DOS DIR command. Another
issue investigated was the connection between the users’
current OS(s) and ILBs. Table 9 presents these results.

As Table 6 shows, most users in favor of the
indented list paradigm commented that it is very useful
for quick access, as they can change the current folder
with one click and move between many levels at the
same time. It also provides an overview of the hierarchy,
especially useful for deep and/or wide hierarchies, or
when the user does not remember the exact path. On the
other hand, subjects that do not use an ILB gave various
reasons for this choice. These are summarized in Table 7.

4.2. Use of Views
Most Windows–based environments offer different
options as to how the user may view file and folder
icons. Since the majority of our user group was Windows
XP users, we apply here the classification of the icon
view options available in this OS. Although “Tiles” view
seems to be the default view after WinXP OS is installed,
only 7 users said that they use it. Table 10 presents user
preferences as to the View(s) that Windows XP employ.
As seen from the table, the most popular views were
Details, Thumbnails and List. About half the subjects
also stated that they alternate between their preferred
views according to the task at hand, as Table 11 shows.

Table 7: Reasons for not using an ILB
We made the hypothesis that using or not an ILB
depends not only on user competence, needs and tasks,
but also on the first OS s/he learned to operate. As seen
from Table 8, all users that started with Windows 3.1
seem to favor ILBs. Half of the first DOS and Windows
95 users seem to prefer of ILBs and the other half not,
while most users that started with other console-based
systems prefer ILBs. It is important to note that WE, in
particular, debuted in Windows 95 as a replacement for
the older Windows 3.1 File Manager [11]. User comments were enlightening on the use of ILBs. Many users,
especially HC, who started with Windows 3.1 or DOS,

Table 11: Frequency of view changes.
It is interesting that 21 of the 34 users that use the
“Thumbnails” view stated explicitly that they do so when
they are browsing for an image file. A usual comment for

109

the “List” view is that it was preferred when a folder
contained many items and the user wanted to locate an
item among them. “Details” view was preferred mostly
for tasks like finding the most recent version of a file in a
folder or grouping many files by type in order to make
easier locating a specific one.
As Table 12 shows, “name” is the most popular
sorting option, followed closely by “Date Modified” and
“Type”. “Date Modified” is used mostly when a user
works with different versions of documents, facilitating
the task of moving files between different locations (e.g.,
different computers or backup folders), and the task of
locating the most recent ones. “Type” is mostly used in
folders with many files, particularly system ones, without
icons. The Other column refers to “Arrange By User” (1
user) and “Date Created” (2 users).

The Address bar, located at the top side of the folder
window, is used to display the folder name or its full
path. The user may use this path by editing it to get
directly to a specific folder or use the Drop Down list
which provides direct access to the available top level
locations, like Desktop, My Computer and My
Documents. Users were prompted on the use of this
particular tool and specifically asked whether they use
the Address Bar to manipulate the file path directly
and/or whether they use the Drop Down list. Results are
presented in Tables 15 and 16.

Navigation Buttons (e.g., Back, Forward and Up) are
used for navigating with a zoomable folder browser, as
they offer the potential for reaching the upper or previous
folder level. Table 13 presents user answers regarding
the use of these buttons. As seen from the table, almost
all users at some point employ these buttons and the
majority of them use the buttons regularly. The “Up”
button seems to be the most popular one, with “Back”
following it closely. Forward seems to be a bit less used.
On “Back” specifically an HC user stated that he uses it
to go back to the previous level keeping selected the
folder he lastly entered, in order to be able to continue
browsing a long list from the last item checked.

Table 16: Users that use the Address Bar drop
down list to navigate
In both cases we may note that most of the users use
these features rarely or not at all. Those that do use the
path are in their majority HC users that take advantage of
the auto-complete properties of the path or delete many
folder levels at once in order to move instantly to another
location higher in the folder hierarchy.
The drop down list seems to be more under-used.
For some users it is the usual way for quick access to
other locations, but others do not use at all, preferring the
use of WE or the Task Pane in Windows XP.
The use of the keyboard in searching and browsing
for personal files does not seem to relate significantly
with the use of the Address Bar path and the drop down
list. An interesting point here is that these activities
concern mostly users of the HC group; in fact, using the
keyboard and the explorer path in a browsing task is
mostly an HC user's practice. On the other hand, people

Table 13: Use of Navigation Buttons

4.4. Use of the Keyboard
Most OSes provide keyboard shortcuts for many of
their operations. We investigated the use of the keyboard
as an alternative to the use of the mouse. The results are
presented in the following table. It seems that about half
of the participants use the keyboard regularly while
browsing their folders. The majority use it to locate
directly a specific file or folder by pressing the first letter
of its name. The rest use the arrows, the backspace or
other shortcuts like Alt+Tab. Some of the reasons they

110

using the Address Bar path in browsing tasks tend to use
an ILB (15 users), whereas the number of those who do
not use an ILB, while they use the path is lower (7).
Similarly, those who use the drop-down list and ILB
(12 users) are slightly more than those that use the list
but do not use an ILB. However, some users commented
that they don’t use the drop down list feature because
they use WE. One specific user that used the drop-down
list frequently to navigate stated that she started to use
WE when in some point the Address Bar had
disappeared from the folder window.

Documents and Open options offer by the OS or
applications. This hypothesis was not supported for HC
and LC users. LC users do not use WE in their majority
whereas the HC users have the ability and will to switch
more easily between tools according to the task at hand.
However, most of the BC users that used WE did not use
neither the Recent Document options nor the Open one.
These findings suggest that any file hierarchy
visualization should be complemented with additional
provisions to access files; these provisions may be timeoriented (recent documents), application-oriented (open
file) or both (applications’ recent documents).

4.6. Other ways of access to files
An issue investigated indirectly related to folder
browsing was the existing alternative ways to open a file
in windows-based OSes and Windows XP (the most
commonly used one) in our user group in particular. For
using the “My Recent Documents” list, users gave the
answers presented in Table 17. For using the “Recent
Documents” choice offered in several applications, the
answers are presented in Table 18. The most common
answer was “No”, meaning that most users did not prefer
to use this option. On the other hand, users that do use it
believe that it is convenient and one may save time with
it. The Recent Document feature existing in many
applications seems to be more popular, as a shown from
the Table 18. Subjects used this option when available
mostly when (a) the application was already open (b)
they did not remember the exact location of the file or (c)
they remembered it was recently used. In the case of
opening a file form the Open option of the application
(see Table 19) again most users stated that they prefer
this option for specific applications or when the
application is already open. Those that do not use it feel
that it is more convenient and quick to do it from the file
browser.

4.7. Search
The use of the search tool in any OS seems to be
very popular to the users. In our study (see Table 20),
~93% use Search tool when searching for their personal
files, independently of the competence group they belong
in, or whether they use WE or not. However, some of the
HC users who are very organized in their personal files
declared that they only use Search to locate system files.
An interesting remark here is that only the ~7% of the
participants states that they never use Search during their
searching activities, either because they manage to find
their files using an ILB or because they do not have a
large hierarchy, and thus they always find what they are
searching for.

Table 20: Results on the use of the Search tool.
The frequency with which users state that they use
this tool is assembled between “some times” (48,68%)
and “rarely” (30,26%), indicating that search is a
complementary tool to a user’s practices when seeking a
file. It is interesting to note that some users claimed that
the Search tool is extremely slow and that some of them
preferred to install and use the Google Desktop
application that seems to be very quick and efficient.

4.8. General Opinions and Suggestions
Two HC participants, who use WE for every task
they perform, claimed that they sometimes open two WE
windows side-by-side. Four HC and WE-users thought
that it would be useful to be able to see in the WE the

We made the hypothesis that ILBs may serve as a
complete tool for folder browsing, meaning that users
that employ them for their browsing tasks would not
need to use as much other tools like the Recent

111

contents of more than one folders. One of them also
stated that while using the WE, it happens to move by
chance a file to the wrong destination and suggested that
a message box could appear and inform the user before
moving the file. Moreover, a user suggested that WE
could support tabs, similarly to Konqueror in the Linux
K desktop environment (i.e., KDE), and another one
proposed a user-defined color and shape coding in the
folders of WE in order to be able to recognize
immediately the desired folders. Regarding the task of
moving/copying a group of files/folders, a user said that
he would like to have a file pool function similar to
multiple item clipboard in order to collect files from
different origins and then be able to move/copy all the
files at once to the desired destination. Furthermore, two
users claimed that they would like to have a way to
create hard links to files through the file browsing
visualizations in order to organize their files to multiple
categories without wasting disk space. Information
regarding the number of hard links of each file and a
more foolproof file removal interface would be useful.
Users that worked on other OSes, such as Mac OS X
and Linux, stated that WE seems to be slow, lacks in
efficiency and has limited possibilities. One Mac OS X
user said he likes that Finder has shortcuts to his desired
folders and that he can easily browse its contents. A user
also proposed WE having integration with the Web in
order to be able to mount network shares, a feature that
exists in Nautilus File Manager of Linux.

tools available for aiding them while searching and
browsing and they limit their practices in what they first
learned in order to open and edit their personal files.
However, even the LC users who know the existence
of WE choose not to use it, since they have learned to
reach their documents in other ways. These remarks
enhance our conclusion that LC users make very
restricted use of the tools offered by their operating
system, whereas the HC users seem to have explored the
same functionalities and they develop their usual
practices according to their personal preferences.
As all subjects use Windows as their main or
secondary operating system (73 of them use Windows
XP and the rest Windows Vista or 2000) there were
points to be made on the comparison of Windows with
other operating systems. Search and the use of
Thumbnails, for example, were characterized as
“problematic” and “too slow” by some users.

Conclusions and Future Work
The user study of 76 users of various competence
levels presented in this work, is an attempt to provide insight in the use of various visualizations and tools provided for folder browsing by current OSes.
A main and rather expected conclusion of this work
is that the HC users exhibit more variety in the use of the
available OS functionalities than BC and LC ones.
Almost all LC and most BC users preferred the simple ZUI method for accessing their files and folders. 78%
of the HC users, on the other hand, seem to employ an
ILB in all cases or in specific ones. The use of ILBs
seems to be related with deep and wide hierarchies for
which there is a need for quicker access and better
overview than the ZUI paradigm provides.
A main issue mentioned by many BC and HC users
is that WE is in fact hidden and difficult to be made as
default browser in recent versions of the Windows OS.
This had an impact on the use of WE, since it seems that
many of the users that started using a computer with an
MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 OS seem to prefer WE as a
folder browsing tool.
The majority of users belonging in the LC group
state that they do not use an indented list explorer. The
reason for this is that they may not know its existence in
combination with the fact that they maintain a shallow
hierarchy and thus they know the exact location of their
files. It seems that these users are not very keen in using
the OS functionalities, they do not explore the various
