Abstract

often have not enough information because data is too
summered up or they get lost in overly detailed data
reports. These reports are generally static, what brings
difficulties to the information relating process and time is
usually a critical factor for the success of the decision to
be taken.
Automating the generation of information and
manipulating it in an easy and intuitive way is what
every decision maker looks for. Over the last years, data
mining techniques, among others, have been used to
generate new business information, but manipulating and
understanding the results is not always a simple task. A
growing number of information visualization tools are
being created to fill the blanks left by these techniques
regarding data exploring and analysis, hoping to be able
to shout the famous "Eureka!".
The greatest contribution of an information
visualization tool is to make it possible for the decision
maker to identify the expected and discover the
unexpected [1], what brings process improvement and
business opportunities. For every company, knowing its
business transactions is the same as to understand the
behavior of their clients and the requirements to satisfy
them.
The purpose of this paper is to use a multiple
coordinated views tool [2] [3], named PRISMA, to
explore, visualize and analyze the behavior of business
transactions, identifying problems that might be
occurring during transactions, in order to improve or
discover business opportunities in them.
This paper is organized as follows: related work of
business transaction behavior analysis and information
visualization; description of the tool PRISMA;
description of the used dataset; discussion of the
obtained results from the analysis; final remarks and
future work.

Getting to know clients and their behavior is
essential in the growing process of any company that
searches for improvement and business opportunities.
One of the ways to discover more about their clients'
behavior is to analyze the history of their transactions
with the company or partners. The amount of
transactions is often huge, what demands tools that help
explore and analyze data in search for patterns or
outliers. The tool used in this paper is called PRISMA
and is based on multiple coordinated visualization
techniques. Its mqjor goal is to enhance the user's
perception about data and what is related to it
identifying problems that might occur during
transactions, in order to improve or find business
opportunities in them.

Coordinated Views, Business Transactions

l, Introd ucti on
The success of any business can be evaluated by
many criteria, the major of them being client satisfaction.
Sometimes client satisfaction can be translated into user
satisfaction over business profit. Client satisfaction is not
a simple fact, but a sequence of information and
decisions about the quality of services (predict
improvement of infrastructure based on client growth),
offered products (defining expansion, with variety or
specialty), getting to know the clients (establish client
profile, what services and products they acquire and the
frequency - regularly or rarely), among other things.
If criteria are known, why do so many companies
have trouble achieving their goals? The analysis of large
amounts of data is not a trivial task and system reports do
not always answer all of the questions. Decision makers

4, Dataset
The selected dataset contains information on
electronic transactions performed by clients of a financial
company during a 30-day period, The dataset includes
the date, time, product, status of the transaction
(successful, denied, canceled, retumed and on hold),
transaction amount, account amount credit amount
number in;;talment.

This section presents related work on business
transactions analysis and information visualization,
Ziegler & et al. propose a technique for visualizing
financial time series data based on a pixel-based
paradigm which consists of a two-dimensional
rectangular box model in a Cartesian coordinate system
with orthogonal axes [4],
Keim & et aI, presented a new technique named
value-cell bar charts for visualizing large transaction
datasets [5] for monitoring and analyzing business
operations, The user visualizes the data based on either
the number of transactions (as in pixel bar charts) or the
total value of the transactions (as in traditional bar
charts) to identify the transactions that are important to
their business,
This work focuses the use of multiple coordinated
views to support the analysis of business transactions and
the identification of patterns and opportunities related to
the analyzed transactions,

5, Analysis Results
A growing number of companies provide their
clients with a digital relationship channel through which
services or products may be offered,
The analysis of these electronic transactions helps to
understand the relationship between the clients and the
company, Client transaction may be split into the
following categories: successfully finished; denied due to
a business rule; on hold; canceled by system failure; and
retumed (automatically or manually),
A competitive advantage may be reached by the
appropriate analysis of the transactions that were refused
because of a business rule, The understanding of client
behavior helps to measure client satisfaction with a
product or the company itself.
A denied client transaction may represent a simple
and typical occurrence related to the main characteristic
of the company business, such as an invalid password or
insufficient amount available at the client account. On
the other hand, the same transaction category may
indicate an opportunity to improve the product of create
a new product that is more appropriate to an specific
group of clients, such as the identification of clients
trying to use a product but failing to do so because of
inappropriate profiles,
For example, if the average number of denied
transactions is between 15% and 25% and it raises
considerably in an specific month of the year, this may
indicate that the clients do not have the proper
information about the product or that the electronic
interface is difficult to use or that a similar product
should be provided for the group of interested clients,
The goal of this study is to analyze problems that
may be occurring with electronic transactions and
improve them or in some cases, determine the need to
create new ones,
The analysis of the status of transactions (0 success, E - denied, C - canceled, 0 - retumed and P on hold) was based on the color associated to each status
on the three views of the tool. The treemap view was
organized by transaction status and error code, In the
scatterplot view the axis was either the amount on the
account, the requested amount of the transaction or the
available credit amount. The parallel coordinates view
included the transaction amount and the number of
instalments, The pie chart and the treemap view point out
that 70% of transactions were successful, 23% were
denied, 2% were canceled by system failure or timeout

3, PRISMA
PRISMA is an information visualization tool based
VIews
to
explore
on
multiple
coordinated
multidimensional datasets using the visualization
techniques of treemap, scatterplot and parallel
coordinates [6].
The main characteristics of the PRISMA are:
• Extensible, portable and easy to maintain
since it has been developed in Java using
design patterns,
•
The graphic interface is automatically
customized to data types and the range of
data values in each dataset.
•
The filter components are optimized for the
user tasks using the same principle,
•
Coordination is supported in filter, color,
shape and size settings, as well as in the
details-on-demand component.
• Many data sources are supported, such as
relational databases, XML files and preformatted text files,
• Pie, bar and line
graphics
and
automatically-generated
reports
are
additional coordinated components,
The tool implements three information visualization
techniques, each favoring a different kind of data
analysis: parallel coordinates, Treemap and scatterplot
[7] [8] PRISMA allows the user to analyze data either
individual or simultaneously in all views,
PRISMA stores an user interaction history including
manipulation and configuration data and allows the user
to save the state of an explored visualization,

Fig. l. Brushing technique in PRISMA
Mter the identification of the expected distribution of
transaction status, other scenarios were explored. First, a
filter selection was applied to present only denied and
canceled transactions. On the treemap view the main
error code was related to insufficient amount on the
client's account. This perception is confirmed in the
scatterplot view as highlighted in red (Fig. 2). An
unexpected pattern, however, indicated a number of

denied transactions for clients with sufficient amount on
their accounts (highlighted in blue). The selection of
these occurrences brought the attention to error message
M5 - clients were trying to perform transactions for
products unavailable for their client categories. This was
interpreted as a business opportunity directed to the
identified group of clients.

In a different scenario the canceled transactions were
added to the visualization (Fig. 3). It was then possible to
notice that these transactions although in small number
are significant when the total amount is considered. For
example, for a total movement of $30.000.000 in a
month, $1.000.000 was lost in canceled transactions.
This numbers raise concerns about the image of the
company that may be harmed by system failures or low

performance. Additionally, the total amount available for
transactions for these clients represent 12,06% of
canceled transactions (Fig.3) and 2,48% of denied
transactions(FigA). The total amount available for these
clients reaches l4,54%.
For a total volume of
transactions of $30.000.000 the potential volume of lost
business transactions was of approximately $4.300.000.

Fig, 5, Identification of a potential product for new business opportunities
information and discover new information as a powerful
tool for business planning.
The analysis focused on transactions either denied
because of a business rule or canceled due to system
failure or low performance. Although the transactions
were correctly refused, the behavior of the clients and
their transactions shown the available products were
inappropriate to a typical client profile. The company has
lost many business opportunities because of the lack of
more appropriate products for its clients.
The teclmique also identified that even a small
number of canceled transactions (345 items) may
potentially compromise 14,5% of the total amount of
transactions.
We highlight the following future developments:
•
Application of the tool to different types of
customer-relationship electronic transactions;
•
Extensive tests for usability purposes;
•
Development of new visualization teclmiques
for business analysis;

Conclusions
Large companies offer a growing number of
products and services to their clients through electronic
channels. Information related to the complete and
incomplete transactions processed by this channel is an
important resource to better understand the behavior of
the clients and the relationship between clients and
offered products. Information visualization tools support
the analysis of these large datasets. In particular, this
paper focused on the use of multiple coordinated views
for this task.
The use of an Information Visualization tool with
the characteristics ofPRISMA has proven in this study to
potentially facilitate the analysis of business transactions,
support the decision-making process and therefore
improve the efficiency of products and services. This
paper has presented how the parallel coordinates
technique may be used to identifY the expected
