Abstract

possible to address issues based on algorithmics and combinatorial analysis. Over the years, node and edge metrics
have been defined by analysts coming from different discipline to identify salient properties in graphs. As a consequence, the literature offers metrics aiming at similar goals.
Different names and analytics description often hide similarity between two metrics that originated from different
fields.
This paper surveys a set of edge metrics, comparing
their behavior on various graphs. We end up showing that
the Jaccard metric designed back in 1901 [16] appears as
a common ancestor and unique representative for a set of
edge metrics. Our study should ultimately lead to a useful
taxonomy of all available edge and node metrics, contributing to the field of visual graph analytics, just as Botafogo,
Rivlin and Shneiderman had contributed with a survey on
metrics for hierarchies and potential applications for the
analysis of hypertexts [5], for instance.

Visual graph analytics definitely relies on the use of node
and edge metrics to identify salient properties in graphs.
Most often, these metrics are turned into useful visual cues,
or are used to interactively filter out parts of a graph while
querying it, for instance. Along the years, analysts coming
from different application domains have designed metrics to
serve specific needs.
Graph analytics, sometimes also called network science,
recently developed as a cross-discipline field developing
models shared by numerous application domains such as
bio-informatics, social network analysis, web graphs, etc.
[4] [10]. As a consequence, we end up finding various
metrics in the literature aiming at similar goals; different
names and analytics description often hide similarity between two metrics that originated from different fields.
We survey a list of edge metrics for graphs and compare
their relative value and behaviour, in an effort to organize
them into a taxonomy and underline the genuine ingredients
in each of them disregarding their origin.

2. Edge metrics for visual graph analytics
Social network analysts have been actively designing
and using metrics on graphs for decades [11] [22], mainly
driven by the notion of network centrality [7]. More recently, edge and node metrics appeared within the field of
bio-informatics where graphs typically model interactions
between biological entities [4].
The edge betweenness, extending betweenness centrality for nodes, relies on the computation of shortest paths in
a network. Let G = (V, E) denote a (undirected) graph as
usual, and let e = {u, v} denote an edge. The edge betweenness is defined as:

1. Introduction
Graphs appear as essential modeling and analytical objects, and as effective visual analytics paradigms. They are
a flexible and powerful mathematical tool to model real-life
situations. For example, they naturally map to transportation networks, electric power grids, and they are also used
as artifacts to study complex data such as observed interactions between people, or induced interactions between various biological entities. Graphs are successful at turning
semantic proximity into topological connectivity, making it

tween two nodes s and t ∈ V going through the edge
e = {u, v}. This metric suffers from a high computational
costs, as it requires O(n + m) space and run in O(nm) and
O(nm + n2 log n) time on unweighted and weighted networks, respectively, where n and m are the number of nodes
and edges in the network [6]. This metric typically is global
because the computation of the value for a single element
nevertheless requires to traverse the whole graph.

2.1. Variations on the Jaccard metric
Other metrics are local, in the sense that the value for
a node or an edge only requires to visit neighbors at a
bounded distance. In 1901, Jaccard introduced the following metric in the context of classification (in botany):

it to assess the probability that two nodes should be connected or not. In their work, they also use the Meet/Min
metric defined as:
CM eet/M in (u, v) =

|N (v) ∩ N (u)|
.
min(|N (u)|, |N (v)|)

The main difference with Jaccard stands from the fact
that the ratio is computed not with the size of the whole
set of neighbors N (u) ∪ N (v) but only with the minimum
degree between d(u) and d(v). Observe that, given the degrees of u and v, this number indeed computes the maximum size of the set N (u) ∩ N (v). The two metrics definitely compute different values, as shown in Figure 2. The
Jaccard metric does take the two neighbors stemming at the
right of v while the Meet/Min metric remains equal.

|N (v) ∩ N (u)|
|N (v) ∪ N (u)|
where u, v ∈ V and N (u), N (v) denote the neighborhoods of u and v. That is, N (u) gathers all nodes sitting at
distance one from u (one hop). More precisely, the Jaccard
metric looks at the size of the set W (u, v) = N (u) ∩ N (v)
of common neighbors to u and v, and compares it with the
size of all neighbors to either u or v.
CJaccard (u, v) =

Figure 2. (a) Both Jaccard and Meet/Min assign a value of 1 to the edge e. (b) The Jaccard metric assigns 1/2 while the Meet/Min
metric still returns a value of 1.

Figure 1. Neighbors of vertices u and v incident to an edge e are partitioned into three
distinct subsets.
Yet another description of the Jaccard metric is to say
that it counts the number of triads or triangles (cycles of
length 3) containing the edge e (Figure 1 (a)). Incidentally,
the notion of a triad in a social network has been extensively discussed and used to characterize the roles of actors
and to identify communities in networks [13]. Thus Jaccard
clearly appears as being common to both (classification in)
biology and social network analysis. Note however that the
Jaccard metric does not solely apply to networks, but can be
extended to subsets of attributes associated with elements u
and v.
Golberg and Roth [12] observed that the Jaccard metric
actually applies to any pair of nodes in a network, and used

At this point, we wish to compare these two metrics
when computed on a whole graph. Indeed, from a visualization point of view the slight variations in value of either
of these two metrics might not be significant since they are
converted into a colormap, for instance. Also, when used as
a threshold to filter out edges, the difference may be close
to unnoticeable since the value clearly distribute in a similar
way. The example graphs we used are random small world
graphs computed from the Graph Visualization Framework
Tulip [1] “Grid approximation” plug-in 1 . These graphs are
generated by choosing a number of points on the 2D plane
uniformly at random. Nodes are then connected based on
their proximity.
Figure 3 (a) shows a scatterplot where nodes are mapped
to their (Meet/Min, Jaccard) coordinates. As can readily
be seen, the values group along the main diagonal showing a clear correlation between the two metrics, thus confirming that they both find the same salient properties in
a network. As expected the colormap induced from these
two metrics do not differ significantly, at least from visual
inspection. Note also that salient (darker) neighborhoods
identified from the Jaccard metric do coincide with those

stemming from the use of the Meet/Min metric, which is
both predicted and confirmed from the scatterplot.
Note this time the use of the product at the denominator. Now, the size of neighborhoods can be computed using
rows of the adjacency matrix au , av which can be seen as bit
vectors indicating the set of neighbors of u and v. We have
|N (u)| = au , au and |N (u) ∩ N (v)| = au , av , where
au , au = ||u||2 equals the square of the length of the vector au . As a consequence the Geometric metric computes
the square of the cosine similarity index:

CGeometric (u, v) =
Figure 4. The small world graph (grid approximation) is color-mapped using the Jaccard
metric.

where ·, · is the usual scalar product between vectors,
and θ equals the angle formed by the two vectors au and
av . As a matter of fact, the cosine similarity has been used
for decades in text mining for analyzing co-occurrence measures (see [20] for instance). Hence, we see a convergence
from three different domains towards the same type of ideas
and metrics, namely text analysis and information retrieval,
social network analysis and bio-informatics.

Ravazs et al. [19] introduced a variation on the Meet/Min
metric, they call the topological overlap matrix (TOM), taking into account the fact that an edge may or may not exist
between u and v. They define:

CT OM (u, v) =

Figure 3 (b) shows the scatterplot combining Jaccard
with Geometric (cosine similarity). The correlation between these two is even stronger than what is observed
from coupling Jaccard with Meet/Min. This does not totally come as a surprise, as revealed by the denominator of
the Jaccard metric expressed using scalar product. Indeed,
we have |N (u)∪N (v)| = ||au ||2 +||av ||2 − au , av . Again,
the visual inspection of the colormap induced from the Geometric metric in Figure 6 confirms the correlation between
these three metrics when used to visually identify salient
properties in graphs. The main difference is the ability of
any of these metrics to better identify differences between
lower or higher values.

|N (v) ∩ N (u)| + auv
min(|N (u)|, |N (v)|) + 1 − auv

where auv denotes the u, v entry of the adjacency matrix
of the graph. As for Goldberg et al., they use their metric
to identify clusters interpreted as functional modules in the
cell. As can be expected, the similarity with Meet/Min is
even more striking.
Goldberg et al. [12] also introduce what they call the Geometric metric between two nodes, defined as:
CGeometric (u, v) =

au , av 2
= cos(θ)2
||u||2 · ||u||2

|N (v) ∩ N (u)|2
.
|N (u)|.|N (v)|

(m)

where zu v is the number of cycles of length m going
(m)
through an edge {u, v} and where they define su v as the
maximum number of cycles there could be, given the degree
of the two vertices u and v, hence mimicking the denominator of the Geometric metric extended to larger neighbor(2)
hoods since they put su v = min(|N (u)|, |N (v)|). The authors unfortunately do not provide an analytic form for sm
uv
and m > 2.
Yip and Horvath [26] introduced a generalization of
Ravasz’ TOM metric extending it to neighbors at a bounded
distance from two nodes u and v. More precisely, define
Nm (u) as the set of nodes sitting at most m hops from
u. That is the minimum length of a path connecting these
nodes with u is m. Then, GTOM is defined as:

Figure 6. The same graph as in Figure 4 is
color-mapped using the Geometric (cosine
similarity) metric.

CGT OMm (u, v) =

2.2. Extending Jaccard to larger neighborhoods

Note that GTOM coincides with TOM when m = 1. As
we did with TOM, we drop the au v from the definition and
consider the generalized Meet/Min metric instead:

Notwithstanding its essential role in social network analysis, the strict notion of a triad in a network sometimes may
not be strong enough as a salient property of the graph to
algorithmically identify communities. As a consequence,
a number of authors have defined metrics trying to capture
patterns formed by larger neighborhoods.
Auber et al. [2] defined what they called edge strength in
an effort to identify edges acting as bridges between communities. Their metric combines two terms γ3 and γ4 , the
first term being the Jaccard metric of an edge e. The second term γ4 computes the relative number of cycles of size
4 containing the edge (see Figure 1 (b)). This can be computed using the ratio:

CGM eet/M inm (u, v) =

|Nm (u) ∩ Nm (v)|
.
min(|Nm (u)|, |Nm (v)|)

Similarly, one can define the generalized Jaccard metric
by setting:
CGJIm (u, v) =

|Nm (v) ∩ Nm (u)|
.
|Nm (v) ∪ Nm (u)|

The scatterplots from Figure 7 show how these generalized Meet/Min and Jaccard metrics correlate on our small
world example graphs. Again the values group along the
diagonal indicating that these generalized metrics indeed
identify the same salient properties. However, as we let m
increase, the differences between the two metrics become
more and more apparent, as could have already been predicted from the observation made earlier from Figure 2.

e(Mu , Mv ) + e(Mu , Wu v ) + e(Mv , Wu v ) + e(Wu v )
|Mu ||Mv | + |Mu ||Wu v | + |Mv ||Wu v | + W2u v
where e(A, B) (or e(A)) denotes the number of edges
between the two sets A and B (or within a set A). The denominator simply computes the maximum number of such
cycles there could be, where all terms list all possible cases
of forming a cycle of length 4 – see Figure 1 (b). The
strength of an edge is then simply defined as Cstrength (e) =
CJaccard (e) + γ4 (e). To our knowledge, the edge strength
metric is efficient at identifying communities in networks
where clusters are more densely connected (see [2] and [9]
for more details).
Raddichi et al. [18] have designed a similar generalization, computing the ratio:

3. Global vs local metrics
Although the edge betweenness metric we mentioned at
the beginning of this section suffers from being computationally expensive, we still need to assess of its differences
with the Jaccard-type metrics we’ve been studying in more
details. Figure 8 shows the scatterplot combining edge betweenness with Jaccard.
The scatterplot clearly confirms that there is no correlation whatsoever between the two metrics. However, the
scatterplot can be divided into several regions in order to
identify various roles nodes can hold in the network. Edges
with high Jaccard / low centrality index typically link nodes

Pursuing the same goal as Jaccard for unweighted
graphs, Burt [8] has used edge constraint to identify what
he calls “structural holes” in social network as well as various roles of individuals in their social network, showing
a clear correlation between node constraint and individual
performance.
The strict generalization of Jaccard to weighted graphs
using scalar product of weight vectors is due to Tanimoto
[24] (see also [21]).

5. Conclusions and future work
Figure 7. (a) GMeet/Min2 (horizontal) vs GJI2
(vertical). (b) GMeet/Min3 (horizontal) vs GJI3
(vertical)

We have provided a survey of edge metrics for undirected, simple (no loops) and unweighted graphs, with a
clear focus on local metrics. Our methodology is based on
both the visual inspection of graphs with edges colored according to metric values, and numerical comparison with
scatterplots. Clearly, the Jaccard metric can be seen as the
archetype metric for finding core communities in networks
based on the notion of a triad. Extension of these metrics
to larger neighborhoods have also been studied and compared, from which the generalized Jaccard metric and edge
strength seems to be genuine.
We plan to further extend our survey and comparative
study to node metrics, including global metrics such as betweenness centrality (for nodes), node excentricity or node
efficiency [7] [15], and local metrics such as the clustering
index [25], or Strahler numbers [3], or Shannon’s entropy
[23], etc.
In some cases, these metrics can be extended and used
to evaluate the relative role of nodes in clustered graphs, as
with Guimera’s participation coefficient [14] which appears
as a variation of Shannon’s entropy.

4. Dealing with weighted graphs
Our study should also extend to metrics for weighted
graphs, although a thorough study obviously is out of the
scope of this paper.
In their work on community identification, Newman and
Girvan [17] gave a generalization of edge betweenness for
weighted graphs, thus providing a first example of a global
metric for edges. A metric acting similarly to Jaccard for
weighted graphs is Burt’s edge constraint, defined as:
