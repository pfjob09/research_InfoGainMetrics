the optimal alternatives (ideal solutions) that best meet
consumers’ preferences for the new product design.

Abstract— In the traditional product design field, most studies
focus on commercial products (e.g. furniture, vehicle,
consumer electronics, and so on), while few studies pay
attention on the craft art. As such, this paper conducts a
consumer-oriented experiment on characteristic toys to
determine how to best meet consumers’ preferences for new
product design. The characteristic toy is a good illustration to
be an application of art and design, because it is not only one
type of craft art, but also a commercial product. The
characteristic toy has two features simultaneously of craft art
and product design. In this study, the new approach proposed
consists of two main methods, i.e. the quantification theory
type I (QTTI) and the technique for order preference by
similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). There are three QTTI
models used to build a design decision support database.
According to the design decision support database, a QTTIbased TOPSIS model is used to help product designers to
obtain the optimal design alternatives that best meet
consumers’ preferences.

We present the primary procedure of a consumeroriented approach in the context of characteristic toys in this
section.
In the experimental study, we first collect about 179
characteristic toys and then classify them based on their
similarity degree by a focus group which is formed by 6
product experts/designers with at least two years’ experience
of product design. In order to avoid or reduce the cognitive
demand from the experimental subjects and to maintain the
judgment consistency, it is necessary to reduce the
experimental samples. To this end, the focus group
eliminates some highly similar samples through discussions.
Then the hierarchy cluster analysis is used to extract the
representative samples of characteristic toys. The 35
representative characteristic toy samples are selected by the
cluster tree diagram [6, 7].
The morphological analysis is used to extract the product
form elements of the 35 representative characteristic toy
samples. The focus group is asked to decompose the
representative samples into several dominant form elements
and form types according to their knowledge and experience.
Based on the result of the morphological analysis, there are 7
product form elements and 24 associated product form types
being identified. The 7 product form elements are Length
Ratio of Head and Body (X1), Width Ratio of Head and Body
(X2), Costume Style (X3), Costume Pattern (X4), Headdress
(X5), Appearance of Facial Features (X6), and Overall
Appearance (X7).
An emotional assessment experiment is usually
performed to elicit consumers’ psychological feelings or
preferences about a product using the semantic differential
method. Image words are often used to describe consumers’
preferences of the product in terms of ergonomic and
psychological estimation [8]. In this study, we collect about
110 image words which are used to describe the
characteristic toys. Then we apply factor analysis and cluster
analysis according to the result of the semantic differential
method. Finally, 3 representative image words, i.e. “cute
(CU)”, “artistic (AR)”, and “attractive (AT)”, are determined
[4, 6, 7]. To obtain the assessed values for the emotional

INTRODUCTION

Product designers need to comprehend consumers’
feelings or preferences in order to design successful products
in an intensely competitive market [5]. However, the
consumers’ preferences are quite difficult to describe clearly
by quantitative models or mathematical formulas, because it
is regarded as something of a black box [3]. In order to
clarify the decision-making process of the consumers’
preferences, we conduct an experimental study on
characteristic toys (dolls, mascots, cuddly toys, or called
“gongzi” in Mandarin), due to the great popularity in eastern
Asia (particularly in Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong) [6].
The characteristic toy is not only a craft work but also a
commercial product [6]. As such, it is well suitable to be an
illustration to show how to best meet the consumers’
preferences for a new product design.
In subsequent sections, we first present an application of
art and design, i.e. characteristic toys, to show how a
consumer-oriented approach can be used to extract
representative samples and form elements as numerical data
sets required for analysis. Then a QTTI-based TOPSIS
decision support model is built to help product designers get

preferences of 35 representative characteristic toy samples, a
100-point scale (1-100) of the semantic differential method is
used. 150 subjects (70 males and 80 females with ages
ranging from 15 to 50) are asked to assess the form (look) of
characteristic toy samples on an image word scale of 1 to
100, for example, where 100 is most attractive on the AT
scale. The emotional assessment experiment provides a
numerical data source for building a QTTI model, which can
be used to develop a design decision support model for the
new product design and development.

requirement or concept is proposed by consumers or product
designers [1]. For example, if the consumers prefer a new
characteristic toy with “slightly cute”, “moderately artistic”,
and “extremely attractive”, the TOPSIS design decision
support method can be described in the following main steps
[2, 4, 9]:

comparable scale for all criteria by

Step 1: Obtain the decision matrix C, i.e. the CU, AR, and
AT values of 4,860 design alternatives generated by the 3
QTTI models.

We use the QTTI analysis to examine the relationship
between the 7 product form elements and 3 image words [6].
In this paper, 7 independent variables (i.e. the 7 product form
elements) and 3 dependent variables (i.e. the cute, artistic,
and attractive image words) are used. As the result of the
QTTI analysis, Models (1), (2), and (3) indicate the
relationship between 7 product form elements and the given
image word. We can use these 3 models to input the values
of 7 product form variables, and then output the prediction
values of 3 image words. These 3 models can help the
product designers best meet consumers’ preferences for the
new product design [6].

where wj is the normalized weight of the jth attribute. As an
illustration, we can assign the value of 1, 3, and 5 for the
“slightly”, “moderately”, and “extremely”, respectively.
Hence, the normalized weights of the “slightly cute”,
“moderately artistic”, and “extremely attractive” are
1/(1+3+5), 3/(1+3+5), and 5/(1+3+5), respectively.

Step 4: Determine the positive and negative ideal alternatives.
The positive ideal alternative is a hypothetical alternative in
which all attribute values correspond to the best level. On the
contrary, the negative ideal solution is also a hypothetical
alternative in which all attribute values correspond to the
worst level. Denote the positive ideal alternative, A+, and the
negative ideal alternative, A-, as

In this illustration, we obtain A+ = (0.331489, 0.742651,
1.389189), and A- = (0.009454, 0.060928, 0.182248).
Step 5: Calculate the separation measures. The separation
(distance) between alternatives can be measured by the ndimensional Euclidean distance. The positive ideal
alternative, Si+, is given as

These 3 models enable us to build a design decision
support database that can be used to help determine the
optimal product form for best matching specific consumers’
preferences. The design decision support database can be
generated by inputting each of all possible combinations of
form types on each form element to these 3 models
individually for generating the associated preferences’ values.
The resultant design decision support database for
characteristic toy consists of 4,860 (=3×3×3×4×5×3×3)
different combinations of product form elements, together
with their associated CU, AR, and AT preference values. In
other words, there are 4,860 design alternatives generated by
these 3 models [6].
The TOPSIS method is used to determine the optimal
alternatives (ideal solutions), if the specific design

alternatives (ideal solutions) that best meet consumers’
preferences, we have conducted an experimental study on
characteristic toys. In this paper, three QTTI models (i.e. CU,
AR, and AT) have been used as a basis to build a design
decision support database. The QTTI-based TOPSIS
decision support model, in conjunction with a CAD system,
has been used to facilitate the design process for the new
characteristic toy design. The new approach proposed in this
study provides an effective mechanism for illustrating an
application of art and design.

Step 7: Rank 4,860 design alternatives by their Pi value to
best match the desirable consumers’ preferences. As an

alternatives with “slightly cute”, “moderately artistic”, and
