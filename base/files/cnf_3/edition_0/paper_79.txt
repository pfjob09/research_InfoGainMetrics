Abstract
This paper addresses opportunities for adaptation of
the microclimate surrounding housing in response to
climate change. It is based on study of an existing town and
two local social housing organisations in South Wales, UK.
It argues the design of external spaces around dwellings
will become more important as changes in lifestyle and
levels of outdoor activity are likely to increase, in natural
response to changed climatic conditions. It suggests that: in
South Wales housing is still being built that, in its fabric,
risks overheating within perhaps two decades ( some
overheating is already experienced); hence that external
contextual environment adaptation measures may become
increasingly critical; and that current regulations and
codes focus overmuch on the building, so the external
contextual environment is not addressed with the
importance it deserves. This is compounded because
mastery of integrated micro-climate simulation with
building and urban modelling tools is a challenge for the
average architectural designer. More data, more research,
better tools and file data exchange are held necessary.

achieve higher than code 3 of the code for sustainable
homes (CfSH) by mitigation techniques such as adding
renewable technologies to conventional often lightweight
timber frame or panel construction. This is observed to be
still common practice. It is suggested that perhaps as early
as in the 2030’s the climate change tipping point will be
reached in the UK, where the focus will need to be more on
summer cooling in dwellings, rather than winter heating.
(“The UKCP Threshold detector indicates that there is a
possibility in the 2030s of such periods of hot, dry weather
increasing by up to 5 fold,”[3]) This would suggest that
change to an adaptive approach is overdue. Thermal mass
can be claimed to be currently the most effective fabric first
methodology, rather than lightweight insulated timber
construction. With the relatively recent change from
traditional mass construction to lightweight some are
already experiencing overheating [4], and it may be held
that this can only become greater with climate change.
There are few provisions in the current English and Welsh
Building Regulations or the CfSH that address the local
environment, except for drainage, waste, emission of
airborne pollutants, and provision of private outdoor space.
Hence it is suggested that the house is often now treated as
if isolated from its context for building regulation energy
(and carbon) reduction and CfSH compliance. This is
compounded by those building performance simulation
tools (that are generally available for architectural design
practice) being similarly focused on the building itself,
rather than on the building in a dynamic relationship with
its local environment. These tools also demand expertise
that is not commonplace among architectural designers. As
a result it is easier for many to use the available simplified
regulation compliance checking tools. For many years
passive solar design principles often informed architectural
design practice. These principles included prioritisation of
that relationship between site context and building. Such
passive solar design is often now termed bio-climatic. It is
suggested that following the easiest path to regulatory
compliance has led to the neglect of this previous good
practice. These principles may well be of increasing
importance at the early design stage, due to impending

1. Introduction
This paper addresses two perceived polarisations in
design practice for houses to achieve low or zero carbon
and energy, in Wales, UK. The first is whether to prioritise
mitigation of climate change, or adaptation to it. The
second is whether to design houses that are in effect decoupled from their local environment, or that are bioclimatic, in harmony with that environment. Assistance and
support by the social housing organisations United Welsh
and Bron Afon is acknowledged. It is suggested that the
construction industry has been engaged for sometime in
mitigation measures, designed to make buildings more
energy efficient, with the aim of reducing green house gas
emissions, and limiting their effect on our future climate.
However the industry has been slower to recognise that
some changes to our climate are now inevitable. Welsh and
UK Government initiatives identify a fabric first approach
to construction [1][2]. However it is currently possible to

climate change. This paper discusses modification of the
local environment as part of an adaptive approach to
climate change in UK housing in general and Welsh
housing in particular. It identifies some of the emerging
tools and approaches to building performance simulation
that may be used to integrate design for adaptation of both
house and local environment. It is focused on adaptation of
that contextual environment. Measures such as water
management and conservation, planting and grass, are
considered critically important. However this paper is
focused on trees in particular, because: they assist in carbon
sequestration and thus mitigation as well as adaptation; and
may provide carbon neutral building materials and fuels.

modification of indoor environmental conditions will shift,
as the need for cooling overtakes the need for heating. A
requirement for cooler housing during the summer months
is likely to risk an increase in the demand for energy and
carbon intensive mechanical ventilation and comfort
cooling. The balance of energy used in modifying
environmental conditions is therefore likely to change from
one predominantly concerned with winter heating to a
situation in which more energy is used to provide
summertime cooling [9]. There is in Wales a prospect by
the 2080’s of future weather conditions not dissimilar to
those of the current Mediterranean, during the summer
months. In their publication, ‘Decent homes Need Decent
Spaces’, The National Housing Federation (NHF), in
conjunction with the Council for Architecture and the Built
Environment (CABE) [10] already recognise the benefits of
providing well designed external space adjacent to
individual dwellings and ‘community’ spaces between
dwellings. In addition to the increased amenity value for
occupants, the psychological benefits of green space are
recognised in a more recent publication by NHF, ‘Greener
neighbourhoods’ [11], which highlights the value of shared
community space in terms of increased social cohesion and
perceived levels of well-being. In fact some voluntary
organisations have achieved significant community
engagement in caring for, and acting as wardens for trees
and their local environment [12]. Thus it may be argued
that the design of the external spaces around dwellings will
become more important as levels of outdoor activity are
likely to increase, in a natural response to changed climatic
conditions. It may be predicted that there will be changes in
lifestyle as higher summer temperatures encourage more
fluid movement from indoor via semi-outdoor to fully
outdoor spaces. If we continue to build housing that, in its
fabric, risks overheating, as appears to be the current norm,
then external contextual environment adaptation measures
may become increasingly critical.

2. An inevitable need for adaptation
If global emissions were capped immediately, the
inertia in the climate system means the effect of past
emissions will continue to be felt for decades. These
changes will have a significant impact on how buildings
perform, and will necessitate a change in the way we
design, and construct them. This process of ‘adaptation’ to
changed environmental conditions is central to the theme of
this study. The UK Climate Change Projections [5] suggest
that average temperatures in the UK and Europe are likely
to increase more than the global average temperature
increase during the 21st Century. In general, the UK is
expected to experience hotter drier summers, and warmer,
wetter winters, with an increase in the frequency and
severity of extreme weather events, such as heat–waves,
flash-flooding and drought. The number of frost days is
likely to decrease with an overall reduced requirement for
winter heating. In Wales for example, the Met Office
central estimate for mean summer temperatures indicate an
increase of 4°C to 5°C by 2080 [6]. It is also essential to
consider the effect of extreme weather events, and the
potential for excessive peak summer temperatures, against
this background of change to average annual conditions.
There is now a growing consensus that the climate is
changing faster than at any time in the past millennium, and
that this will have major effects on many aspects of the
built environment. The current predictions for climate
change are described in the UKCIP09 scenarios prepared
by the UK Climate Impacts Programme [5].The ways in
which these changes will impact on buildings are not fully
understood although a publication in 2000 by the
Foundation for the Built Environment (now the BRE Trust)
[7] lists the impacts of climatic factors and their influence
on the fabric of buildings. In order to create sustainably
lasting structures, it is held likely that designs may need to
anticipate a diverse range of possible scenarios [8]. In his
seminal document, “Design for future climate:
Opportunities for adaptation in the built environment” [9],
Bill Gethin identified the need for an adaptive approach to
building for a changing climate. A requirement to design
housing which keeps us warm, must be balanced with the
need to keep housing cool as temperatures rise. It is
anticipated that the balance of energy use in relation to the

3. A building as object focus in current CfSH
The CfSH is embedded at present in Welsh Planning
regulation for housing development. It substantially limits
itself to building level measures, with limited exceptions:
e.g. a minimum requirement that peak run-off rates into
water courses for the newly developed site do not exceed
the value prior to development; insulation / heating
appliances gain credits where air contaminants and ozone
depleting substances are avoided while maintaining a low
global warming potential (GWP). But the significance of air
contaminants, such as diesel particulates and other transport
related pollution, is neither considered in the construction
process, nor in the proximity of residential development to
sources of pollution. Credits are awarded where good day
lighting levels [13], and “view of the sky” are evidenced in
the main living spaces. Yet sunlight penetration, considered
of psychological benefit [14], is not in the criteria. Credits
are gained for provision of private outdoor space,
identifying the benefit of outdoor activity, but criteria do

approach may be held to diminish thee potential for
contextual ecological impact on new developpment. [15]

4. Micro-climate adaptation
‘Energy Saving Through Landscaape Planning’,
published by the Property Services Agenccy (PSA) [16],
details research work carried out in the UK in response to a
mid 1970’s. The
crisis in oil supply and energy during the m
principles of utilising landscape for modiification of the
local micro-climate were clearly establishedd, but appear to
have fallen out of general use. Landscapee features may:
shade external areas from excessive solar raadiation; reduce
surface temperatures; provide coolingg by evapotranspiration; and provide cooled air forr ventilation in
warmer climates, where a bioclimatic respoonse to building
and environmental design is more commonlly adopted [17].
This paper questions whether these principles present a
viable strategy for an adaptive response tto the need for
summer time cooling, winter shelter, andd surface water
management, as the effects of climatte change are
experienced in Wales. These are principples that apply
particularly to a designed harmonious interrrelationship of
buildings and their landscape context, termedd bioclimatic.

These diagrams [22] show
w the intended shading
performance of mature deciduouss trees, and the principles
of how siting trees of sufficient heeight close to the external
wall gives a high level of summeer shade to the windows,
while admitting desirable winter solar warmth. Although
even the shade of leafless trees in winter causes a reduction
in overall solar gain, hence the difference between 9%
gross tree shelter energy saving an
nd 7% to 8.8% net saving.
There is recent research evidence to show that shade from
well watered large mature trees can reduce UK summertime
temperatures by as much as 5 to
t 7 deg C compared to
temperatures in the full sun. Thiis Manchester University
study endorses earlier US researcch. “US researchers have
shown that tree shade on building
gs can reduce summer air
conditioning costs by 5%.”[23] “T
The shelter and shade from
trees can save up to 10% of the energy
e
needed to heat and
cool nearby buildings. They also reduce the effects of air
pollution and make outdoorr spaces much more
comfortable.”[24] Strategic gaps can
c be left in the spacing
between the trees to maintain summer
s
views from key
windows. “Isolated trees will prov
vide more cooling per unit
area than clumps of trees”….whilee “Well-watered trees will
provide more cooling than drough
hted ones.” [23] “Primarytreated wastewater may be used
d for irrigation of park
vegetation” [25], design consideraation may need to be given
in future to routing appropriate waaste water to planting.

4.1. Passive Solar Design Principles (P
PSD)
The UK Dept of Energy and Climate Change predict
that mandated green measures alone will iincrease energy
bills 30% by 2020 [18]. It has recently beeen claimed that.
“in contemporary housing up to 20–25% oof heating and
lighting energy can be saved by the application of PSD
principles.” [19] Nevertheless there is no cleear strategy yet,
despite the proposed green deal, to compel thhe adaptation of
existing housing stock, 26 million approximaately in the UK,
and 1.3 million approximately in Wales, off which varying
predictions claim 75% to over 80% will sttill be in use in
2050. This remains the elephant in the rooom. It may be
suggested that not enough research has taaken place into
those PSD measures that can benefit exxisting housing,
through retrofit, when orientation for exampple can only be
optimised at the design stage. PSD maxim

Sudden changes
in external conditions may cause significant discomfort,
unless transitional acclimatisation spaces arre incorporated,
and housing designed or modified for greaater stability in
internal conditions. More extreme climaate events are
predicted that risk these sudden changes [5]. This paper
claims that external shading and wind sheltter can assist in
moderating external usable space, formiing transitional
spaces [20], sheltering existing and new buildings, and
creating an external temperate environmentt for maintained
bio-diversity. There are numerous argum
ments made for
sustainable bio-diversity. We focus on thee ‘daily contact
with nature that so many obtain from urbaan public green
spaces’. The physical and physiological efffects of this are
claimed measurable and increase with speciees richness [21].

4.3. Tree used as Shelter Beltss and other barriers
The PSA research in the 198
80s claimed “winds faster
than 2m/second cause significant heat losses due to excess
undary layers attached to
ventilation, loss of warm air bou
building services and their replaccement by colder air. The
result is greater indoor – outdoorr temperature differences.
These differences also help to drive the ‘stack effect’

5% for housing in the south of Britain.

owing to the additional benefits of tree sheelter cooling in
summer [16]. To date there has been littlle research that
challenges these findings. Appropriately positioned tree
shelter belts or other barriers are also fouund valuable in
reducing undesirable super-cold airflow. Super-cooled air
may reduce temperatures as much as 8 deg C due to
katabatic air movement which ‘ponds’ in ffrost pockets or
frost hollows. “It was under such condditions that the
temperature fell to -23.3 °C, the lowest evver recorded in
Wales, at Rhyader on 21 January 1940.”[26]

4.4. Other considerations
Selected tree species can substantially reduce local
pollution (by up to 40%), and shelterbeelts in general
contribute to noise reduction, such as trafficc noise [27]. In
addition there is greatly more potential to bbe derived from
tree biomass than is currently exploited in the UK. At
present, only around 40% of the annual increment in
England’s woodlands is harvested and utilised within
existing markets.” “Arboricultural arisingss are the wood
from felling, pruning and safety operationss carried out on
trees in built up areas and along transportt corridors. The
Woodfuel Resource Study estimated that 688% of this wood
does not currently find a market, the maj
ajority going to
landfill.”[28] CABE Space (now the Designn Council) made
a direct link between perceived attractive ggreen space and
increased land values. They extend tthis to green
infrastructure: “a network of clearly linkedd green spaces,
rather than isolated parks, potentially contributes to
spreading the value uplift across a wider area….Housing
layouts that allow for greater sight lines intoo and out of the
park and for more reference to other adjaceent spaces allow
the park’s influence on value to spreaad” [29]. One
comparative study concluded that the UK w
will benefit more
from tree shelter, and that in Greece and ssimilar climates
vertical planting may be more beneficial [300]. On the other
hand the PSA study stated for the UK thhat it is worth
considering whether the maintenance iissues can be
managed of using climbing plants up the waalls, since these
‘add coolness to walls, enhance dryness and so reduce
energy loss, and add roughness so reducing wind speed.’ In
the design of the external insulation finishh consideration
could be given to methods of training cclimbing plants
without reducing security by providing handd holds [16]. An
argument may also be made for proportionattely more shrub
or tree planting in place of grass. The Secuured by Design
guidance recommends that: “Propertyy boundaries,
particularly those at the side and rear, whicch adjoin public
land, need to be secure... A substantial buffeer planted on the
outside of the fence line may help to discouurage intruders”
“Neighbourhood permeability… is one of the community
level design features most reliably linked to crime rates,
and the connections operate consistentlyy in the same
direction across studies: more permeabilityy, more crime.”
“The correct use of certain species of plantts such as spiny
or thorny shrubs can help prevent graffiti annd loitering and
create or enhance perimeter security.” [31] Further, “one

4.6. Some tools for assessing micro-climate

Some tools are emerging thaat enable the comparative
holistic evaluation of one design scheme with another for

its contribution to local enviro
carried out by the development control authorities in the
he North American city of
German city of Berlin [33] and th
Seattle [34], has provided a useful insight into the
contribution which various landsccape measures can make,
and the need for increased biodiversity in the built
environment. The Biotope Areaa Factor and the Seattle
Green Factor provide a framewo
ork against which surface
permeability and levels of biodiv
versity can be measured,
and present a detailed strateegy for assessing the
effectiveness and relative cost imp
plications associated with

507

a range of landscape features. The goals of the Biotope
Area Factor are those of: “safeguarding and improving the
microclimate and atmospheric hygiene; safeguarding and
developing soil function and water balance; creating and
enhancing the quality of the plant and animal habitat;
improving the residential environment.” To these the
Seattle Green Factor specifically adds the encouragement of
“larger plants, permeable paving, green roofs, vegetated
walls, preservation of existing trees, and layering of
vegetation along streets and other areas visible to the
public. Bonuses are provided for food cultivation, native
and drought-tolerant plants, and rainwater harvesting.” [34]
While these goals are worthy and encourage comparative
evaluation of alternatives, they do so in a similar manner to
the building regulation compliance tools discussed above.
There is still a complementary requirement for more
effective bio-climatic performance simulation tools. At the
macro or strategic level a number of GIS based approaches
exist for modelling planning decision outcomes and
evaluating alternatives, such as GRASS, IDRISI and
ESRI.[35] More specialised tools have been developed such
as: UrbanSim linked to Urban Ecosystem Modelling [36];
CAST[37];and i-Tree [38]. Landscape is inherently not
static, and some techniques tend to “gloss over” this aspect
of change over time. “Urban plant ecosystems can be
interpreted as being managed directly by the city residents
and employees and indirectly by the geometry of the urban
surroundings.”[39] At the micro level there are few usable
tools available. One or two prototype standalone tools exist
such as Envi-met [40]. This models: “flow around and
between buildings; exchange processes of heat and vapour
at the ground surface and at walls; turbulence; exchange at
vegetation and vegetation parameters; bioclimatology; and
particle dispersion.” Trees are modelled in the plant.dat file,
and further tree data can be added, however the issue arises
in obtaining more specific tree data outlined above, such as
leaf diameter, aerodynamic properties, or leaf or root area
density. Most users may therefore stick to the supplied data
and hence approximate more than may be desirable. EnviMet development is continuing towards supporting
visualisation or the inclusion of 3D topography. Some
practitioners meld use of Envimet with building
performance simulation [41]. Yet architectural designers
would ideally wish to integrate their usual visual design
models with complementary visual analytical tools. This is
efficiently achieved by modelling once, and transferring
that model between packages iteratively in a process of
refinement and analysis. To this end the leading Building
Information Modelling (BIM) packages use Industry
Foundation Classes (IFC) as the primary exchange format.
The Building Smart consortium has been developing this
exchange format since the early 1990’s. There has been an
attempt to extend the IFC format towards geographic
information as the proposed IFC2x3g standard. However
this is a simple exchange of some key BIM and GIS (GML
based) data such as topography and geo-referencing. Trees
can be defined as IFC proxy objects, but this approach

omits all the higher level semantic or parametric data that
would enable interoperable transfer to be of significant use.
“These function as objects but make no assertion as to their
function or role.”[42] CityGML is an emerging standard for
3D urban modelling, and it contains specific vegetation
objects such as: Hedge, Tree, Waterobject, River, Lake,
Ditch, Jetty, and can be further extended. Work is
underway on effective translators between BIM/IFC and
CityGML, however these are complicated by the difference
between on the one hand an IFC element based volume
model, and on the other a GML based topographic surface
model [43]. In this work trees do not appear as a priority.
The GBXML exchange format is used between a number of
BIM software packages and some building performance
simulation software packages. This, in its v5.0 schema,
does define trees and other landscape features as objects. It
is not so clear how much other semantic information (such
as root density, leaf diameter) about the tree can be
transferred from one package to another in a useful
roundtrip. It may be concluded that the use of these tools by
the average architectural designer and finding a way to
integrate the different modelling and analytical applications
remains a maze.

Conclusions
The design of external spaces around dwellings will
become more important as changes in lifestyle and levels of
outdoor activity are likely to increase, in a natural response
to changed climatic conditions. It may be predicted that if
we continue in the UK in general and Wales in particular to
build housing that, in its fabric, risks overheating, as
appears to be the current norm, then external contextual
environment adaptation measures may become increasingly
critical. It is suggested that the current regulations and
codes focus overmuch on the building and so the external
contextual environment is not addressed with the
importance that it deserves. This is compounded because
the use of integrated micro-climate simulation with building
and urban modelling tools by the average architectural
designer remains a maze. More data, more research, and
better tools and file data exchange are all necessary.
