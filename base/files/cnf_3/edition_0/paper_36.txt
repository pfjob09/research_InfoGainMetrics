Abstract
Visual clustering provides effective tools for
understanding relationships among clusters in a data
space. This paper applies an adaptation of the standard
Self-Organizing Map for visual temporal clustering in
exploring the customer base and tracking customer
behavior of a department store over a 22-week period. In
contrast to traditional clustering techniques, which often
provide a static snapshot of the customer base and
overlook the possible dynamics, the Self-Organizing
Time Map enables exploring complex patterns over time
by visualizing the results in a user-friendly way. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the application using
department store data with more than half a million rows
of weekly aggregated customer information.

and projection via neighborhood-preservation. The
effectiveness of the SOM in customer segmentation has
been demonstrated in a number of studies [4-6].
These segmentation solutions often provide only a
static snapshot of the underlying customer base.
However, the customer base itself and customers’
purchasing behavior are not static but evolve over time,
especially during sales events. A segmentation based on
a specific timeframe might overlook possible dynamics
in the interim. Therefore, providing a holistic view of
multivariate temporal patterns for better understanding of
customers is the main focus of this paper.
The SOM literature has provided several
enhancements for temporal processing. Often, time is
introduced implicitly in post-processing (e.g., trajectories
[7]). The activation and learning rule (e.g., Hypermap [8])
and network topology (e.g., Temporal SOM [9]) have
also been adapted for temporal processing. The standard
SOM has also been paired with various visualization
techniques for better spatiotemporal visualization (e.g.,
[10]). Yet, the problems of visualizing changes in
inherent data structures over time and disentangling the
temporal dimensions and cross-sectional structures still
need to be addressed differently. The recently introduced
Self-Organizing Time Map (SOTM) [11] provides a
visual means for this type of exploratory temporal
structure analysis.
In this paper, we use customers’ demographic and
behavioral characteristics and apply the SOTM for 1)
performing multivariate clustering of customers over
time; 2) visualizing the temporal variation of the
multivariate patterns; and 3) detecting and interpreting
complex patterns of changes in the customer base and
purchasing behavior during three special sales events.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 describes the SOTM. Section 3 documents the
data used in the study, the experiments with the SOTM
and analysis of the results. Finally, we summarize the
key findings in Section 4.

1. Introduction
Over the past decades, the focus of modern
companies has been shifting from being product-oriented
to customer-centric. In recent years, this change has been
particularly rapid due to the increasing interest in
customer relationship management (CRM) [1]. CRM
begins with customer identification, i.e., to understand
customers’ demographic, behavioral and attitudinal
characteristics. Customer segmentation is an effective
approach to customer understanding and identification. It
divides the customer base into distinct and internally
homogeneous groups. Effective segmentation enables
companies to interact with customers in each segment
collectively, such as formulating marketing strategies
aimed at different segments.
Various clustering algorithms, e.g., distance- and
density- based techniques, have been used to approach
the segmentation task. Recently, visualization techniques
have gained in popularity for understanding and
assessing clustering results [2]. The Self-Organizing Map
(SOM) [3] is a well-known and widely used method for
visual clustering of high dimensional data. Unlike most
clustering algorithms that require post-processing for
understanding cluster structures, the SOM is unique
for its simultaneous clustering via vector quantization

seeming complex, are nothing more than aggregated
qualities of the one-dimensional SOMs (for details see
[11]):

2.1. Self-Organizing Time Map
The SOTM [11] uses the capabilities of the SOM for
abstraction of temporal structural changes in data. In
principle, the SOTM applies one-dimensional SOMs on
data ordered in consequent time units. These onedimensional SOMs are then set in an ascending order of
time to have one axis representing time topology and one
representing data topology.
To observe the cross-sectional structures of the
dataset for each time unit t (where t={1,2,…,T}), the
SOTM performs a mapping from the input space Ω(t),
with a probability density function p(x,t), onto a onedimensional array A(t) of output units mi(t) (where
i=1,2,…,M). To preserve the orientation between
consecutive patterns, the SOTM uses short-term
memory. In particular, when t=1 the first principal
component of principal component analysis (PCA) is
used for initializing A(t); otherwise, the reference vectors
of A(t-1) initialize A(t). Adjustment to temporal changes
is achieved by performing a batch update per time t.
Thereafter, the timeline is created by arranging A(t) in an
ascending order of time t. The topology preservation of
the SOTM is hence twofold: the horizontal direction
preserves time topology and the vertical preserves data
topology. The SOTM follows the two-step procedure,
similarly as the SOM. Matching is performed by
min x (t ) − mi (t ) and the batch update by:

where u ( x j (t )) is the average proportion of x j (t ) ∈ Ω (t )
for which first and second BMUs (within A(t)) are nonadjacent units.

2.3. Visualizations of the SOTM
The multidimensionality of the SOTM is visualized
by feature plane representations. It shows for each
variable the temporal evolution of its cross-sectional
distribution. As for the standard SOM, the feature planes
are different views of the same map, where one unique
point represents the same node on all planes. We produce
the feature planes using heat map color coding, with cold
to warm colors representing low to high values according
to their own color scales. As for each feature plane the
color scale is common for the entire SOTM
(t={1,2,…,T}), the temporal changes in data distributions
are shown by variations in heat.
Sammon’s mapping [12], a multidimensional scaling
technique, is used for assessing the structural properties
of SOTMs. It tries to match the pairwise distances of the
SOTM nodes with their original distance in the highdimensional space, enabling examination of structural
properties at time t (vertically) and changes in structures
(horizontally). In a Sammon's mapping of a SOTM, we
plot all SOTM nodes (mi(t) where t={1,2,…,T}) to one
dimension. Then, we disentangle time by plotting the
SOTM nodes according to Sammon's dimension on the y
axis and time on the x axis, and retain neighborhood
relations by connecting lines to have a net-like
representation. Additionally, a coloring method by Kaski
et al. [13] is used for visualizing the cluster structure of
the SOTM. The well-known uniform color space CIELab
[14] is used, where the perceptual differences of the
colors represent the distances in the data space
approximated by the Sammon’s mapping. However, as
the SOMs of the SOTMs are one-dimensional, we only
use one dimension (blue to yellow) of the color space.

Characteristics of a SOTM can be quantified by a
number of quality measures from the standard SOM
paradigm: quantization error ε qe , distortion measure

In this section, we describe the data used in the
study and the experiment for choosing the model
specification. Then, we apply the SOTM to conduct
temporal customer segmentation demographically,

purchasing behavior.

3.1. Data

Thousands

The data used in this study are from a department
store that belongs to a large, multiservice corporation.
The dataset contains weekly aggregated sales
information per customer for the department store. The
data spans 22 weeks from September 2008 to January
2009. For each week, only active customers are included
in the data sets. The transaction data for each week were
aggregated to a set of customer-level behavioral
variables. To this end, we have weekly data on six
demographic variables and six behavioral variables.
Therefore, each observation in the data set is defined by
four components: the customer ID, the week number, a
set of demographic variables, and a set of behavioral
variables. The distribution of the number of customers
across the 22 weeks is illustrated in Figure 2. It is shown
that week 40 (Sales event A), week 46 (Sales event B)
and pre-Christmas weeks (weeks 50 and 51) attract more
customers than average.

As mentioned previously, the purchasing behavior
variables are summarized from a massive transaction
database to weekly aggregated customer data.
• Purchase frequency: Average number of
transactions per day.
• Basket size: Average number of items per
transaction.
• Average item value: Average value per item
purchased.
• Average transaction value: Average value per
purchase transaction.
• Working time transaction: The percentage of
purchases made from Mon - Fri, 9am – 5pm.
• Number of categories: Average total number of
distinct product groups purchased in each
transaction.

Only demographic variables are used in training
SOTMs. This enables the assessment of not only
differences in demographics, but also in their associated
purchasing behavior. Each variable is pre-processed by
scaling by range for the training as well as postprocessed back to their normal distributions for the
visualizations.

3.2. Experiments
In this section, we test different specifications and
architectures of the SOTM. The SOTM requires the user
to set the number of nodes on the y and x axis. While the
number of time units sets the x dimension, the number of
clusters on the y axis is less straightforward. We set the
number of time units to 22 to span the sales events of
interest. The number of clusters is set to five according to
the optimal number of customer segments in a previous
static study on a pooled version of this data set [15].
Hence, we obtain a SOTM with 5x22 nodes, where five
nodes represent data topology for a specific week on the
vertical direction and 22 the time dimension in terms of
weeks on the horizontal direction.
Figure 3 illustrates the quality measures of the
SOTM with neighborhood radii ranging from 0.4 to 8. It
is shown that the topographic error decreases gradually
to zero and stabilizes when the neighborhood radius
increases to 1.2; meanwhile, the quantization error starts
to increase significantly. Therefore, we chose the SOTM
with the neighborhood radius of 1.2 for a good balance
between topology preservation and fit to data.

The variables used in this study fall into two bases:
demographic and purchasing behavior variables. A brief
explanation of these variables follows. The demographic
variables show background data about the customers.
• Gender: 0 for male and 1 for female.
• Estimated probability of children: The higher
the value of this variable is, the more likely
there are children living in the household.
The values range from 1 to 10.
• Estimated income level: The higher the value,
the wealthier the household is considered to be.
Possible values are 1, 2 and 3.
• Loyalty point level: Based on the average
purchase amount per customer in the
corporation, this variable divides customers into
five classes: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. A higher value in
loyalty point level indicates a larger historical
spending amount in the entire corporate chain.

Note: The figure represents a SOTM model with 5x22 nodes, where five nodes represent data topology for a specific week on the vertical
axis and 22 the time dimension in terms of weeks for a specific segment on the horizontal axis. The perceptual differences of the colors,
as defined by a color scale consisting of 15 colors, reflect the differences in the distances between the SOTM nodes. Due to small
changes over time on the horizontal axis, each row of nodes forms an own segment, as labeled on the left side (Seg.1 - Seg.5).

information across segments (represented with the
vertical dimension), time (represented with the horizontal
dimension), and multiple variables (represented by the
feature planes). This provides a holistic view of how the
characteristics of customer segments, as well as their
distribution, evolve over time.
Using the feature planes, we can observe some
general characteristics of the customer segments. For
instance, male customers are located in the nodes on the
lowest part of the map (cf. Fig. 6(a)), i.e., Segment 1 in
Figure 4. Figure 6(b) and Figure 6(c) show that
customers with children at home and high income
customers are located in the middle and lower parts of
the map. Customers with high loyalty point levels and
service levels are located in the lower part of the map (cf.
Fig. 6(d) and Fig. 6(e)). Elderly customers are located on
the second horizontal row on the map and young in the
two rows below, as illustrated in Figure 6(f). It should be
noted that the lowest average age in the segments is as
high as 40 years as indicated in the color scale in Figure
6(f). The demographic characteristics of each segment
are summarized as follows:

3.3. Temporal customer segmentation
The obtained SOTM is shown in Figure 4. Above
the figure, we show the events of interest, and on the left
side are the five segments. It should be noted that the
segment number is an indication of the location of the
nodes; however, the data in the horizontally neighboring
nodes are still allowed to change overtime. The
perceptual differences of the colors in the figure reflect
the differences in the distances between the SOTM
nodes. Due to the small horizontal changes, as are also
illustrated in the Sammon’s mapping in Figure 5, the
color differences are hardly discernible. In the Sammon’s
mapping, each point represents the corresponding
segment; the vertical solid connections represent data
topology and the dashed horizontal connections show
time topology on the SOTM. The mapping confirms that
the temporal changes are gradual, equal and small, but
that the vertical differences between Segments 1 and 2
and Segments 4 and 5 are relatively large. It also reveals
that the differences between Segments 2 and 3 increase
overtime.
The multidimensionality of Figure 4 can be
described using feature plane representations, illustrated
in Figure 6. These feature planes are essentially a series
of two-dimensional views of the customers, showing

level (cf. Fig 6(e)) in Segment 4. This change is also
displayed in the Sammon’s mapping in Figure 5 with the
small increased vertical differences between Segments 4
and 5 during that period. There is also a slight decrease
in the age of shopping customers belonging to Segments
1 and 5 for week 52 (cf. Fig 6(f)). However, while the
composition of customers in segments changes over
time, the temporal changes in segment characteristics are
small, which is also confirmed in the Sammon’s mapping
in Figure 5.
The frequency map (cf. Fig. 6(g)) gives a visual
indication of the number of customers in each segment.
It shows that Sales event A (week 40), and the week of
Christmas (week 51) attract more customers than Sales
event B (week 46), as confirmed by the larger proportion
of yellow and red nodes. It is also found that male
customers (Seg. 1) and younger high-income female
customers with high loyalty points and service levels and
a high chance of having children at home (Seg. 2) are
more likely to react to the sales events.

to high service level.

probability of children, high estimated income,
high loyalty point level and high service level.
Seg. 3: Female customers with low age, high
probability of children, medium estimated

service level.
Seg. 4: Elderly female customers with low
probability of children, medium estimated
income, low loyalty point level and medium to
low service level.
Seg. 5: Female customers with medium age,
low probability of children, low estimated
income, low loyalty point level and low service
level.

By observing changes in the horizontal direction, we
can observe temporal changes in the segments. Figure 6
shows that the pre-Christmas period attracts customers
with higher loyalty point level (cf. Fig 6(d)) and service

segments. In addition, the frequency map (also shown in
Figure 6(g)) is included in Figure 7(g) as well for
interpreting the behavioral patterns. Figure 7(g) shows
that the number of shopping customers in Segments 2
and 3 is larger than in the other segments, but that the
sizes of all segments increased for Sales event A
comparing to the preceding weeks, meaning that the
customers in all segments actively responded to the
event.
Sales event B (week 46) differs from A in that
customers are less activated in terms of purchase
frequency, number of items purchased and basket size.
However, customers tended to buy more expensive
products (cf. Fig. 7(c)) than during Sales event A,
leading to a higher transaction value (cf. Fig. 7(d)). In
addition, the proportion of transactions made during
working hours was significantly lower during this week,
especially for Segments 1 and 3.
Christmas also exhibits some interesting patterns.
The final pre-Christmas week (week 51) attracted many
more customers than usual (cf. Fig. 7(g)). Customers
tended to buy medium to low priced products (cf. Fig.
7(c)) with small baskets (cf. Fig. 7(b)), thereby leading to
the lower spending amount (cf. Fig. 7(d)) than during the
preceding weeks. In addition to week 51, pre-Christmas
week 49 attracted some large spenders (cf. Fig. 7(d)).
During the Christmas and post-Christmas weeks (i.e.,
weeks 52 and 1), male Customers (Seg. 1) also tended to
buy more expensive products (cf. Fig. 7(c)), leading to
the high average transaction value (cf. Fig. 7(d)). Table
1 summarizes key information regarding the abovementioned sales events.

3.4. Temporal behavior analysis
In contrast to the demographic variables used in
training and analyzed in section 3.3, the behavioral
variables had no impact on forming the segmentation
result, but their distributions among the segments in the
5x22 SOTM grid are shown in the associated feature
planes in Figure 7. The temporal changes of customers’
purchasing behavior are, compared with demographic
profiles, large and volatile. Figure 7 can be examined
vertically to detect differences among the five segments
during a specific week, and horizontally for detecting
changes in a certain segment over time. For example,
Figure 7(a) shows that the purchase frequency of
customers in Seg. 1 is much lower than that of the rest of
the segments during Sales event A (week 40). However,
the purchase frequency of customers in Seg. 1 did
increase during Sales event A, compared to the preceding
and succeeding weeks.
The effects of the sales events and pre-Christmas
sales are indeed clear. By examining the feature planes
horizontally, Figures 7(a, b and f) show that customers
went to the department store most frequently, bought
more kinds of products, and more of them, during the
week-long Sales event A (week 40). However, customers
mainly bought low-priced products (cf. Fig. 7(c)) and
their average transaction value (cf. Fig. 7(d)) was no
higher than those of the other weeks. By examining the
figure vertically, it can be seen that customers in Seg. 1
had a lower purchase frequency, basket size, and number
of product categories purchased, but more expensive
products and higher spending amount than the rest of the

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we have applied SOTM for tracking
customers’ demographics and behavior for a department
store over time. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
method on a case company’s multivariate customer
database with weekly data. The temporal customer
segmentation is visualized by a series of feature planes,
which provides a holistic view of the customer base and
their purchasing behavior over time. The SOTM
effectively detects the changes in customer behavior
during sales events. The results show that the purchasing
behavior of customers changes during the events, but at
the same time, that the sales events differ in the type of
shopping behavior that they trigger. The results are
meaningful and interpretable, and indicate that the
SOTM can serve as a valuable visual exploratory tool for
decision makers to see how successful the sales events
have been as to different criteria and to aid in decision
making on which kind of sales events they should have.
For business analysts it can also be used to drill down
into the interesting patterns revealed for further analysis.
