Abstract
The transfer of knowledge from research laboratories and
academic seminars to the industrial/commercial sector is
a strategically important issue. Text analysis of journal
papers and patent documents, written by one scientist and
his team in the specialist area of semiconductor physics,
has been performed in order to visualize the cross-over of
research knowledge onto patented artifacts. The results
shows the time lag in the cross-over and will serve to
bring knowledge visualization and information extraction
techniques in the rather quantitative arena of strategic
policy making in science and its application to
technology.

1. Introduction
The transformation of ideas in science into artefacts in
technology is a complex process. The ideas are explored
by building systems of concepts and by performing
experiments in laboratories. The artefacts in themselves
go through a transformation from early industrial
prototypes to finished goods and services. As ideas are
intangible they are usually articulated in journal papers
and conference proceedings; the artefacts are tangible
and are articulated through journals/conferences with an
applications focus and through patent applications.
Scientists, individually and collectively, write in their
natural or everyday language, and specialise the meaning
of certain words or create new words to express novelty
of their ideas, experiments or artefacts. This specialising
process leads over time to the creation of a specialist
language which is rooted in everyday or general language
but distinguished by the frequent use of specialist terms
[1][2]. A scientist weaves a web of words – a text – in
order to persuade his or her peers of the ideas that may
have inspired the scientist. And, sometimes a scientist
writes to dissuade his or her readers from the ideas which
the readers may hold.

The writing of individual specialists in a field of
science or technology is woven into a bigger web – the
collection of texts that form the output of the specialism: a
corpus of texts. This corpus may span tens of years of
work and is perhaps the only trace or evidence left behind
by the scientists or technologists.
Current work on the so-called knowledge maps directly
or indirectly uses absence/presence, and generally
frequency of the occurrence of terms and named entities
as a part of a distance metric. Documents using some
terms (and named entities) are clustered together and
documents using different terms and named entities are
separated.
The weave of words and that of texts is interlinked by
the use of a common set of terms and by reference to a
group of named scientists. The terms – mainly nouns and
adjectives – noun combinations, and the names of
scientists are conspicuous by their frequent use.
Frequency is regarded as a correlate of acceptability:
sometimes new coinages, referred to as neologisms, are
conspicuous due to their infrequent usage. Scientometrics
and bibliometrics rely on the axiom of frequency as a
correlate of acceptability.
Work in knowledge
visualisation indirectly subscribes to the axiom as well
with the difference that a cluster of documents that use
one or more names, can be visualised [3][4][5].
The texts of a specialism written in one language can
be organised and analysed synchronically or
diachronically. A synchronic analysis can be used to
describe a ‘state’ of the specialism disregarding whatever
changes might be taking place. The opposite of the
synchronic is the diachronic analysis where text analysed
to help in understanding the historical development of the
specialism. Similar analyses of patent documents may
yield information relating to a technology at a fixed point
in time or relating to the historical development of the
technology. In both the cases, that of science and
technology, the synchronic and diachronic analysis may
be started by looking for the most frequent terms and the
most frequently names persons.

More recent of these studies include that of Stengerge
on RISC (Reduce Instruction Set Computer system) [7]
and of Meyer who has analysed patent documents to
establish
a
technology-transfer
link
between
developments in what he calls nano-science and nanotechnology [6]. Meyer has carried out extensive text
analysis on the distribution of keywords that were prechosen. In our method of text analysis the terms are
automatically extracted by a computer system without any
human intervention [2][7].
Chen [4] has developed the use of citation analysis
techniques for tracking change within a discipline. He
plots a rank ordered list of most popular works in a field:
essentially, what is plotted is the rank of the authors of the
works. The implication here is this: each author may
have a preference for a (set of) concepts(s) by virtue of
having developed the concept(s) or having skilfully using
the concept(s) – any change in a diachronically organised
list of ranked authors can perhaps be related to change in
concept(s). Chen argues that such a plot can be used to
display the so-called paradigm shift within a discipline.
The term paradigm has over 20 senses of term defined by
the modern originator of the term, the philosopher of
science, the late Thomas Kuhn. A paradigm shift leads
either to the disestablishment of an existing stock of
terms, and hence perhaps concepts, or the establishment
of a new conceptual hegemony. Chen had given himself
a considerable challenge.
An investigation into the transformation of ideas into
artefacts may require us to see the distribution of terms
and citations (to named persons) in journal papers at time
t and to contrast this distribution with the distribution of
the same terms and citations in the patent documents at
time t + Ìt, where Ìt is the length of an arbitrary
interval: Ìt can be a measure of the lag between the
discovery of an idea and the production of an artefact.

diode…
[From the Penguin Dictionary of Electronics 1998
London: Penguin Books, p135]
The above definition of diode uses around 130 words,
a majority of which are closed class words (e.g. a, the,
any, that, their, those). Around 10% of the 130 words or
so comprise the term diode. This indeed is the message
from the writer to his or her reader: the meaning of the
term diode transmitted by a simple (linguistic) device of
repetition. Every repetition increases the frequency of the
term and every repetition is intended to reinforce a
message. Contrariwise, the lack of repetition, or no
repetition, is a conscious or subconscious attempt by the
author to omit or discredit a message that may be
symbolically encoded and transmitted through the agency
of a term (or a named entity).
The frequent repetition of the few terms, literally
hundreds or thousands of times within one or more texts,
is either an attempt to establish or to introduce the few
terms in the literature of a given science or technology.
These few terms are related to (even fewer) concepts.
The repetition of a term may be construed as an attempt to
establish a concept; usually such an attempt is made
through publications of journal papers. Equally, the
repetition may be an attempt to use an established concept
usually in journal papers and in textbooks. The repetition
of one or more terms in patent documents may be
references to the concept(s) underlying a (potentially)
patentable artefact.
A prototypical knowledge map for us is a graph whose
notes are terms (or named entities) and whose links are
used to denote strengths of association between two or
more terms.

2. Knowledge Maps and Lexical Signature

Our preferred term is lexical signature: the author or
authors imprinting their notion of how things are or
should be by simply repeating a few terms or names.

More frequently used terms and names that are
repeated throughout the texts span sentence boundaries.
Sometimes the terms are used in themselves, sometimes
abbreviated and at other times used through pronominal
reference or through an equivalent term (synonymy) or
through related terms (hyponymy). Consider the
definition of the diode:
Diode: Any electronic device that has only two
electrodes. There are several different types of diode,
their voltage characteristics […] Diodes are most
commonly used as rectifiers; those used for others
purposes […] The semiconductor diode consists of a
simple p-injunction. Current flows when […]
Reverse bias produces…The noun obsolete vacuum

In order to illustrate the notion of lexical signature we
will use the works of Leo Esaki, a Japanese-born Nobel
Laureate who was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize in
Physics, jointly with Ivar Giaver and Brian Josephson.
Leo Esaki is a prolific writer and mentor of young
scientists and colleagues in that many of his 66
publications in journals, and all 21 of his patent
documents filed at the US patents and trademarks office,
were jointly authored. The journal papers were mainly
published in the American Physical Society’s Physical
Review (55 papers) and by the International Vacuum
Science and Technology’s Journal (11 papers). The 21
patent documents were filed with the US Patents and
Trademark Office.

The single terms most frequently used by Esaki and his
collaborators over the four or five decades are; band,
energy, field, electron, state, hole, structure, superlattice,
layer, magnetic. The above layout of terms is in order of
their frequency rank: ‘band’ and ‘energy’ together
comprise just over 1% of the 148,000 or so single words
that comprise all the journal papers written by Esaki and
colleagues during 1950-1990s. These ten most frequent
terms make up just under 5% of the texts. Note that 1% is
indeed a large number in that 20 closed-class words,
including the determiners (a, an, the, some, many),
conjunctions (and, but, if), prepositions (of, in) and verbs
(be, do), comprise around half of all the texts of each of
the 66 papers; 20 words comprise 50% of all the 66
papers [The word the alone comprises over 5% al the 66
papers]. The other 50% comprise thousands of (single)
words which are mainly nouns, adjectives and adverbs.
What of the compound word terms? These terms are
used when there is a need for greater specificity as single
word terms typically refer to more generic concepts
specific in their articulating of a scientific than single
word terms. Table 2 shows the rank ordering of single
word and compound noun terms in the journal articles of
Esaki. The rank order shows frequency order.1 indicates
highest, 2 second highest and so on. Note that we have
merged the frequency of a term in its singular form with
that of its plural form: so when we suggest band(s) is the
highest ranked term (=1), that it is the highest frequency
term, we mean that band and bands together are highest
ranked reflecting the establishment of the concept
underlying the term band – a band in semiconductor
physics is described as ‘a closely spaced group of atomic
energy levels’; hence energy band or valence bands. The
same merger had been carried out on compound. This
merger is carried out with any loss of generality.

The rank ordering shows how productive Esaki and
colleagues, like many other scientists, have been in the
use of a small set of words to create their texts. The
frequent single words are used in most compounds
sometimes making up the entire compound term. Figure
1 show this productivity of the term band in their use
individually and as embedded in a term acting as the head
of the compound (e.g. valence band) or acting as a
collocate to a head (e.g. band edge).

Figure 1. The productive use of the terms band. The
figures subscripting the terms indicate their rank

The neologism created by Esaki and colleagues is the
term superlattice. This is his key ‘message’: How to
make faster switching devices for computers yet to be
manufactured, using a fabricated arrangement of atoms or
molecules in well defined and regular locations with
respect to each other. The term superlattice and its plural
superlattices have the 8th highest rank in the Esaki text
collecting. Figure 2 show this productivity of the term
superlattices and its compounds based on it.
How does Esaki’s vocabulary change over time? Table 3
shows the five most frequent terms used by Esaki and
colleagues in each of the five decades. The terms initially
used by Esaki in the 1950s have more or less been
abandoned at least in the most frequently used cluster.
The later decades include bands, fields, states, with
electrons and holes making an appearance as well.

The five most frequent terms make up 3% of the texts
published in each of the decades, suggesting again the use
of repetition as a device to home in a message.
How does the use of key compounds change over
time? What would be useful would to be select the
highest ranked term and the two ends of our text
collection, 1950s and 1990s, and study the change in their
usage (Tables 4a and 4b). We see the disappearance of the
most frequently used compound term hall coefficient and
specific resistivity from Esaki’s vocabulary over the time
period. Valence bands appear to be Esaki’s abiding
interest. The other end of the time series (1990s) shows
the emergence of new terms in the 5 most frequently
compound terms.

The focus on electronic properties and interaction
(Table 4b) in the 1990 on silicon based materials is
reflected in the most frequent compound word si atom.
The relatively new concepts associated with term like
resonant tunnelling have been gaining ground as

manifested in the higher frequency of the use of these
terms.

Tables 2 to 4 show how Esaki developed as a scientist
over a 40 year period. Some of his terminology has
remained intact whilst he has dropped some of the terms
and adapted and coined new terms in his writings.

3. Lexical signature and consolidation of
knowledge
Patent documents are written to assert proprietary
rights over a device or the methods of its design and
production. These documents are similar to journal
papers in many respects in that they are (partly) written in
the specialist language of technology in which the device
etc. is to be patented; a patent document cites previous
relevant work and comments on the effectiveness or
otherwise of existing devices. The other part of a patent
document is written in legal English or legal Chinese.
Despite the differences, the author of a journal paper uses
the same linguistic device, that of repetition, as his or her
counterpart who partly authors the patent document.
Esaki’s patents are a case in point as we will show below.
The first patent was granted to Esaki in 1970. Note that
there is a 20 year gap between Esaki’s first journal
publication and his first patent – there is little relation
between the two but this gap suggests a long build up in
technology transfer from research to prototypical devices.
The 78,000 words corpus of Esaki et al’s patent
documents shows the preponderance of a few frequent
single word terms on the whole, and that these single
words are used productively to form the basis of
compound terms (Table 5 and Figures 5a and 5b).
The diachronic variation of terms over the 30-year
period in Esaki’s patents shows a gradual change in the
choice of single word, with the term semi-conductor
disappearing from the top 5 in the 1990s as the term
became very generic and is perhaps being slowly replaced
by its more specific, and widely used, manifestations.
A diachronic comparison of the key terms in the 1970s
with the rest of the two decades shows Esaki and

If we use 1990s as a benchmark for key terms, we note
new interests of Esaki and colleagues, expressed through
terms like optoelectronic devices tunnel barrier (table 7b).

In the previous two sections, 2 and 3, we have
attempted to demonstrate how one can ascertain what we
call the lexical signature of the journal articles and that of
the patent documents. In the next section, we perform a
comparative analysis of the two lexical. These
comparative statements, in our view, can be used to
quantify statements about the more complex issue of
technology transfer.

4. Lexical signature and the crossover of
knowledge
It is an intuitive statement that research ideas and
experimentation form the basis of new devices, services,
methods and techniques. The research effort leads to the
creation of new knowledge, and to the suspension of ‘old’
knowledge, and this knowledge crosses-over into
technology. Perhaps a comparative analysis of the choice
of terms (lexical signature) will indicate the extent of this
cross-over. In this spirit of specialist knowledge still in
realms of research and not quite it making into the
construction of artefacts and vice versa, we have
compared the rank order of the most frequent words in the
journal corpus of Esaki’s papers with that of Esaki’s
patents corpus. For single words we can compare the
relative frequencies of usage as well. Consider the ten
most frequent terms in the journal corpus and in the patent
corpus in rank order.

Note that three terms are shared and have been
underlined. The focus on theoretical concepts in the
journal papers is evident by the use of terms like hole, an
absence of electrons acting like a positive charge, and
superlattice. The patent corpus is focused on practical and
patentable notions of device and layer, meaning layers of
elements used to make electronic components of
resistance, capacitance and inductance etc., and
materials.

When we compare the usage of the most frequent term
in one corpus with that of another we note that over a 50
year period, hole is used about 5 times as frequently in the
journal corpus than in the patent corpus followed closely
by the term field which was used about 4-5 times more
frequently. The term device, on the other hand is used
over 100 times more frequently in the patent corpus than
in the journal corpus, followed by the term region (10
times more frequently) materials (9 times) and
semiconductor (5 times more frequently). The word/term
invention was not found at all in the journal corpus. The
terms superlattice, energy and band have crossed over
recently in that they are used with the same frequency in
both the corpora.
In our view, the more interesting comparison is in the
frequent compound terms in both the corpora. Before we
describe this comparison it is important to remember that
the highest rank is denoted by the number 1 in a
frequency list is the most frequent. Terms of the lowest
frequency, that is those which only occur once, have the
lowest rank denoted by a high number. Terms of
frequency 1 have rank order of 35 and 30 in the journal
papers and patent document corpora respectively. Table 8
shows the comparison between the lexical signature of
compound words in the two corpora.
Apart from the term valence band which is ranked
second in both corpora, the rank order of almost all the
terms, amongst the ten most frequent, is quite different.
The term magnetic field, for controlling electron
movement amongst others, is the most frequent in the
journal corpus, but is fairly low ranked in the patent
corpus – 28th ranking terms just above the once–only cited
terms, that is cited only twice on the patent corpus of
78,000 words. The term quantum well is the 9th highestranking term in the journal corpus but has occurred only
once in the patent corpus. The 10th most frequent term
band offset was not found in the patent corpus at all.

On the other hand, the most frequent term in the
journal corpus energy band has a fairly low frequency in
the journal corpus being the 23rd rank amongst 30. The
terms with a suffix device are also conspicuous by their
absence in the journal corpus, i.e. storage device or by
having fairly low frequency, for example, semiconductor
device. Terms suffixed with the head region are also
largely absent in the journal corpus but are very frequent
in the patent corpus. Terms prefixed with superlattice
show variable behaviour with superlattice region
occurring only once in the journal corpus as opposed to
being the 7th in the patent corpus but superlattice
structure being quite frequent in both.

compound terms in the Esaki Papers and patents.

A final note on productivity of key single word terms:
the term band is used productively in both the corpora,
except for some which have not crossed over. Figure 6
shows the productive use of the term band in both
corpora.

5. Afterword
Our analysis shows that research papers and patent
documents can be distinguished somewhat on the basis of
single word and compound terms that were generated
automatically. The two lexical signatures show the
potential for identifying cross-over points in the transfer
of knowledge from the research arena to applications
domain.
We have deliberately focused on an individual, but a
prolific one, to establish our method which is documentbased and language inspired. The method will facilitate
the construction of knowledge maps in an objective and
systematic fashion. This method will help in establishing

how such a process can be facilitated.
