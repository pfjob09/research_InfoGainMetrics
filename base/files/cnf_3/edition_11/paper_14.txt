Abstract
7hi.s stugv shows a preliminary application of a
panorama video device Hvpercam in architecture-related
supervision of interior renovation. This is a PC-based
system thar takes 360 degree of scenes for recording or
una!v.si.s purposes. 7'he setup enables an installation
ulmost ut anv location. This studv proposes the
upplication of the supervision system in three categories:

und exemplification. The 8zpplication can be used in
supervision recording. coordination. review process
inspection, and process rebuild in construction.
Ke.wvords: panoramas, construction supervision

A construction prqject usually deals with a large
amount of information. The information management is
very effort-consuming [l-31. To facilitate a better
visualization. VR or 3D modeling are used in simulation
of works 15-71. But for on-site monitoring. it still needs
a large number of cameras to retrieve visual information
from different angles. A I-lypercam [4] is a device that
can be used to take 360 degree of panorama videos. The
CCD attached to the video lens of Hypercam (see Fig. 1)
can be connected to a camcorder or any recording device.
Bccause the video can capture up to 30 frames per
second. the I-lypercam records the surrounding
environment continuously. It can be carried as a
movable device or installed as a fixture (see Fig. 2 ) .

monitoring of remote site through Internet (see Fig. 4).
A program. ViewNet. is used to log in server to check
what's happing in a distance or from overseas. The
s y t e m can only control a paired zoom idout camera
from remote location only from server site. System
setting includes a KS-232 and two video (co-axial)
cables to transfer video and control signals to and from
site and the server. A 2.4 Gllz wireless device \viis tried
but the signal cotildn't transmit through concrete \valls

I he images captured in video clip shape like donuts
(see f-ig. 5 and Appendix R) that can he extracted one by

(sec f?g. 6). De-\varped panorama pictures are converted
into panorama scenes that are again connected into a

The recording and monitoring starts from electric

about 30 days. The video captured 30 fps i n donut shape
and recorded i n true color. The shape is de-\\arped into a
panoramic \.is\\o f 360 degree that lea\-es no blind spot.
The system creates a project-dependent database to
elplore the application of panorama records in depth.
This preliminary application is used to enhance or
replace the fiinctions of construction records. A
chronicle recordins of a space nith only one set of
H)percam s? stein is deployed.

The monitoring of an architectural construction site
not onl! has to check norking schedule. but also needs
elperienced supervisors to ensure t a s k are conducted to
design and specitications. Today construction sites are
getting larger and larger. If neighbors are also included.
the region would be too large for supervisors to monitor
complete surroundings. Recent technolog) uses t ideo
canieras to record site occurrences at certain important
spots through arrays of monitor screens. Those cameras
can only display specific angles, viewpoints, and spans.
Even the cameras can sweep back and forth periodicall).
time lag exists. Unless a large number of cameras are used.
a whole-view and chronicle recording can't be achieved.

3: System setup and interface
This paper presents an application of a patented
de\ice H\percain (the map camera or a mapcam) in
siiperi ising an interior constriiction site. tl! percam is a
360-degree panoraniic ideo camera. Associated \\ ith
recording control softnarc. it acts as a mapcam and can
zoom idout at a spot s i t h the help o f a n additional camera
(Speedorn).
The monitoring s?steni is de\eloped on a PC
platform (see Fig. 3) \+hich needs to be located near the
monitoring site. An important feature of the s~stemis the

4: Renovation Schedule
This experiment was tested in a remodeling project
about the size of 20mx20m. Whole interior renovation
took 30 days between February 6 and March 7. 2001 (see
Appendix A). There were 19 working items running from
one to seven days each. Not :ill items could be monitored
for two reasons. First, before item 3, new fireproofcoating
was applied to refurbished steel beams. The paint nccded
to be sprayed with room openings sealed in order to have
better control of coating thickness. Concerning the paint
might attach to camera covers, the renovation before thc
eleventh day was recorded by photos separately. Since this
study only applied one set of Hypercam and Speedom. thc
monitoring couldn't reach works outside this room. As a
result, 9 out of 19 items couldn't be seen from this system.
The Hypercam and Speedom were tixcd separately
on two pieces of 30cmx30cm plywood that is the same
size as a 30cmx30 module of ceiling tiles. They were
installed in room (see Fig. 7 ) . But before ceilings wcrc
installed and used for structural support, they were placcd
on a cable tray. Ceiling rails and tiles were installed

5: Checklist
The application of the sysicm is compared \\it11
checklist used commonly in site supervising \\orb. After

105

a preliminary study. a feasible application in terms of
checklist items is divided into three categories (see Tab. I),
such as the ones can be visual checked in a distance, the
ones need additional measurement (tightness or level to
confirm if a work is done), and the ones need supervisors
presented in person. The panoramic supervision is suitable
for the first type of work with explicit visual check like
the number of steel bars of a column or if a task is in
progress.
Original checklist is categorized into check methods.
inspection frequency. and emphasis for each construction
stage and item. Check methods are for the items suitable
for visual inspection or require numeric confirmation from
instrumental measurement. Inspection frequency refer to
two types of re-check: I ) case can be closed once
correction has been made; 2) the case needs periodical
inspection. Emphasis represents the types of description
used to describe a situation. such as "W" standing for text
is required to indicate if items match with contract
drawings or specification; "#" standing for data are
required to specify a correction or the amount of
displacement or level; or -*" standing for images are
required in addition to text and numeric data.
There are many categories and items included in
construction supervision. This study simplifies the

supervision and system setup by emphasizing tasks on
interior renovation and the fire-proof coating of
rehrbished structure. Working schedule started from
demolish clean-up to painting jobs. The functionality for
feasible check of explicit visual confirmation was
extended by applying an additional zoom idout camera,
except the check needs numeric measurement or
verification like coating thickness or of floor level.
Visual inspection in this application was originally
used for items can be explicitly specified in a distance.
The function was extended when a zoom camera was
applied for a closer look of an object. The result shows it
can even read small font text on a label of a can from 6
meter away. Future application would incorporate the
close-up function with on-site and imbedded measuring
instrument to simplify some types of inspection without
physical presence.

almost 4 days earlier of schedule;
2. a time lag exists between HVAC and interior

items can be applied with explicit visual inspection, for
example. to help counting and recording the number of
steel bars or to help confirming if a clean-up job is
undergoing or a surrounding hedge is installed. The
potential types of application are as follows.
1. Supervision diary record: as an auxiliary record for
traditional book-keeping record;
2. Construction coordination: the panoramic view
virtually enables a blind-spot-free supervision for a
fast and easier access from different orientations;
3. Construction review: an after-work examination of

6: Recommended applications
This study proposes the supervision system in three
categories:
I . a construction monitoring system: including system
structure and computer hardware and software;
2 . an application pattern: a real-time monitoring and
recording for explicit construction items;
3. exempli tication: an interior renovation site.
The panorama monitoring system is suitable for the

>

This research acts as a pilot stud? that tries to
increase the efticirnc? and etfecti\eness i n super\ ision.
Although an iniage-based VR recording s> stem has some
advantages ober traditional m e . a coniplete s>steni is !et
to be de\eloped. Its application also needs to be \eritied in
a larger site \\ith multiple sets o f t h c s\stetii.
