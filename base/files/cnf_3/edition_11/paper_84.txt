F = 250 MN, which corresponds to the red colour. The
horizontal movement of the force was also programmed
to have a left and right limit of motion, which covers
the length of the beam. The force in the model shown in
the figure 1 was designed to move from the left support
of the beam with co-ordinate x = 0 m, to the right
support of the beam with co-ordinate x = 10 m.

Abstract
Visualisation is generally considered to be a problem in
structural design. Being an iterative process, structural
design is time consumingJgr engineers, and results are
difficult for clients to visualize. Current numerical
methods have slow dynamic visualisation capability,
which is usually separate ,from the calculation phase.
This paper investigates whether an analogue virtual
reality (VR) model of (2 structure can integrate
calculation and visual representation. Early results of
this research show that it is possible to have analogue
virtual reality models of structures capable of real time
user interaction. The paper shows how the user can
interact with a VR analogue model of a simple beam,
move a concentrated load d o n g the length of the beam,
change the value of theforce, and visualise deflection of
the beam using the analytical solution of the problem.

Figure 1 The VR visual beam model of a
simple beam of length L = 10 m, height h = 1 m
depth d = I m , Youngâ€™s modulus E = 207 GN/m2:
second moment of area I = 0.0833333 m4, with
application of a vertical concentrated load of F =
250 MN at position of x = 6.506 m from left support
of the beam and with displayed values of
deflection for
each
cross-section between
segments

1: Virtual beam model
The geometry of the visual beam object was
defined as an element with a finite number of cross
sections. The force was presented as an arrow shape,
indicating the direction and orientation of the vector on
the screen. The VR visual beam model divided in I O
segments is shown in figure 1. The parameters adopted
for the model were based on the properties of steel. The
force was calibrated for a significant deflection of the
simple steel beam, thus making the visualisation easier.

The communication between the two objects, the
beam and the force, is based on exchange of inputs and
outputs between them. The displacement of cross
sections of the visual beam is based on the analytical
solution for the simple beam as a function of the
position of the force, obtained from the classical
solution in the field of Strength of Materials [I]. As the
value and the position of the force on the beam is sent
to the visual beam object, the displacement is calculated
and displayed accordingly.

Dragging the force downwards with the cursor
changes the value of the force proportionally to the
dragging distance, and within a range between a
minimum and a maximum value, displayed by the
arrow interactively. At the same time, the colour of the
arrow changes proportionally to the force, from blue for
zero, to red for the maximum value. For the model
shown in figure 1, the maximum value of the force is

3: Conclusions and future work
Although the scope of this model, dealing with
one geometry only, is extremely limited, the basis of
this approach, if expanded, would have a chance of
becoming a useful tool for sketch design analysis or for
educational purposes. The same model with different
analytical solution was successfully applied in
modelling a cantilever beam as reported in [5].

The calculation of displacement of each cross
section was programmed on the basis of analytical
solutions ( I ) and (2) from the classical approach [ l ] .
Consequcntly, dragging the arrow resulted in a
proportional interactive bending of the simple beam.
The dcflection of each cross section between segmcnts
was displayed on the screen interactively.

The authors will consider other analytical
solutions, and their replacement with shape functions
from the Finite Element Method, which will enable the
model to be more general and to represent other
structural systems such as portal frame. The future work
will also include bending moment and shear force
diagram as a part of the model.

2: Results
The corresponding image obtained from LUSAS
is shown in the figure 2. In the case of the VR visual
beam model of the simple beam, it is easy to go from
the case shown in figure 3 to the case shown in figure 1.
T6e user just needs to move the cursor to the right, from
the position that represents x = 3.001 m to position that
represents x = 6.506 m, and to keep the magnitude of
the force the same. Furthermore, if the user wants to
visualise different positions with different magnitude of
the force, he needs to adjust the position and intensity
of the force by dragging it horizontally and vertically,
as desired.

However, the same level of interactivity is not
possible in LUSAS [2]. There is no provision for
interactive adjustment of the load, and the user needs to
wait for the calculation to complete and for the image of
the deflected beam to be produced for each different
