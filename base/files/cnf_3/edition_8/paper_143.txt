Abstract
Today, more so than ever, patents play an important
role in helping inventors and organizations protect their
intellectual property. With a 140% increase in the
number of patents granted over the last 25 years, a rich
source of data is available that can be examined to better
understand changing trends in patent grants. In this
paper we discuss visualization techniques that allow us
to examine the classification of more than 2.5 million
patents in an attempt to improve understanding of how
an assignee’s patent portfolio, and the patent space as a
whole, is partitioned and evolves over time.

1. Introduction
Individuals and organizations rely on patents to
protect their intellectual property. As market competition
increases, there is a subsequent rise in pressure towards
patenting business methods and intellectual property.
Due to the increased number of patents being granted
(Figure 1), it has become important to create tools and
methodologies that better facilitate understanding of this
large corpus.

patents with scientific citations [6]. While differences
have been identified in patent citations, compared to
traditional journal-based citations [7]; the scientometric
methodology still provides a powerful set of tools for
analyzing patent data.
From a visualization perspective, there has been
work done in analyzing, modeling, and displaying
knowledge domains [8-10]; but this work has
traditionally focused on scientific data and metrics. For
visualizing patents, research typically has focused on a
subset of the data. For example, Morris discusses the use
of self-organizing maps to analyze a portfolio of patents
[11]; and Boyack uses VxInsight to map the dynamics of
patents related to magnetic information storage and
patents granted over a one month period [12].
Most patent analysis is done by consultants for
private clients, using proprietary software packages such
as, VxInsight (VisWave), ThemeScape (Micro-Patent),
and Anacubis IP Analysis (Anacubis) [13-15]. These
programs use textual analysis or citation mapping to
provide an overview of a subset of the patent space.
This paper goes beyond existing work by attempting
to map and visualize the whole classification structure of
the patent space and track its change over time.
The paper is organized as follows: A discussion of
the United States Patent Office (USPTO) classification
and patent structure will be given; examples and
visualizations of change in classification categories over
the last 25 years will be presented, and visualization
techniques will be used to compare the patent counts of
assignee’s portfolios in relation to their distribution
across classes. Finally, for a case study, we will look at
the specific patent portfolio of Apple Computer and
Lemelson Medical, Education & Research Foundation in
an attempt to identify the patent classification strategies
of specific assignees.

patents has focused on the use of scientometric methods

The source data for this study is the USPTO patent
archive containing all patent grants from January 1, 1976
to December 31, 2002. The data contains information on
what day the patent was granted, title, abstract, patent
number, author and coauthor, class and subclass under

which the patent was filed, and citation references of
each patent.
The USPTO currently has more than 450 classes
under which a patent can be categorized [16]. Classes
cover certain domains; for example, class 455
encompasses
all
patents
dealing
with
telecommunications. Classes are further broken down by
subclasses that have hierarchical associations. For
example, class 455 features subclass 99 entitled “with
vehicle.” This subclass is a child of subclass 95, “mobile
or portable” which itself is a child of the mainline
subclass 91, entitled “transmitter” [17].
A patent is comprised of several claims, which
describe the unique attributes of the artifact or method
that the inventor is patenting. Each claim is categorized
into a specific class/subclass, and for organization
purposes, the patent gets assigned a single class/subclass
(referred to as its Original Classification, OCL). For
example, a patent with an OCL code of 455/91 has been
classified in class 455, subclass 91: which means that the
patent has made a claim about a vehicle based mobile or
portable telecommunication transmitter.

class during the current interval in relation to the number
of patents filed in a previous interval. To better visualize
change over time, treemaps were placed in a time
sequence to better facilitate comparison.

In order to examine changes in patents and classes
over the last three decades, the data set was examined in
five year (inclusive) intervals from 1978-1982, 19831987, 1988-1992, 1993-1997, and 1998-2002. We
retrieved from our dataset the original classification of
all patents that were filed in each respective five year
interval. Descriptive statistics were gathered from this
data in order to identify and rank classes that have the
most activity and patents.
Our data was visualized using treemaps, which
presents a tree-based hierarchy as a collection of nested
rectangles, where the hierarchy, size and color of the
rectangles can be coded to represent certain attributes
[18]. For our use, size shows total number of patents in
each class, and color shows percentage increase (green)
or decrease (red) in the number of patents granted in a
class from the previous interval. Change was calculated
by comparing the number of patents filed in a specific

In order to develop a more understandable overview
of which classes are associated with certain domains,
higher level hierarchies are required. For this we used
the categories as implemented by Hall et. al. [19]. Their
paper places patent classes into six main hierarchies:
Group I - Chemical; Group II - Computers and
Communications; Group III - Drugs and Medical; Group
IV - Electrical and Electronic; Group V - Mechanical;
and Group VI - Others. These hierarchies are broken
down further into sub-categories. For example, Group II
(Computers and Communication) contains subcategories for Communications, Computer Hardware and
Software, Computer Peripherals, and Information
Storage. It is within these sub-hierarchies that specific
patent classes get categorized.
Scatter-plots were generated in order to examine the
number of patents filed versus the classes they were
assigned to. Data was obtained by calculating the total
number of patents granted to all assignees between 1978
and 2002, and by tracking the number of unique classes
under which these patents were categorized.
To examine the patent portfolio of specific
companies, all patents for Apple Computer and
Lemelson Medical were retrieved from our dataset, and
treemaps were generated to longitudinally compare and
display long term changes.

3. Data Analysis/Results
3.1 Class Changes
An examination of patent classes shows that
classification categories provide insight about the broad

domain focus of current patenting trends. Table 1 shows
the top 10 classes with the most number of patents issued
from 1978 to the end of 1982. This table shows that class
260 (Chemistry of Carbon Compounds) is the most
popular class, receiving 13544 patents between 1978 and
1982, and class titles indicate an emphasis toward the
mechanical (classes 29, 123, 73) and electrical domain
(classes 340,364).
Table 2 shows classification metrics 20 years later,
for the period of 1998 to the end of 2002. This table

shows a dramatic increase in the number of patents
granted. There are more then twice as many patents for
popular categories as opposed to 20 years ago, and in
2002, the focus is less on the traditional mechanical or
electrical domain and oriented more towards bio-medical
(classes 514, 435, 424) and information systems (classes
395, 345, 365).
Treemap visualizations of the whole patent space
offer further insight about the dataset. The advantage of

Figure 2. Treemap Visualizations of 83-87 and 98-02 Patent Space
using a treemap is that it allows one to examine and
compare three data attributes at once: the total number of
patents added to a class during an interval, the increase
or decrease of number of patents in a class from the
previous interval, and when combined with the highlevel categories, the ability to compare these trends
within certain domains and study its change over time.
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the patent class
space for 1983 to 1987 and 1998 to 2002. There is a
predominance of growth in the 1998 to 2002 patent
space, which correlates to the increase in patent grants
during this period. By comparing the growth in
categories one can distinguish between domains that
have been receiving a larger amount of patent grants.

For example, Electrical & Electronic, Computers and
Communications, and Drugs and Medical are all
categories that have more than doubled in size in the last
15 years. Mechanical, Chemical, and others (which
includes subcategories for Receptacles, Agriculture
Husbandry, and Apparel and Textile) are categories that
have grown at a slower pace.
One can also identify diverse dynamics taking place
within these broad domains. For example, the subcategory Semiconductor Devices (in the Electrical and
Electronic Domain) contains patents in two classes that
make up almost a quarter of the total grants in this
category. This sub-category is dominated by class 438
(Semiconductor Device Manufacturing: Process) and

3.2 Patent vs. Class
By examining the distribution of patents across
classes for an organization, one can get another view of
the patent space. Figure 3 shows a scatter-plot of the
total number of patents held by each assignee, for the
whole dataset, in relation to a count of the total number
of classes an assignees’ patents cover.

Figure 4 shows a close-up of the high-volume
periphery, made up of only 36 organizations. While
IBM may lead with total number of patents, the plot
shows that General Electric’s patent portfolio is more
diverse as opposed to that of Canon (this is expected, as
Canon’s business holdings are less diverse then that of
General Electric). Patent assignees in the high-volume
periphery share common organizational attributes,
namely the majority of them are fairly large, located in
Asia, and have a strong technology focus.

class 257 (Active Solid-State Devices (e.g., Transistors,
Solid-State Diodes) which, as table 2 shows, are the
second and sixth largest classes for 1998 to 2002. These
are also active classes that have doubled in size from the
previous interval.
Slower growth is identified in the sub-category of
Measuring and Testing (also within the category of
Electrical & Electronic). This sub-category is made up
predominantly of three class 73 (Measuring and Testing),
324 (Electricity: Measuring and Testing), and 356
(Optics: Measuring and Testing).
Growth here is
proceeding at a slower rate, expanding at a rate of 13%,
which is a drop from its 33% growth rate in 1983 to
1987.

This plot shows that in the last 25 years, the majority
of assignees, which make up the “patent core,” have
received less than 5000 patents distributed across fewer
than 100 classes. One also has a wide periphery, which
we refer to as the high volume periphery, made up of
assignees who have received 5000 or more patents

3.3 Examining an Assignee’s Portfolio
Examining the whole patent space enables one to get
a global perspective of changing trends in patent grants,
and scatter-plots of an organizations’ patent count versus
class count offers further insight into the relation

between patents and classes. One can also use treemaps
to view a specific assignee’s portfolio in an attempt to
get insight into an organizations business and research
focus. For example, Figure 6 uses treemaps to show how
Apple Computer’s portfolio has evolved in yearly
increments from 1980 to 2002.

Figure 6. Apple Computer’s Patent Portfolio 1980-2002

Figure 7. Jerome Lemelson’s Patent Portfolio 1976-2002
By placing the treemaps next to each other on a
timeline, one is better able to identify change in the
number of patents granted. In the case of Apple
Computer, one can easily make out a decrease after
1998. If one were to attempt to visualize the whole
patent space in a single treemap, it would require more
effort to identify progression, as the default algorithm
would sort based on a patent portfolio size, and not by
year.
Classes that are shown in shades of yellow signify
that in the previous one to five years the assignee had not
been granted patents in that specific class. In this
example, the treemap illustrates that in most years, more
than half of Apple Computer’s patents were placed into
four classes, namely 395 (Information Processing System
Organization), 345 (Computer Graphics Processing,
Operator Interface Processing, and Selective Visual
Display Systems), 382 (Image Analysis), and 707 (Data
Processing: Database and File Management or Data

Structures.) These four classes are an integral part of
Apple Computer’s patent portfolio, receiving patents
during a majority of the years. Lack of continuity is
mainly identified in the smaller classes.
A treemap visualization of an assignee whose patent
distributions are more diluted over multiple classes
would differ from the above example. An example of
this would be the patent holdings of Jerome Lemelson, a
prolific inventor considered by admirers a genius of the
same stature as Thomas Edison and by critics as
someone who took advantage of the patent system [20].
A treemap of Lemelson’s patent holdings (Figure 7)
shows a more even distribution of patents over multiple
classes. No class dominates over a majority of the years
for granted patents. This illustrates that patents assigned
to Lemelson, while fewer in number than Apple
Computer, are distributed more broadly over the
intellectual space, as opposed to Apple Computer, whose
patent portfolio is dominated by four classes. The

Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV’04)
1093-9547/04 $ 20.00 IEEE

predominance of yellow also shows that there is not
much continuity from previous years in regards to which
classes patents get filed. During any given year, it would
be more likely for Lemelson to be granted a patent in a
class in which he did not receive any patents the previous
year.

4. Conclusion
This paper presents a first attempt to map the
landscape of United States patent classes on a large
scale. The results provide a global view of the structure
and dynamics of the patent classification space over the
last 25 years. The original treemap visualization was
modified to show the evolution of an assignee’s patent
portfolio, and with the whole patent dataset, display
which classes patents are issued to over a period of time.
When looking at a specific portfolio of an assignee,
and examining how patent-class distributions change
over time, one can attempt to identify past domains of
interest. Visualizations facilitate awareness: one can
identify if a patent collection is swiftly growing, building
on past work, or focused on a specific area. We hope
that the presented approaches and visualizations lead to a
better understanding and ultimately management of
patent data.
Our future work will focus on the identification of
fast growing areas that receive numerous patent
applications and patent issues over short time spans and
the prediction of patent portfolio growth rates for
specific companies and/or classification areas. Ideally,
we will be able to correlate those trends with growth
indicators derived from other data sources such as
publications, grants and/or financial data.
