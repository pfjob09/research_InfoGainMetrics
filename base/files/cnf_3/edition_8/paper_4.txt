Abstract
Options are amongst the most heavily transacted
financial instruments in the world. This paper examines
how the methods of visual exploratory tools, espoused by
Cleveland[1] can be used to analyze the residuals from
conventional option pricing models [2, 3]. Until recently,
these models were believed to be unbiased [4, 5]. With the
aid of visual exploratory tools we see that options on the
All Ordinaries share price index trading on the Sydney
Futures exchange have persistent, systematic and
significant bias. This is the first time that various
statistically oriented visual exploratory tools have been
used to analyze option residuals. We find that the analysis
motivates the use of alternative option pricing methods
.

We complete an absolute analysis of the option
pricing residuals. Such an evaluation provides an absolute
benchmark by which to judge a model; it is very stringent.
To pass an absolute evaluation, there must be no structure
in the model residuals. Residual structure is tested from a
number of perspectives: bias, interaction, homogeneity
and dependence. If any of these perspectives reveal
residual structure then the conventional option pricing
model will not pass the test. This implies that the model is
imperfect. In principle, improvement is possible.
An absolute evaluation is conducted from each
perspective using data visualization analysis on the
residuals. The data visualization approach is sensitive to
all possible defects in the functional form of a model.
Thus, the data visualization technique is superior to the
traditional single number summary ([8], p.278).
As [1] states:

1. Introduction
For the past decade a debate has raged about the
accuracy of conventional option pricing models. Since
their discovery, these models have become amongst the
most accurate in the social sciences, winning the Nobel
prize in 1997. However, since the 1987 stock market
crash a pronounced bias has appeared in the models. Today, option traders commonly adjust the models in an adhoc manner. Many modern conventional models,
designed to generalize the assumptions of the
conventional models have been created â€“ none appear to
work well, consistently out-of-sample [6, 7].
Surprisingly, little, if any, work has been completed
using the many plots of statistical exploratory data
visualization [1] on the analysis of the bias of
conventional option pricing models as a first step in the
data modeling process. Typically, either none, or only a
cursory and simple exploratory data analysis is
completed.
In our view, this is more than a shame. As we shall
see, visual exploratory data analysis can provide insight
into the deficiencies of an option pricing model and also
provide the required properties that models must have to
be accurate, out-of-sample.
This lack of visual exploratory data analysis in the
option pricing context is rectified in this work where we
apply such an analysis to options on futures that trade on
the Australian All Ordinaries share price index.

Many techniques of data analysis have data reduction
as their first step..... Using only numerical reduction
methods in data analysis is far too limiting. We
cannot expect a small number of numerical values to
consistently convey the wealth of information that
exists in data. Numerical reduction methods do not
retain the information in the data. ... there can be
surprises in the data.
As we shall see our exploratory data analysis will
reveal such â€˜surprisesâ€™: many of which have hitherto been
ignored in the literature.
The following work is divided into four parts, each
analyzing the residuals from the most accurate
conventional option pricing model: firstly, we consider
the residual bias as a function of the model input
variables; then, the interaction between residuals and
option input variables; and finally, we consider residual
homogeneity.

2. Residual Bias
For the AO SPI options on futures, the optimal
conventional option pricing model (OPM) has been
showed in previous work to be the, Sydney Futures
Exchange (SFE) accepted, modified Black option pricing
model [3, 9, 10] . It can be expressed as:

(0.1)of the â€˜at-the-moneyâ€™ options is
near zero. The median of the deep-in-the-money options
is below zero (i.e. the optimal conventional model underprices deep out-of-the-money options). The pattern is
non-linear. This result is consistent with other work on the
same data set ([11, 12]).

From Figure 2 we can see that there is some
interaction between these two option input parameters and
residual bias. The symmetry we noted with the box plot as
a function of moneyness is still visible. However, we can
clearly see that the residual error becomes larger as the
time to maturity is larger.
We have examined the residuals grouped into intervals
for each of the option pricing input variables. Strong
systematic, persistent, statistically significant and
economically significant option pricing biases can be
shown to occur as a function of the moneyness, maturity
and WISD option pricing input variables.

plots are graphical tools used to determine if the residuals
can be characterized as additive.
The conditioning plot or co-plot is a powerful
visualization tool for studying interaction (i.e. how a
response depends on two or more factors), as is shown in
Figure 3. A co-plot has seven-by-seven dependence panels,
each of which contains a loess curve1. The loess curve
shows how the residuals (i.e. the dependent variable) vary
as a function of moneyness (F/X; i.e. the independent
variable) for a given interval of maturity and WISD. The
ideal curve, if the model were to have no bias, would be a
straight horizontal line at zero.
The lowest row corresponds to the lowest WISD
(<12.5%), the highest row corresponds to the highest
WISD (>25%). The left column corresponds to the shortest
maturity (<0.05 years), the right-most column to the
longest maturity (>0.3 years) (see Table 1).
We note changes in the loess curve shape as we move
from panel to panel. If there is a change in shape (not a
simple translation), we can deduce that there exists
interaction between maturity and WISD. A change in
shape, as we move between panels, indicates interaction
because the value of the dependent value (i.e. F/X) is a
function of the value of the fixed independent variables
(i.e. T-t in the x-direction and WISD in the y-direction).

A model that passes the absolute evaluation must be
correctly specified. In the previous section we considered
bias, which is the most overt source of model misspecification. There is, however, a more subtle source of
model mis-specification: non-additivity. Model residuals
may have no bias, but may be non-additive and therefore
mis-specified.
For a model to be additive, if we fix each independent
variable except one, the change in the response Y is the
same regardless of the values at which the independent
variables are fixed. In a non-additive model, at least two
variables interact in influencing the dependent variable
which means that the value of the dependent variable will
be a function of the value of both the non-fixed
independent variable and of the fixed independent
variables: for example, a non-additive model is shown by
the equation y=Dx1+Ex2+Jx1x2. The third term is an
interaction term between the independent variables x1 and
x2.
If the model residuals are non-additive it implies that it
is mis-specified because model input variable interaction is
not modeled correctly. Non-additivity is made manifest in
the option pricing residuals through interaction. Input
interaction is studied in this section using co-plots. Co-

low WISD) shows a horizontal loess curve. Thus we can
conclude that interaction between T-t and WISD conspires
to change the loess curve of residuals against moneyness.
An additive model such as a simple OLS linear regression
would not be appropriate.
It is possible to detect general trends in interaction.
The first general trend in the data is that the ideal
horizontal loess curve centered at zero, occurs
infrequently3. The loess curves that are a function of WISD
have the smallest magnitude. The other input parameters
show a substantial bias in the optimal conventional model.
There are three general shapes for short, medium and
longest maturity. The shortest maturity shape is a short
horizontal line (i.e. no bias). The medium maturity loess
curve is an inverse â€˜Lâ€™, while the longest maturity is a
straight line with a negative gradient (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 The interaction between the residuals
and maturity for the moneyness loess curve.
The interpretation of the moneyness loess curves
provides new insights into the moneyness bias. There is a
very small moneyness bias for the shortest maturity options
due to residual clustering around at-the-money options
(because there tends to be little bias for the at-the-money
options). There is a strong in/out-of-the-money effect for
the medium and the longest maturity options. The market
will pay an extra premium for options that are in-themoney and will pay less for options that are out-of-themoney. There is a kink around unity moneyness for
medium maturity options. The in-the-money overpricing is
capped (i.e. the same) for all the medium maturity/in-themoney options. The in/out-of-the-money effect follows a
simple linear relationship for longest maturity options.
These interaction effects are subtle. Some have been
mentioned in the literature, which does, for example,
mention the strong in/out-of-the-money effect ([13]).
However, it does not mention the capped overpricing effect
for medium maturity in-the-money options, nor does it
mention the very-small-moneyness effect for shortest
maturity options. Presumably, these moneyness interaction
effects are omitted because they are data set-specific or
they are subtle, and the conventional OPM literature does
not utilize data visualization techniques such as co-plots.
As we move in the vertical direction, from lowest to
highest WISD, there is another subtle interaction: the
relationship between the residuals and moneyness changes

The scale for the residuals in the co-plots extends from â€“

translates into a bias of 8 points or $25*8=$200 per option.

from concave to convex. For the low WISD curve, the inthe-money options have the same minimum bias. For the
high WISD moneyness curve the out-of-the-money options
have the same maximum bias.

Figure 5 As WISD changes from small (bottom) to
large (top) the moneyness loess curve changes
from concave to convex.
To conclude, the co-plots show clearly that interaction
exists between input variables and the residuals of the
optimal conventional model â€“â€“ the MB. The existence of
interaction means that the optimal conventional model is
mis-specified. A correctly specified model would show no
residual interaction.

4. Residual Homogeneity
In this section, we conduct the absolute evaluation
from a third perspective. Another form of model misspecification is tested: residual homogeneity. If, after
fitting a model, the process of finding a homogeneous
model residual distribution lies at the core of the statistical
approach of model fitting, then testing for that
homogeneity is a very important step. This step is taken in
this section.
The visual technique used to test for residual
homogeneity is the quantileâ€“quantile plot (qqplot). The
goal of comparing distributions is to understand how they
change from one data set (i.e. interval) to another. Using
qqplots, two distributions are compared by graphing
quantiles of one distribution against quantiles of another
[13]). If we find persistent and systematic changes in the
residual distributions, we argue that the distributions are
not homogeneous, but change for reasons associated with
model mis-specification.
Testing for residual homogeneity is important because
residual pooling cannot be correctly applied without
residual homogeneity. Residual pooling permits the
variation in the entire set of residuals to describe the
variation of any data point (or data sub-set, such as a
maturity interval). This is especially useful if an interval is
sparse (i.e. has few data points). However, if a structure is
applied to create homogeneous residuals, the resulting
description is valid if and only if the structure is valid. This
has ramifications for the any residual re-sampling
procedures to be undertaken, for example, to estimate
standard error.

represent shortest maturity options: we wouldnâ€™t expect
way-in- or way-out-of-the-money transactions for these
shortest maturity options because there is a very small
probability of change in option value. So the short tails in
the qqplots are due to the at-the-money clustering evident
in the corresponding co-plots.
Panel (3,4) shows an asymmetric distribution: the
lower tail is shorter. If we compare the qqplot panel to the
co-plot panel (3,4) (Figure 3), we see that there are in fact
very few residuals less than zero. This behaviour is
applicable to short-to-medium maturity options with high
WISD. High-WISD options with longer maturity (i.e.
qqplot and co-plot panels (5,4)) do not show this
behaviour. From both the qqplot and the co-plot the
optimal conventional OPM overprices shortâ€“medium
maturity/ high-WISD options.
Finally, longer upper tails are evident in the qqplot
panels (5,3) and (6,3). These longer tails are consistent
with very large positive loess curves shown in the
corresponding co-plots (the negative loess curves are
approximately the same size as many other panels). Longer
maturity/ medium-WISD options tend to be more
overpriced than other options.
Figures which are analogous to Figure 6 but permutate
the variables (i.e. Tt(F/X,WISD) and WISD(F/X,WISD))
are omitted for the sake of brevity. However, we comment
on some general trends discovered from their analysis. The
first general trend we wish to consider is the additive effect
for maturity. If we compare the left-hand/small moneyness
qqplots with the right-hand/large moneyness qqplots we
can see that the residuals change from being above the red
line to below. This effect is persistent. This observation is
consistent with the influence that moneyness has on
maturity noted above (Figure 4). It is another way of
stating that the out-of-the-money-options tend to be
overpriced by the MB while the deep-in the-money-options
tend to be underpriced.

Residual

Suppose we have two sets of univariate measurements
to compare: we order the points in each data set from
smallest to largest: x1, â€¦xn for the first data set, and y1, â€¦
,ym for the second data set. If m=n then xi and yi are both
(i-0.5)/n quantiles of their respective data sets. On the
qqplot yi would be graphed against xi. In other words, we
plot the ith smallest data point from the Y data set against
the ith smallest data point from the X data set ([1]).
If the two distribution quantiles were similar, the
qqplot would vary around the straight line yi=xi. If the
distributions differ by a change in the mean of u, this is
known as an â€˜additiveâ€™ shift and can be expressed as:
yi=xi+u. It is also possible for the two distributions to go
through the origin but have different gradients yi=mxi. This
shift is â€˜multiplicativeâ€™ which is more complicated than the
additive shift because it can result in differences between
both the locations and the spread of the distributions.
In this way we compare each subset of residuals with
the overall residual set. In Figure 6 there are seven by
seven dependence panels, each containing a qqplot. In each
qqplot, the Xi data set is the entire set of residuals. The Yi
data set is a subset of the residuals that vary over different
intervals of maturity and WISD. The panels in Figure 6
correspond to the co-plot panels in Figure 3. Each
dependence panel shows a different interval of maturity (in
the x-direction) and WISD (in the y-direction). The
division into seven panels corresponds to the seven input
parameter categories (provided in Table 1). The lowest
row corresponds to the lowest WISD (<12.5%), the highest
row to the highest WISD (>25%). The left column
corresponds to the shortest maturity (<0.05 years), the
right-most column to the longest maturity (>0.3 years).
For each panel the ideal curve is a straight line where
Yi=Xi. This indicates that the residuals have a similar
distribution regardless of maturity or WISD. On the other
hand, deviations from this straight line would indicate
residual non-homogeneity. We note deviations from the
straight line as we scan between panels. For example, in
Figure 6 we can see if maturity and WISD interact to
change the shape of the qqplot. If there is a systematic and
persistent change in shape, as WISD and maturity vary, we
can deduce that there exists some real effect causing nonhomogeneity in the residual data set.
We can relate the qqplots of Figure 6 to the
corresponding co-plots (i.e. interaction plots) of Figure 3.
In this way we can augment the analysis of the qqplot
panel with the co-plot panel and have a better
understanding of the residual behaviour.
There is evidence of shorter tails in panels (1,2) and
(1,3) of the qqplots of Figure 6. We can understand the
shorter tails if we consider the corresponding panels in the
co-plots (Figure 3). The loess curves in both (1,2) and (1,3)
of the co-plots are very short and do vary over the range.
Small loess curves are found in these panels because most
of the data points are clustered around at-the-money
options. This clustering occurs because these panels

A similar trend occurs for the WISD panels. As we
move from small to large moneyness (i.e. in the y
direction) we find that the residuals change from above to
below the red line. The interaction relies on both maturity
and moneyness because the effect is most pronounced for
the longest maturity options. Furthermore, for shorter
maturity options, the residual distribution is skewed, with
the lower tail shorter than the upper tail. As the moneyness
increases, for the shorter maturity options the short lower
tail becomes progressively longer.
These observations are very exciting. Although
discovered independently, they are consistent with [14]â€™s
observation:
Perhaps the most striking thing I found was that
volatilities [standard deviations] go up as stock
prices fall and do down as stock prices rise.
He attributes these changes to leverage effects for
firms.
The final trend is one where the maturity varies on the
x-axis (such as Figure 6). For very short maturity options
(i.e. those panels on the left-hand side of the co-plot), the
tails of the distribution of the MB OPM residuals tend to be
shorter. This is because for shortest and very short maturity
options, most transactions cluster around at-the-money
options and therefore the errors tend to be less variable (i.e
the tails are shorter).
To conclude, the residuals are not homogeneous.
Those residuals that contain systematic patterns imply that
the model is mis-specified. Also, non-homogeneity implies
that residual pooling cannot be used.

the optimal conventional option pricing model provides to
the transaction data using data visualization techniques. It
was found that systematic, persistent and significant option
pricing biases exist in the optimal conventional model
residuals. There are subtle non-linear relationships between
the input variables and the residuals. It was found that there
are small input-variable interaction effects.
These findings are extremely important: they imply
that the optimal conventional option pricing approach can
be improved and provide the impetus for new option
pricing models. Furthermore, they have proven the utility
of data visualization tools in the option pricing context â€“ a
first as far as we know.
