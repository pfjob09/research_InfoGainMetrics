Abstract
Research fronts are the forefront of a scientific field.
Timely identifying emerging trends and abrupt changes in
scientific literature is not only beneficial for users of
digital libraries, but also instrumental for users to trace
the movement of a research front. A research front can be
seen as a dynamic and transient mapping from the state
of the art to its immediate prior art - the intellectual base.
Citation and co-citation analysis primarily focuses on the
structure and dynamics of the intellectual base,
information retrieval and related research mainly focuses
on intrinsic properties of text documents. In this article,
we describe a novel approach that enables us to detect
and visualize the transient relationship over time.
Temporal associations between content words connected
to a surge of interest in scientific papers and high-impact
articles in the intellectual base are identified and
visualized as a time-variant network. We apply the
approach to the detection of thematic changes over time
in information visualization and research in terrorism.

Introduction

A research front in a scientific field represents the
state of the art of the collective knowledge of a scientific
community [1]. A fundamental way for a research front to
link to its immediate prior art – the intellectual base - is
via citations in scientific publications, i.e. via references
made by scientists in their papers. Timely identifying
emerging trends and abrupt changes associated with a
research front is not only beneficial for users of digital
libraries, but also instrumental for users to trace the
movement of a research front and better utilize resources
and services provided in digital libraries.
Relevant research falls into two broad categories: the
study of the intellectual base, and the study of text
documents. The most representative work of the former is

citation and co-citation analysis, which typically focuses
on the extent to which scientific publications have
influenced subsequent publications in terms of citation
impact. The most representative work in the latter is
research in information retrieval, especially including a
variety of theories and techniques developed for detecting
thematic trends in text documents. However, few studies
have quantitatively investigated the interconnection
between the contents of the most recent scientific
publications and the intellectual base. To our knowledge,
citing documents and cited documents have not been
studied and represented in a coherent and unifying
framework.
Studying the relationship has several practical
implications. One of the limitations of citation-based
methods is the delay caused by the very nature of citation
data; citing articles must go through peer review and
publication processes before citations made in these
articles become countable. Citation data alone cannot tell
us anything more recent than when they are produced.
The latest trends are more likely to be detected by
studying recent text documents. On the other hand,
citations provide valuable information on how the
scientific community as a whole reacts to particular
publications, and such acceptance takes time. Such
information is beyond the reach of statistical models of
intrinsic properties of text documents. In other words, a
high frequency term may be associated with a surge of
interest, but it is not necessarily a good predictor of a
subsequent popularity by peer scientists. In this article, we
describe a novel approach that enables us to detect and
visualize the transient relationship between newly
published scientific papers and their intellectual base.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. We first
introduce related work, including co-citation analysis,
content word analysis, detecting abrupt changes and
emerging trends, and visualizing changes over time. Then
we explain our approach in detail and demonstrate the use
of this approach in detecting and visualizing changes in
research on information visualization and on terrorism.

Related work

Quantitative approaches to the study of science have
been mainly developed by the scientometrics community,
including pioneer works such as [1-7]. The major problem
now is the lack of information and knowledge
management techniques that enable scientists and a
variety of digital library users to detect and track
significant changes over time as part of the big picture of
science.

2.1.

Co-citation analysis and word analysis

Derek Price [1] suggested that scientific literature
contains two distinct parts: a classic part and a transient
part. The make-up of these two parts varies from field to
field; mathematics, for example, is strongly predominated
by the classic part, whereas the transient literature rules in
physics. Furthermore, he introduced the notion of
research fronts – the transient part of scientific literature as a collection of papers that have draw much of the
attention of scientists. Based on an examination of
citation patterns of scientific papers, he conjectured that it
is possible to identify objectively defined subjects in
citation networks. He particularly emphasized the
significance of understanding the nature of such moving
frontiers in the development of a quantitative method for
delineating the topography of current scientific literature.
In this article, we consider research fronts as a transient
mapping between the most salient themes in the latest
publications and highly cited publications corresponding
to such themes.
Research has shown that clusters of highly co-cited
articles can reveal the extent a field of study shifts its
focus [5, 8, 9]. Small and Griffith examined issues
concerned with identifying specialties by mapping the
structure of scientific literatures, especially through
analyses of co-citation networks [10]. Small subsequently
found rapid changes of focus in collagen research [5].
Besides co-citation analysis, co-word analysis is a
method initially developed in 1960s [11]. Co-word
analysis frequently uses the so-called inclusion index,
which measures the extent to which the appearance of one
word in a text document predicts the appearance of
another. However, few techniques are available for
conducting co-citation analysis and content word analysis
in a coherent and integrative framework.
The most notably exception of the lack of combined
approaches to co-citation analysis and content word
analysis is the study conducted more than a decade ago by
Braam, Moed, and van Raan [3]. They studied the
literature of atomic and molecular physics over a period
of 10 years by combining co-citation analysis and content
word analysis. However, more precisely, they combined
the results of co-citation analysis and content word

analysis. Content words were extracted from articles
citing papers in co-citation clusters.
The focus of their study was on co-citation clusters
rather than co-citation networks of documents per se.
Indeed, their assumption is that content words reflect
specialties more directly than co-citation clusters;
therefore, they evaluated the comprehensiveness of
specialties as represented by co-citation clusters by
examining the congruence between the results of the two
methods, i.e. the extent to which they converge.
In summary, there is the lack of techniques that enable
users to handle the transient and volatile nature of
scientific frontiers. Word analysis can reveal significant
trends and abrupt changes in the latest publications, but it
must make a connection between such properties and
articles identified by co-citation analysis.

2.2.

Detecting abrupt thematic changes

Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) projects aim to
develop and evaluate technologies required to segment,
detect, and track topical information in a stream
consisting of news stories. TDT addresses five types of
tasks: 1) story segmentation, 2) topic detection, 3) topic
tracking, 4) first story detection, and 5) story link
detection. Topic detection focuses on discovering
previously unseen topics, whereas topic tracking focuses
on monitoring stories known to a TDT system. Roy,
Gevry, and Pottenger [12] presented methodologies for
trend detection. Kontostathis, Galitsky, Pottenger, Roy,
and Phelps [13] gave a comprehensive survey of
emerging trend detection in textual data mining.
Allan, Papka, and Lavrenko [14] presented a single
pass clustering algorithm, in which the entire content of
each story is represented as a query. A newly arrived
story is compared with all the existing stories. If the new
story is similar enough to one of the existing ones, then to
the algorithm, it is really nothing new. In contrast, if no
match was found between the new story and existing
stories, then the newly arrived story is marked as
something completely new. It was reported that the single
pass algorithm can distinguish the Oklahoma City
Bombing stories from the earlier stories on the Word
Trade Center bombing. However, their algorithm could
not distinguish OJ Simpson trial stories from other court
cases.
Swan and Allan [15] constructed a statistical model
that can detect the arrival of significant information. The
key to their approach is to use a Ȥ2 distribution to identify
the probability of a single random word passing the Ȥ2 test
and thereby to determine whether the appearance of a
feature is purely by chance or not. Their approach was
tested with a subset of the Topic Detection and Tracking
(TDT) pilot study’s corpus, which contains CNN
broadcast news and Reuters newswires.

2.3.

Burst Detection

An interesting observation of news stories is that
events are often reported in burst. Yang, Pierce, and
Carbonell [16] depicted a daily histogram of story counts
over time. News stories about the same event tend to
appear within a very narrow timeframe. The gap between
two bursts can be used to discriminate distinct events.
More recently, Jon Kleinberg developed a burst detection
algorithm and applied to the arrivals of email and words
used in titles of articles [17].
Kleinberg’s method is based on the assumption that
whenever an important event occurs or is about to occur,
there should be a sharp increase of certain words that
characterize the event. He called such sharp increases
bursts. Essentially, Kleinberg’s burst detection algorithm
analyzes the rate of increase of word frequencies and
identifies the most rapidly growing words. He tested his
algorithm on the full text of all the State of the Union
addresses since 1790. The burst detection algorithm
identified important events occurring at the time of some
of the speeches. For example, depression and recovery
were bursty words in 1930-1937, fighting and Japanese
were bursty in 1942-1945, and atomic was the buzz word
in 1947 and 1959.
The major advantage of Kleinberg’s approach is that it
can handle multiple levels of bursts. There are alternative
approaches, such as wavelet analysis, Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) [18], and machine-learning and other
data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms. Data
mining and knowledge algorithms provide a rich source
of resources that can be used to enhance information
visualization. Algorithms that can detect abrupt changes
with the least number of false alarms are certainly useful
to filter out noises from the original data so that
subsequent modeling and visualization can produce much
improved and sharp focused information visualization.

2.4.

Visualizing Changes

ThemeRiver [19] is a visualization system that uses the
metaphor of a river to depict thematic flows over time in a
collection of documents. The thematic changes are shown
along a time line of corresponding external events. A
thematic river consists of frequency streams of terms; the
changing width of a stream over time indicates the
changes of term occurrences. The occurrence of an
external event may be followed by sudden changes of
thematic strengths. On the one hand, searching for an
abruptly widened thematic stream is a much more
intuitive task to detect a new story than text-based TDT
systems that can only report changes in terms of statistics.
On the other hand, ThemeRiver does not incorporate
additional data filters that would make changes in
thematic patterns easy to detect.

Powerful data modeling techniques can make salient
patterns clearer and in sharper contrast. Some of the major
technical problems are how to make the changes over
time easy to understand and how to preserve the overall
context in which changes take place.
Web ecology is concerned with relationships among
users and their information environment, and its
evaluation over time in terms of the content, the
topological properties, and the usage [20]. Disk Tree
represents the hyperlink structure of a website. It uses
breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to extract a tree
structure from the original network, and then visualizes
the tree structure. Time Tube shows an array of disk trees
to show the evolution of a website. They are designed to
support tasks such as comparison and trend detection.
Brandes and Corman [21] used semi-transparent layers
one on another to display the progress of a discourse.
Erten, Harding, Kobourov, Wampler, and Yee [22]
reported an interesting example of temporal graph
visualization of the categorization of papers in ACM
conference proceedings. The category graph for a given
time period is an undirected graph. Vertices represent
categories and edges represent categories that co-occurred
in these conference papers. The weight of a node
represents the concentration of research on a category.
The weight of an edge represents the strength of the
relation between two categories.
Chen and Morris [23] demonstrated an animated
visualization technique that can display the process of
network evolution. A Pathfinder network version and a
minimum spanning tree (MST) version were compared in
a study of co-citation networks over a time span of nearly
60 years. Although the MST version contained many
hubs, the animation revealed that the Pathfinder version
maintained the local accuracy of network evolution in a
much better way. Animated visualization techniques were
also used to depict how citation landscapes change over
time [24].
More recently, we reported the CITESPACE system for
co-citation analysis and visualization [25]. It was
designed to detect intellectual turning points in scientific
literature, especially to help users to identify articles that
triggered conceptual revolutions. CITESPACE supports a
number of analyzing and visualizing methods, namely
time slicing, thresholding, modeling, pruning, merging,
and mapping.
However, existing visualization methods are still
inadequate to help users to identify significant changes.
For example, how many citations to a scientific
publication in a year should count as a significant
increase? Straightforward counting cannot take us very
far. Visualizations based on ambiguous information
cannot give sharp and clear-cut images. Furthermore, to
what extent can we compensate the citation latency by
indicators that could be detected earlier, for example, a

1093-9547/04 $ 20.00 IEEE

surge of interest detected based on the abstracts of freshly
published articles?
In this article, we describe a novel method that
combines co-citation analysis and text analysis of content
words. We build upon the co-citation network
visualization techniques developed in CITESPACE and
establish a generic framework so that heterogeneous
aspects of scientific publications can be accommodated in
harmony (See Figure 1). The method is also extensible to
incorporate additional components from scientific
publications such as authors and authors' academic
affiliations as well as their geographic locations.

Figure 1 Our approach enables a unification of
various quantitative methods for studying
scientific literature.

3.

Method

The procedure of our approach consists of the
following steps. First, choose a topic of interest. In this
article, we demonstrate two examples: one on information
visualization and the other on terrorism or terrorist.
Second, compile datasets of bibliographic records of
scientific papers that match the chosen topic. In particular,
each record contains the title, the abstract, information on
authors, keywords provided by authors as well as
keywords provided by indexers, and a list of references.
The two illustrative examples are based on science
citation data compiled by ISI's Science Citation Index
(SCI).
The next step is to select only those content words that
have shown a surge of usage during the time interval of
the retrieved data. Both our examples in this article range
from 1990 through January 2004. Content words can be
selected from titles, abstracts, and keyword fields such as
descriptors and identifiers. Our experience suggests title
words and abstract words together tend to provide more
meaningful results than any other options. For example,
title words alone or descriptors alone do not always lead
to additional insights in resultant maps because of the
relatively lower prevalence of such words.

Content words of selected types are passed through
abrupt change detection algorithms. The goal is to
identify a subset of words that have demonstrated a
sufficient surge of popularity. After the September 11
terrorist attacks, one of the abruptly increased words in
scientific papers on terrorism is the abbreviation of PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In this study, we used
Kleinber's burst detection algorithm to detect the surge of
a word in citing articles. The algorithm also identifies the
span of a burst. Headline news may last days or weeks,
whereas a scientific topic may last years and even
decades.
The set of burst words and a subset of sufficiently cited
articles from the original dateset are used to form a series
of heterogeneous matrices. These matrices are
subsequently visualized as networks and synthesized as
an overall visualization. The selection of cited articles
essentially follows the same procedure as described in
[25]. The entire time interval can be divided into several
equal-length time slices. Within each sliced sub-interval,
one can specify a citation threshold that an article must
meet in order to be included in subsequent analysis;
similarly, one can specify a co-citation threshold that an
article must be co-cited with other articles frequently
enough to be included in the picture. If the frequency of a
word bursts during the interval of a time slice, i.e. if there
is an overlap between the burst span and the time slice
interval, then the word will become part of the matrix
corresponding to the time slice; otherwise, the word will
be excluded. Thus, each time slice is represented by
words that have abrupt increases in terms of their
frequencies within the same period of time.
Given a time slice, the corresponding matrix consists
of citing words and cited articles. The word-word
associations in such matrices are determined by cooccurrences of a pair of words in a citing document, for
example, in the title and the abstract. The article-article
associations are defined by co-citations. The word-article
connections indicate that the word is found in articles
citing the target article and that there is a surge of the use
of this particular word within the time span of the
analysis.
Each matrix defines a network with citing words and
cited articles as nodes. Excessive and redundant links in
such networks are pruned by Pathfinder network scaling
algorithm, also explained in [25]. Briefly speaking,
Pathfinder network scaling imposes a triangle inequality
condition over a network. It verifies if a link satisfies this
condition and removes links that violate the condition.

Results

Two examples are included in this article. The first
example is on information visualization (1990-2003) and
the second example is on terrorism/terrorist (1990-2004).

Example A: Information Visualization

The Information Visualization dataset contains 193
citing articles published between 1990 and 2004 on the
topic. We only removed a dozen of the most common
stopwords such as the, an, how, and where. We expected
that abrupt change detection would further eliminate most
stopwords if not all. As a result, among 3,777 content
words from titles, abstracts, descriptors, and identifiers of
the 193 articles, 654 words are retained because of
detected bursts. Abstract words turn out to be significant.
Removing other types of words hardly made any
difference in terms of the burst words. The merged
network contains 62 nodes. Thresholds for co-citation
analysis are shown in Table 1.

Figure 2 shows a synthesized network over seven time
slices between 1991 and 2004. Citing words are displayed
in red. The size of a word is proportional to its frequency
in the first year of its burst span. The color of a link
indicates the first year that the strength of the link exceeds
corresponding thresholds. The thickness of a link is
proportional to the strength of the link. The thicker a link
is shown, the stronger the co-citation association is. Cited
articles are labeled in dark, showing the author's name,
the year of publication, volume numbers and page
numbers. If it is a book, it is shown with a VBOOK in its
label. The font size of an article label is also proportional
to its citations. Larger sized labels mean more frequently
cited articles. The number at the lower left corner of a
label is the citation count when the article passed the
thresholds for the first time.
Blue links are links appearing in the earliest time slice,
whereas red links are links that didn't appear until the last
time slice. The earliest links in the Information
Visualization map are in purple in the lower right corner,
corresponding to the slice of 1993 and 1994. Links added
in the next slice (1995-1996) are further down in green.
Links emerged between 1997 and 1998 form a dense pink
cluster to the left, including the 1993 article by Robertson
and his colleagues on 3D interactive visualization. Several
citing words surged during this period, including graph

(found in 30 articles that cited Robertson 1993 paper),
multimedia (30), drawing (30), and search (30).
Additions in the following slice (1999-2000) form the
brown cluster in the center of the image, containing graph
drawing articles by Tamassia (1987), Dibattista (1994),
and Hendley (1995). Note that these are the first authors
only as they are shown in SCI's format. The high-profile
citing words in this cluster include patterns in 39 articles,
project (36), and drawings (36). The bright yellow cluster
centered by knowledge corresponds to the period of 2001
and 2002. The word knowledge appeared in 61 articles
within this short period. Other words such as multivariate
(33), life (29) and cycle (29) are also prominent in this
cluster. The few red links were added during the latest
time slice between 2003 and 2004.
Figure 3 shows a pruned version of the network shown
in Figure 2. Pathfinder network scaling was used to
remove redundant links and preserve the most salient
links only. Thus, networks in the two figures have the
identical set of articles and terms, but the pruned network
shown in Figure 3 has fewer links than the one in Figure
2. Because CITESPACE redraws the network completely
after pruning, the position of a node is likely to change in
the new layout. One can locate a cluster in the pruned
version based on the colors of links. For example, the
yellow cluster centered by word knowledge in the original
network shown in Figure 2 is transformed to a yellow
star-like structure in the pruned version.
In CITESPACE, users can interactively scale the font
sizes of labels. The branch at the lower left corner shows
that articles to do with visualizing multivariate
information have particularly cited Ware's 2000 book on
information visualization and Inselberg's 1990 article,
which in turn is often co-cited with Chernoff's 1973
article. These two articles are indeed about multivariate
information visualization. Furthermore, the presence of
the burst word multivariate told us that this pattern in fact
emerged in the latest time slice (2003-2004).

4.3.

Example B: Terrorism/Terrorists

The Terrorism/Terrorist dataset (1990-2004) contains
15,887 content words, including title words, abstract
words, descriptors, and identifiers. Among them, 235
words were detected to have significant bursts. A merged
network is shown, containing 91-nodes. Time slices and
thresholds used are detailed in Table 2.
In addition to burst detection for words, we
experimented burst detection for citations and expected
that articles with sudden citation jumps should be
representative in an image of a research front. The most
meaningful ranking was given by the reciprocal of burst
weight in Kleinberg's algorithm, shown as r in Table 3.

The sharpest citation jump was detected with
Schuster's 2001 article. Again, these are the first authors
only. This article started off with 14 citations in 2002 and
moved to 24 in 2003. Compared with other articles in the
table, this was indeed an abrupt raise. The Franz 1997
article has the longest burst span since 1999. It appears
other articles in the table tend to take off around the third
year of their publication. All articles in the table are
featured in the visualization (Figure 4 and Figure 5).

We include two versions of the network: first, the one
without pruning and then the one with pruning. The map
shows seven clusters in distinct colors, corresponding to
seven time slices. Unlike the Information Visualization
network, these clusters are isolated from one another at
this level. Terrorism/terrorist research may not like
information visualization as a coherent scientific subject
matter; rather, research in terrorism and terrorist activities
tends to be strongly driven by external events.

Figure 4 Thematic changes in the strongly event-driven terrorism/terrorist literature over time (19902004), including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing (green: 1994-1995), the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin
attack (pink: 1996-1997), anthrax and bioterrorism (yellow: 2000-2001), and the September 11 terrorist
attacks (red: 2002-2003).
This dataset generated a much larger pool of content
words (15,887). The resultant map contains many more
words than the Information Visualization map. The green
cluster (1994-1995), for example, contains Oklahoma,
Turkey, Israeli, and sarin. The Oklahoma City Bombing
was in April 1995. There was a major increase in nonlethal terrorist attacks against property in Turkey in 1995
by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK also

committed lethal acts of terrorism. Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish Israeli
extremist in November. In March 1995, members of the
Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo placed containers of the
deadly chemical nerve agent sarin on five trains of the
Tokyo subway system during the morning rush hour,
killing 12 persons. The attack was the first major use of
chemical weapons by terrorists.

The bright yellow cluster in the upper half of the map
corresponds to the time slice of 2000 and 2001. The most
prominent words are anthrax in 178 articles and
bioterrorism in 118 articles. The highly cited articles in
this period include Inglesby's 1999 article (14), Torok's
1997 article (14 citations within the period), and Franz's
1997 article (13). From the bibliography of these papers
listed below, one should be able to understand instantly
why an anthrax paper in terrorism research would cite
Inglesby's 1997 paper.

(2002-2003). Because words are also shown in red, the
words are barely readable. The second map was pruned
by Pathfinder algorithm. The significant messages from
the red cluster are clear. The cluster is dominated by a
large number of burst words, such as American (721),
networks (712), PTSD (634), September (400), China
(517), and smallpox (503). These words reflect the impact
of events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks on
issues that scientists were most concerned with.

PTSD stands for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The
National Center of PTSD was created within the
Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989, to address the
needs of veterans with military-related PTSD. The
National Center’s website highlights several events that
may cause PTSD, including the War in Iraq and the
September 11 anniversary.
Articles mostly cited in this context include Schuster
2001 (38), Galea 2002 (31), North 1999 (21), and
Schlenger 2002 (16). Their titles are listed below.

Schlenger WE, et al. (2002) Psychological reactions to
terrorist attacks. JAMA, 288:581-588.

On the one hand, the titles of these articles suggest that
these articles were cited in the context of how to handle
PTSD. The title words stress reactions, psychological
sequelae, psychiatric disorders, and psychological
reactions all reinforce the connections to PTSD after the
September 11 terrorist attacks. On the other hand, one
question would be why the words such as psychological
were absent from the visualization.
Overall the detection and visualization of citing words
and cited articles in a coherent framework have produced
clearer and more understandable representations of an
underlying research front. A link between a word and an
article in such maps clearly tells us something about why
the article was cited. The new method enables us to
present more information to the user than what traditional
co-citation analysis could do. In particular, the new
method strengthens co-citation analysis in the following
ways. First, the citing words provide a meaningful
labeling mechanism for identifying the nature of cocitation clusters. Traditionally labeling is a challenge in
co-citation analysis because of the lack of words available
in references. Citing words are more appropriate to be
used as labels than the references of articles. Second, the
provision of citing words in the process eases the latency
problem inherited by co-citation networks. Analysts no
longer have to wait until an article gathers sufficient
citations before one can take such articles into account.
Our approach establishes an important link between the
transient part of a research front and the intellectual base.
Third, the connection between word analysis and cocitation analysis provides valuable insights into the
potential impact of an emerging trend or a sudden change
of research focus. Fourth, the framework is extensible.
Additional heterogeneous interrelationships from
scientific publications can be integrated, such as authors,
authors' academic disciplines, and their geographic
locations, with content words and referenced articles.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the combination of content word
analysis and co-citation analysis within the same
analyzing and visualizing framework contributes to the
quantitative approach to the study of scientific literature.
We expect the combined representations of the transient

mapping from the state of the art of a field to the
intellectual base will enable scientists and other users to
track significant developments of a field in a holistic way.
Our method has expanded the scope of the coverage of
co-citation networks and content word networks if they
are used separately. The method is also extensible to
incorporate additional phenomena such as scientific
collaboration, social networks, and knowledge diffusion
across disciplinary as well as geographic boundaries.
