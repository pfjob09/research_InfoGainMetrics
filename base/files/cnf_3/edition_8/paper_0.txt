The enthusiasm for information visualization has generated a wide variety of interesting tools for multi-dimensional,
hierarchical, and other kinds of visualizations. However, some designs are readily accepted as understandable and
useful, while others are perceived as confusing and useless. Controlled studies have begun to sort of some of the
issues, but the insights of designers and usability tests are contributing interesting cognitive hypotheses for
researchers and practical guidelines for developers. This talk will offer examples of what works and what doesn't
with a preliminary set of principles that might have wide applicability.
BEN SHNEIDERMAN is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science Founding Director (1983-2000) of

Interaction (4th edition, April 2004) http://www.aw.com/DTUI/. His move into information visualization helped
spawn the successful company Spotfire http://www.spotfire.com/. He was an advisor for www.smartmoney.com
where his treemap idea was the basis for the marketmap. He is currently an advisor for ILOG (
http://www.ilog.com) and the HiveGroup (http://www.hivegroup.com). With S. Card and J. Mackinlay, he coauthored Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think (1999). Leonardo's Laptop: Human Needs
and the New Computing Technologies appeared in October 2002, and his new book with B. Bederson, The Craft of
Information Visualization: Readings and Reflections, was published in April 2003.
