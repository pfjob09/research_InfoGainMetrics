Abstract
Blending is an interesting subject in computer
graphics and CAD. Although surface blending has been
well studied, to our knowledge, solid blending remains a
blank research area. In this paper, we develop a partial
differential equation (PDE) based solid blending method
where a vector-valued fourth order PDE together with
some surface boundary conditions are involved. In order
to solve the partial differential equation, we propose an
approximate analytical method which satisfies all the
boundary conditions exactly. Unlike surface blending
which only gives the information on the blending surface,
solid blending represents properly not only the external
surface, but also the interior of the solid. Three examples
are given in the paper to demonstrate the applications of
the proposed method in solid blending.

1. Introduction
Surface blending is a well-researched subject in
geometric modelling. Various approaches have been
produced and used in engineering design, computer
graphics and computer animation. Solid bending which
smoothly connects two solids together, however, has not
been properly studied. Mathematically speaking, solid
modelling is a higher dimensional problem over surface
blending, i.e. it includes surface modelling as a subproblem. With solid blending, not only the surfaces, but
also the interior of the blended objects are smoothly
connected.
In addition to the obvious use of blending surfaces,
solid blending will be especially useful for situations
beyond geometric modelling. With the interior to be
represented properly, numerous applications, such as
finite element analysis, mass related dynamic
calculation, simulation of surgical operations with force

computation, can be achieved with a high degree of
accuracy.
Since solid blending is to create a solid volume that is
able to smoothly join two separate solid objects, it is a
complex problem. So far we have not seen any
substantial research efforts on the study of this topic,
despite the fact that blending surfaces have been an
active subject of geometric modelling for many years.
The rolling ball method is a main tool to blend
parametric surfaces. Depending on whether the radius of
the rolling ball varies, rolling ball blends are classified as
constant-radius and variable-radius blends. Choi and Ju
studied methods of constructing edge and corner blend
surfaces among rectangular parametric surface patches
using constant-radius rolling-ball method [1]. Sanglikar
et al. also developed a rolling ball based mathematical
model. The blending equations were formulated using
differential geometry and their closed form analytical
solutions were given for most of the surfaces, which are
common in solid modellers [2]. Barnhill et al. presented
a method for blending two parametric surfaces, which is
based on an algorithm calculating the intersection of two
offset surfaces using only the first-order derivatives of
the progenitors [3]. Variable-radius rolling ball blends
were examined by Chuang et al. They described some
methods that use the derived spine curve and linkage
curves to compute a parametric form of the variableradius spherical and circular blends [4]. Since the radius
is difficult to specify and the spine curve is hard to trace
in variable-radius blending, they imposed several
geometric constraints on the variable radius, which are
translated to a non-linear system to represent the spine
curve exactly [5]. More recently, Chuang and Lien
proposed two formulations for the general blending of
parametric surfaces. The first is an exact formulation and
represents the blend exactly in a high dimensional space
as the swept surface of the intersection between offsets
of base surfaces with radii satisfying a specific oneparameter curve. The second formulation is a relatively
more flexible one that defines the blend as the swept
surface of the intersection between offsets of base

surfaces with radii satisfying a specific two-parametric
surface [6].
Cyclides are important as well for some simple
surface blending. Cyclides can be described by implicit
quartic equations or in parametric form using
trigonometrical parameterization or rational biquadratic
Bézier equations. Blending using cyclides was
investigated by Allen and Dutta [7] and Shene [8].
Roach and Martin suggested the use of Fourier
methods for the generation of blends, which provide
smooth and fairing transitions between model surfaces
[9]. Kim and Elber presented a symbolic approach to the
computation of blend surfaces across piecewise
polynomial and rational parametric surfaces [10].
In the work of Bloor and Wilson, the blending is
regarded as a boundary value problem, which is to find
the solution to a vector-valued partial differential
equation under suitably defined boundary conditions
[11]. For such a method, the resolution of the partial
differential equation is crucial. Therefore, some methods
have been developed which include the finite element
method [12, 13], finite difference method [14, 15],
collocation method [16], Fourier series method [17] and
spectral method [18]. Since the vector-valued parameter
in the partial differential equation strongly affects the
shape of blending surfaces, You and Zhang proposed a
more general fourth order partial differential equation
[19], and applied it to the design of vase surfaces [20].
Zhang and You also discussed the efficiency and
capacity using different order partial differential
equations to generate free form surfaces [21] and
presented a design method to model tool surfaces for
metal forming using a single surface patch [22].
Using purely geometric methods, e.g. Bézier, Bspline or NURBS formulations, solid generation can be
performed. In addition to these common methods, there
have been some papers discussing solid modeling. For
example, Güdükbay and Özgüç discussed a number of
geometric modeling techniques with deformations
applied to them in attempts to combine various
approaches developed so far [23]. Mastin demonstrated
how rational Bézier basis functions can be used to
generate three-dimensional solids that can be used in
solid modeling and in the generation of grids [24]. Shin,
B.-S. and Shin, Y.G. proposed an efficient algorithm for
reconstructing solid models using geometric properties
and the topology of geometric primitives [25].
Raghothama and Shapiro gave a formal definition for
boundary representation (BR-) deformation for solids in
the same parametric family, based on the assumption of
continuity, which is small changes in solid parameter
values should result in small changes in the solid's
boundary representation, which may include local
collapses of cells in the boundary representation [26].
Hua and Qin presented a haptic sculpting system for
solids, based on scalar trivariate B-spline functions.
Three techniques (namely, hierarchical B-splines, CSGbased functional composition, and knot insertion) were
utilised to facilitate multi-resolution editing and differing
levels of detail [27]. García et al. presented a

mathematical model for the representation of free-form
solids whose boundaries are free-form surfaces
represented by a set of low degree triangular Bézier
patches (TBPs) and to operate with them [28].
PDE methods have also been applied to solid
modeling. Bloor and Wilson presented some examples of
special case solid volumes generated by solving a second
order PDE [29]. By combining a fourth-order elliptic
PDE for the definition of solid volumes with the equation
of motion from Dynamics, Du and Qin developed a
technique for modelling dynamic solids. In their
development, the finite difference discretization and the
multi-grid subdivision techniques were employed to
solve numerically the combined equation [30].
In this paper, we will discuss how to blend two solids
with a vector-valued PDE and how to solve the PDE
subject to the blending boundary conditions with an
approximate analytical method. Apart from accuracy,
this method is computationally very efficient.

2. Blending problem and resolution
Solid blending involves two types of solid objects.
The solids to be connected are called the blended solids
and the solid, which smoothly connects these blended
solids, is called the blending solid. The interface surfaces
between the blended solids and blending solid are called
boundary surfaces. The mathematical expressions, which
represent both positional and tangential continuities on
the boundary surfaces, are called the boundary
conditions.
As it is known, the solution to a two-dimensional
vector-valued partial differential equation gives a surface
in three-dimensional space. Similarly, the solution to a
three-dimensional vector-valued partial differential
equation can represent a solid in three-dimensional
space. Here, we represent the problem with such a threedimensional vector-valued partial differential equation,
which has the form of

w 4x
wu 4



w 4x
wv 4



(1)

where x(u , v, w) >x(u , v, w) y (u , v, w) z (u, v, w)@T
is a vector-valued positional function, and u , v and w
are three parametric variables.
For a solid blending problem, what’s most important
is that the positional and tangential (or possibly a higher
order) continuities must be satisfied between the blended
and blending solids. These boundary conditions can be
written as the following forms
wx
w 0
x S1 (u, v)
S 2 (u , v)
ww
(2)
wx
w 1
x S 3 (u, v)
S 4 (u , v)
ww
where S 1 (u, v) and S 3 (u, v) are the functions of the
boundary surfaces, and S 2 (u , v) and S 4 (u , v) are the
functions of the boundary tangents between the blended
solids and blending solid.

Clearly, for general cases, there is no analytical
solution of PDE (1) subjected to boundary conditions (2).
Numerical methods, such as the finite element method
and finite difference method, can be used to solve this
problem. However, two issues are unavoidable when
using the numerical methods. One is their expensive
computational cost. And the other is that the boundary
conditions cannot be exactly satisfied due to the discrete
nature of the numerical methods. Here we introduce an
approximate analytical solution, which will overcome
both problems.
The main idea is to construct a proper trial function to
represent the blending solid. This trial function should
satisfy the boundary conditions exactly. We propose the
following form for this function
x f1 (u, v)  wf 2 (u , v )  w 2 f 3 (u , v)  w 3 f 4 (u, v)
f f f
(3)
 ¦ ¦ ¦ a lmn sin lSu sin mSv sin 2 nSw
l 1 m 1n 1

where f1 (u, v) , f 2 (u, v) , f 3 (u , v) and f 4 (u, v) are the
vector-valued unknown functions which will be
determined by the boundary conditions, and a lmn is a
vector-valued unknown constant which will be
determined by PDE (1). This trial function, as we will
show below, satisfies the boundary conditions exactly,
and also approximates PDE (1) with a good degree of
accuracy. In the following, we will determine the
unknown quantities.
Differentiating Eq. (3) with respect to w , taking
w 0 and w 1 in the expressions of w and wx ,
ww
respectively, substituting them into the boundary
conditions (2), and solving for f1 (u, v) , f 2 (u, v) ,
f 3 (u , v) and f 4 (u, v) , we obtain
f1 (u , v)

Substituting Eq. (4) back into Eq. (3), the
mathematical expression of the blending solid becomes

In order to determine the remaining unknown

the following vector-valued residual function is obtained

number of collocation points as that of the unknown
constants a lmn within the solution region 0 d u d 1 ,

The resolution of Eq. (7) determines the rest
unknown constants a lmn . Then, the blending solid can

be generated with Eq. (5).

3. Blending applications
With the above-proposed method, the blending
between two solids can be conveniently carried out. In
this section, we give three examples to demonstrate the
application of this method.
Generally, the solids to be blended can always be
described with parametric functions. Fixing the value of
one of parameters in the functions, we can obtain
boundary surfaces. The boundary tangential functions
can be derived from the mathematical expressions of the
solids. These functions of the boundary surfaces and
tangents constitute the boundary conditions of the
blending problem. Then, the mathematical description of
the blending solid can be achieved by solving PDE (1)
subjected to these boundary conditions.
The first example is to blend two cubes of different
sizes. The boundary conditions defining the blending
solid between these cubes can be formulated as

Since the right-hand side of Eq. (14) is always zero,
all the unknown constants a lmnx , a lmny and a lmnz take

the values of zero and Eq. (13) gives the accurate
solution of this blending problem. With the obtained
mathematical expressions of the blending solid, the
transition part between the two cubes is depicted in Fig.
1a. Evidently, the blending solid smoothly connects the
upper and lower cubes together.
In Fig. 1b, the iso-parametric surface of Fig. 1a at
u 2  v 2 1 is depicted. It can be observed that the
continuity between the three solids on this iso-parametric
surface is well maintained.
The second example is to blend a circular cylinder
with an elliptic cylinder. From the representation of a
cylinder, the boundary conditions for this blending task
are written as

Due to the complicated mathematical representations

Conclusions
[12]

Solid blending is a complicated geometric modelling
problem. Despite its importance and potential
applications in many graphics and engineering design, it
has not been seriously studied.
In this paper, we have presented an effective method
for the generation of a blending solid between two solid
objects to be blended. For this aim, a three-dimensional
vector-valued partial differential equation was introduced
and the boundary conditions used for the blending were
defined. The mathematical functions of the blending
solid were constructed and the resolution method was
proposed. As the blending solid is given in an analytical
form, it is computational very efficient.
With the proposed method, three blending examples
were given to demonstrate the applications in solid
blending. They indicate that the generated blending
solids meet the boundary conditions and smoothly join
the solids together. Unlike the closed form resolution
method, which can only treat a small amount of very
simple boundary conditions, the proposed method can
create solids with arbitrarily complex boundary
conditions.
This paper only describes our first attempt in the
modelling of blending solids. There are many things to
be done and can be done for its improvement. We hope
this paper will inspire further efforts from the research
community to come up with better ideas.
