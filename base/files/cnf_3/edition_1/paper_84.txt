Abstract— Medical imaging techniques produce very large
amounts of data, that have to be transmitted or stored, and
therefore, there is a need for image compression. Fractal
image compression still suffers from a high encoding time.
We propose a new optimization approach to reduce the time
of fractal image encoding. This approach is a hybridization
of the SPIHT algorithm and Jacquin-style coding scheme.
Our approach was tested on mammography images of MIAS
database.

INTRODUCTION

TABLE 1. OBTAINED RESULTS

Fractal compression is a lossy compression method,
introduced by Barnsley and Jacquin [1]. It is based on
Iterated Function Systems (IFS) which exploits the self
similarity between the parts of the image.
Different works shows that the Fractal compression
method is one of very effective compression methods [2].
But the time of fractal image encoding is important, that
is due to the great number of comparisons between the
destination range blocks and the source domain blocks.
The minimization of the source and destination blocks is
one of the solutions of time reduction of fractal image
encoding. Many approaches to solving this problem have
been proposed [3][4].
This paper presents a hybrid scheme coding using
SPHIT and fractal for mammography image compression.

Figure 1 shows that the quality of reconstructed
images strongly depends on the number of quantified
blocks and the errors of coding is located primarily at
contours of the images. The obtained results (see TABLE
1) seem to show that the quality of the reconstructed
mammography images is very good and the encoding
time (evaluated in seconds) is reduced. The conclusion is
that the obtained results seem to be satisfactory.

Our proposed approach is based on the hybridization
of fractals and SPIHT algorithm [5]. The source image to
be compressed is first of all decomposed into Wavelets
(decomposition using bi-orthogonal Wavelets). This gives
place of the coefficients of high value; a scalar
quantization will be then applied to the coefficients of the
details by building a tree of the coefficients of the
significant values. Then a coding with loss on the
approximations of significant values is applied.
