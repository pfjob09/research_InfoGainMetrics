Abstract—Rapid Serial Visual Presentations (RSVPs) mimic
the rifﬂing of a book’s pages and are widely employed as a way
of gaining familiarity with a collection of images or selecting
images of interest from a collection.
In a typical RSVP a number of images within a collection
enter a display in (say) the lower left-hand corner and move
towards the opposite corner where they disappear (‘diagonal
RSVP’). If the rate at which images appear on the display is
high, the speed with which images traverse the display may be
such that the images overlap to some degree. As a consequence
there is a need to know how much overlap can be tolerated
without seriously affecting image recognition.
Diagonal RSVP was implemented for four different levels of
overlap and four different image speeds in such a way as to
separate the effects of these two parameters. Participants were
required to identify theme images (such as ‘ships’ or ‘cars’) in
a series of image sequences at various combinations of speed
and overlap. In addition to recording their performance, participants also completed a questionnaire to gauge their opinion
on perceived presentation speed and ease of recognition.
Results showed a signiﬁcant effect of both overlap and speed
on the percentage of correctly identiﬁed images. On the basis
of the experimental results suggestions are made concerning
interaction design for RSVP.

notably in relation to inherently smaller screen dimensions.
Most RSVP designs present images at a predetermined rate;
Witkowski et al. [6] embed an RSVP design into a kiosk for
product browsing and selection, in which the user has direct
control of both image presentation speed and direction.
Cooper et al. [7] evaluated the comparative performance
of users of six different RSVP designs, while monitoring
their eye-gaze activities. de Bruijn and Spence [8] have
investigated eye-gaze behaviour for a number of different
RSVP visualisations, including a ‘carousel’ mode (Figure 1b). In ‘carousel’ mode, images appear small at the
top of the screen, move clockwise increasing in size to the
bottom, and disappear again at the top.
Corsato et al. [9] investigated both comparative performance and user preference for a number of more complex
RSVP forms (including ‘volcano’ mode, Figure 1c). In
‘volcano’ mode images appear at the centre of the screen
and successively move to the edges, reducing in size before
disappearing. Corsato et al. also included a study of eyegaze movement characteristics across the different modes
tested, indicating that design has a substantial effect on gaze
behaviour and that this is correlated with image recognition
rates.
Wittenburg et al. [10] have considered the effects of
simulated depth using perspective and occlusion methods. In

I. I NTRODUCTION
Rifﬂing the pages of a book in order to gain some familiarity with its contents or to conduct a search is a simple form
of Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) [1], [2]. The
computational embodiment of RSVP leads to considerable
ﬂexibility in the mode of presentation, four of which are
shown in Figure 1. In each mode images from a collection
are introduced in turn at a given location, move along a
trajectory and then disappear from view. The experiments in
this paper use ‘diagonal’ mode (Figure 1a). In this diagonal
mode, images appear in the bottom left and move at constant
speed to the top right.
The technique of RSVP ﬁnds a wide range of applications.
In e-commerce, for example, Wittenburg et. al. [3] explore
various RSVP like designs, speciﬁcally for inclusion into
consumer electronic products, notably for TV channel surfing and visualisation of VCR style fast-forward and editing
tasks (Figure 1d). Tse et al. [4] investigated augmented
‘gist’ acquisition for ﬁlm browsing. de Bruijn & Tong [5]
investigated the selection of news reports on a mobile,

a related development Sun and Guimbreti`ere [11] describe
‘Flipper’, a novel method for document navigation.
In RSVPs containing moving images it may often be
preferable, for whatever reason, to cause the images to
overlap each other to some extent, a condition illustrated for
all the examples of RSVP shown in Figure 1. For any given
image size, the number of images on the screen at any one
time is determined by the interlinked factors of pace (rate of
new images appearing onscreen), image speed and overlap.
The question then arises as to how occlusion of one
image by the next affects a user’s ability to recognise some
feature of that obscured image. Since, for a given pace of
image appearance on the display, overlap can be diminished
or avoided by speeding up the movement of images, it is
therefore essential to investigate the separate effects of image
speed and overlap. The experiment described in this paper
was devised to identify these independent effects on the
ability of a user to recognise images satisfying a given theme
(e.g. ‘car’, ‘ship’ or ‘ﬂower’).
The approach adopted here to separate out the independent
effects of overlap and image speed is presented in Section II
by a speciﬁc but artiﬁcial experimental design. This design
ensures that overlap and speed are independent.
The diagonal RSVP mode (see Figure 1a) was chosen
for investigation because this mode or a minor variant of
it is incorporated in most designs. The task assigned to
the user was that of identifying, by space-bar press, those
target images within a collection (of 200) characterised by a
particular theme. Although unknown to the participant, there
were always 10 target images in each presentation. After the
presentation of each image collection, subjects were asked
to answer three simple questions concerning their perception
of image speed and identiﬁcation success.
The experimental design is described in Section III.
Section IV describes the experimental procedure used. Section V presents an analysis and discussion of the results
obtained. Section VI provides a summary and further discussion of the experiment. In Section VII we derive, from
the experimental results, some notes of guidance to the
interaction designer faced with the task of designing an
RSVP for a particular application. The ﬁnal section presents
some brief conclusions from the study.

Figure 2. A typical RSVP display as used in practice, showing image
occlusion due to overlap

Figure 3. A typical RSVP design modiﬁed for experimental purposes to
address obscurement

as shown in Figure 3 purely for experimental purposes. This
experimental RSVP was so arranged that throughout the
investigation, the same number of images (or part images)
were visible. The consequence of overlap was reﬂected in the
varying obscurement of each image at one of four possible
values illustrated in Figure 4. Independently of the degree of
obscurement, four image speeds were investigated, but the
rate at which images became visible (pace) was adjusted to
keep the number of images on screen constant.
III. E XPERIMENTAL D ESIGN
To investigate these parameters the number of images
visible on the screen was kept constant, while the degree of
obscurement was increased to emulate the effects of overlap.
Four levels of obscurement were investigated: 0%, 25%,
50% and 75% (Figure 4). Figure 3 shows how this appears
to the participant at 25% obscurement. At 0% obscurement
the images just abut each other in this design.
The ﬁnal experimental design adopted four linear image
speeds across the screen, equating to 1005, 1612, 2246 and
2856 pixels/s. Table I indicates the consequences of this
choice in terms of total travel time for any image across
the whole screen, the rate at which images appear on the

II. I NVESTIGATING OVERLAP
The purpose of these experiments was to test the combined effects of image speed and obscurement due to overlap
as might be encountered in various RSVP designs. Our
approach to a study of the effect of image overlap was to
focus on two important features of an RSVP such as the
exemplar shown in Figure 2. The two features are the degree
of overlap and the speed at which the images move across
the screen.
To isolate the independent effects of overlap and image
speed the diagonal RSVP shown in Figure 2 was modiﬁed

The Graeco-Latin square design

(British) phoneboxes, watches, and submarines. For each test
the associated image set was also randomised to minimise
the possibility of systematic error. The 3200 required images
were sourced on-line, and represented a broad range of
professional and amateur contributions.
The sequences were carefully chosen to equalise the
relative difﬁculty of targets, the locations of identifying
image features, and the target distribution within each set. In
particular, care was taken to ensure that no target followed
another by less than the time on screen, plus one second.
This design also eliminates the possibility of attentional
blink effects [12].
Prior to each presentation the participant was shown a
screen indicating the target theme they were to identify.
Participants were required to press the keyboard spacebar
once (Figure 6) each time they identiﬁed a target image. The
time of each spacebar activation was recorded automatically
and subsequently compared to the actual time of target
presentations to determine the accuracy data.
A Graeco-Latin square design [13] was adopted to distribute the combinations of speed and obscurment fairly. The
square adopted is shown in Figure 5. The various schedules
of combinations used for every participant were then derived
from the square following normal practice.
During testing the experimenter was seated behind the
participant, out of sight and otherwise non-interfering. This
was done in an attempt to reduce potential impact of
observation on the results (Figure 6), while allowing the
experimenter full control of the procedure.

screen, the duration of each presentation of 200 images, and
the equivalent speed in cm/s. Presentations were made on a
19” (48.3 cm diagonal) LCD monitor with a native display
resolution of 1280x1024. Participants were seated a nominal
60 cm from the screen.
These ﬁnal choices of obscurement and image speed were
selected following pilot studies of eight participants. The
trials were conducted both to test and reﬁne the experimental software and procedures, and to ensure that the test
parameters bounded the range of interest. Initial trials used
obscurement levels of 0, 15, 30 and 45% and speeds of 666,
999, 1665 and 2856 pixels/s. It was clear that higher levels of
obscurement were required to fully test the range of effects,
and that the lower speed range was too slow to challenge
the participants.
Each test represented a different combination resulting
from varying the speed and obscruement of each image set.
With four speeds and four levels of obscurement this resulted
in 16 separate tests. To ensure a fair test this required 16
separate image sets each consisting of 200 unique images,
so that participants only saw each image-set once.
Within each set, 10 target images drawn from a target
theme were pseudo-randomly placed in the sequence. Participants used each target theme only once. Each target
theme was drawn from one of 16 easily recognised categories: birds, cars, chairs, dogs, ﬁsh, ﬂowers, aeroplanes,
ships, horse, hot air balloons, hats, oranges, (military) tanks,

A. Subjective Questionnaire
As an integral part of the experimental design, each participant was required to answer three questions about their
perceptions as to the speed of presentation, their conﬁdence
in seeing the targets and the overall difﬁculty of recognition
during the test. The questions, as presented, are shown in
Table II. Answers were recorded on an appropriate ﬁve-point
scale, in the manner of a Likert design.
Since the participant ﬁlled out the relevant questions after
each test (as opposed to at the end of the entire session) the

example “In the next presentation, the theme you are looking
for is dogs.” The participant pressed the spacebar to start
the presentation, when they were ready. Each of the sixteen
presentations lasted between 24 and 69 seconds (Table I). At
the end of each presentation they were then asked to answer
each of the three questions from the questionnaire sheet, by
highlighting one of the ﬁve options.
Following, and during, all sixteen presentations, any comments made by the participants were noted. The total time
for each participant was between 15 and 20 minutes. No
reward was offered for taking part.
V. A NALYSIS OF R ESULTS
Figure 6.

View of the experimental set-up

This section presents a discussion of the results obtained
from the 320 individual presentations made during the main
experiment, and summarises the results of the subjective
questionnaire completed after each of the presentations.
This discussion is broken down into different sections: a
general overview of the results; a comparison and analysis
of the effects of speed and obscurement; an examination
of any learning effects; and an analysis of the participant questionnaire results. In the analysis that follows, the
Accuracy measure reﬂects the number of instances where
the participant recorded a space bar press while a target
image was present on the screen (plus one second following
to allow for reaction time, reﬂecting the design criteria,
section III).
Accuracy is deﬁned as the number of targets correctly
identiﬁed within a sequence as a fraction of the total (10);
these are the True Positives (TP). Accuracy may also be
expressed as a percentage. False Positives (FP), where the
participant indicated a target where none was present, were
also recorded. The Accuracy measure is independent of the
False Positive value.

IV. E XPERIMENTAL P ROCEDURE
A total of 20 volunteers drawn from the general student
and research population participated in the main experiment,
15 male, ﬁve female. Although none were directly familiar
with the RSVP methodology, all were highly technically
literate and experienced computer users.
After welcome, participants were seated comfortably, the
general purpose of the experiment explained and consent
obtained. Each participant was then shown an example of
the diagonal RSVP presentation style to be used, at moderate
speed and without obscurement. There was no interaction
during the example presentation. Participants were carefully
instructed to press the space bar on the keyboard once
whenever they saw a picture with the target type in it,
for example a ‘dog’. Participants were not informed of the
number of target images in each presentation sequence. Each
participant was then asked if this was clear and any required
clariﬁcations were made.
Participants then each completed 16 presentation trials,
at different speed and obscurement levels, in a schedule
described previously (Figure 5). Prior to each of the sixteen
presentations, an on-screen prompt informed the participants
of the image theme they were required to identify, for

A. General Overview of Results
Figure 7 provides an overview of the major ﬁndings of
the experiment. The bubble chart shows the combined effect
of obscurement and speed across the range of experimental
parameters. The width of each bubble reﬂects the Accuracy
of identiﬁcation at each setting.
As expected, there is a pronounced effect on Accuracy
of both speed and obscurement. However, it may be seen
that the difference between 0 and 25% obscurement is very
slight, in contrast to the more substantive effects between
25% and 50% and 50% to 75% obscurement. In contrast,
Figure 7 indicates a progressive effect of speed on Accuracy.
This is considered in more detail in section V-B, and is
presented as an interpolated contour surface in Figure 16.
Figure 8 shows the average number of False Positives
across the combinations of speed and occlusion. A False
Positive indicates that a button press was recorded but did
not correspond to a target.

2246 pixels/s, 4.9 (SD = 3.2) and for 2856 pixels/s, 3.4
(SD = 2.8). Each is the result of averaging over the
speed measurements across all obscurements (0%, 25%,
50%, 75%). We note the associated standard deviations (as
denoted by the error bars shown on the ﬁgure) are fairly
large, due to the range of obscurements used, and that the
Standard Deviations (SD) are quite similar. Figure 9 also
indicates a very strong negative linear correlation between
speed and true positives (R2 = 0.986).
Table III shows the Tukey multiple comparison p-values
for all combinations of speed (N ≈ 80), indicating that each
of the four accuracy values are distinct at p < 0.05.
The False Positives shown in Figure 9 (lower) also exhibit a negative trend with increased speed, consistent with
Figure 8. The relatively high SD across the False Positive
values is indicative of the variability of the candidates’
behaviours.
Figure 10 shows a non-linear relationship between obscurement and Accuracy. Note the similarity between 0%
obscurement (M = 7.5, SD = 2.6) and 25% obscurement
(M = 7.2, SD = 2.6). Table IV shows that the p-value
(p = 0.7580) for a Tukey comparison between the 0 and
25% obscurements is clearly non-signiﬁcant at the p < 0.05
level. This is in stark contrast to other Tukey comparisons
of the remaining obscurements (25 to 50 and 50 to 75) as

Speed (pixels/s)

Results across speeds

False Positives when varying speed and obscurement

Whilst the actual numbers of False Positives are overall
relatively small (all less than two per presentation) it is
interesting to note the level of correlation between ‘high
difﬁculty’ combinations (upper right, Figure 8) and smaller
average instances of false positives. We postulate that this
is due to participants ‘giving up’ on tests they deem too
hard and appear to be hesitant to press the space bar if
at all. Furthermore, we observed that participants would
raise their ﬁngers above the spacebar during these difﬁcult
presentations, while they would tend to rest their ﬁngers on
the bar during more tractable combinations.
B. Speeds and Obscurements
In order to allow a more detailed assessment of the
difference between the different speeds and obscurements,
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the averaged results for speed
and obscurement respectively. For example Figure 9 shows
that at a speed of 1005 pixels/s there are 7.1 (SD = 2.9)

shown in Table IV, which are clearly distinct. Again we note
a high variability in False Positives across the individual
participants (Figure 10, lower).
Figure 11 emphasises the similarities between the effect
on the spread of number of targets correctly identiﬁed at
0% and 25% obscurement (Figure 11, top left and top
right). These are both heavily skewed toward the correctly
identiﬁed part of the histogram. At 50% obscurement (Figure 11, bottom left), the spread of correctly identiﬁed targets
is largely even, whereas 75% (Figure 11, bottom right)
obscurement clearly indicates that few targets are identiﬁed
correctly for the majority of presentations. There is a similar
effect for speeds, but it is not as pronounced.

Potential learning effect

It should be noted that a potential ‘learning effect’ did
play a part in the questionnaire, as participants would rate
the slowest speed much slower than initially, once they had
experienced the fastest possible speed (question one).
D. Participant Questionnaire Findings
This section presents the ﬁndings from the user opinion
survey (Section III-A). Figure 13 summarises the results for
question 1 “How did you ﬁnd the speed of this presentation”,
asked after every presentation. The response ‘Just Right’ is
assigned a value of zero, ‘Fast’ and ‘Very Fast’ positive
values one and two respectively; the responses ‘Slow’ and
‘Very Slow’ values of minus one and minus two respectively;
the permissible range is therefore −2 to +2. Fast values are
shown on Figure 13 as ﬁlled upward pointing triangles, slow
values as downward pointing triangles. Smaller triangles are
therefore closer to the ideal.
It may be seen that the slowest speed (1005 pixels/s)
was found to be very close to ‘Just Right’. On average
the second speed (1612 pixels/s) was considered just below

C. Learning Effect
Figure 12 shows the average score across all participants
in the order of test presentation. To the extent possible
the experimental design distributed easy and difﬁcult combinations evenly across the presentations. The absence of
any substantive improvement across the successive tests
indicates that there is no signiﬁcant learning effect for this
type of RSVP design, implying that users found the RSVP
style intuitive. Error bars indicate the Standard Deviation
(N = 20). The error bars are large (and therefore only
indicative) as each test position contains presentations at
every speed and obscurement combination.

Question 1: Speed (range −2 to +2)

‘Fast’. The two highest speeds (2246 and 2856 pixels/s)
were both between ‘Fast’ and ‘Very Fast’, with the highest
speed almost uniformly considered ‘Very Fast’ (average
1.76 of maximum value 2). Recall that the range of speeds
was partially determined by a sample of eight pilot study
participants, where the trial’s’ slowest speed was evaluated
as ‘Very Slow’, and which was also reported as unreasonably
slow. Note that obscurement has little apparent effect on the
perception of speed in these trials.
Figure 14 shows the results from the question: “How
Conﬁdent were you that you saw all the targets?” with 1
being the lowest conﬁdence answer (‘Not At All’) and 5
being the highest (‘Very Conﬁdent’). It is interesting to note
that participants were on aggregate only between ‘Fairly’
(3, central value) and ‘Quite Conﬁdent’ (4) even at the
low speed, low obscurement presentations. Comparison with
the measured Accuracy results shown in Figure 7 indicates
that, on balance, participants were generally pessimistic
about their performance under the most benign conditions
compared to their actual performance. Conﬁdence falls with
increases in both speed and obscurement, largely mirroring
the measured Accuracy values.
Figure 15 shows the results in response to the question
“Did you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to recognise the targets?” Results
are in the range 5 (‘Very Easy’) to 1 (‘Very Difﬁcult’).
As with question two, for the benign settings for speed
and obscurement, participants generally underestimate their
performance regarding Accuracy, but become more realistic
at the challenging settings.

level or range and simply read off a combination of speed
and obscurement that would meet their requirements. Note
that this Figure extrapolates the accuracy level to 100%
obscurement (where it may reasonably be assumed that there
can only be 0% Accuracy).
Note again that the effects of speed and obscurement are
not generally equivalent, the effect of speed being largely
linear over the range tested; whereas the effect of obscurement is minimal at low values, but increasingly pronounced
at higher values. This is reﬂected in the shape of the contour
lines presented in Figure 16.
Results from the subjective questionnaires indicate that
the participants considered the speeds of presentation employed to range from ‘Just Right’ for the slowest speed to
‘Very Fast’ for the two faster speeds. Opinion about speed
was apparently independent of the degree of obscurement
used in the presentations.

VII. D ESIGN C ONSIDERATIONS

2.5

The experiment described in this paper keeps separate
the effects of image speed and the degree to which images
are obscured. In normal practice, this obscuration would
be as a consequence of images overlapping, as shown in
Figure 2. This artiﬁcial separation results in the obscurement
of images shown in Figure 3. This ensures the same number
of images (and part-images) are on the screen at the same
time regardless of which speed or obscurement levels are
selected.
The interaction designer may be more concerned with
the effect on accuracy of pace, rather than image speed.
Since image speed, overlap and pace are simply related,
it is possible to transform the experimental data gathered
in these experiments to generate Figure 18, under a single
assumption. The assumption is that the accuracy of target
identiﬁcation is a function only of image speed and occlusion and is independent of pace. This conjecture is as
yet unproven, though various previous studies give us some
conﬁdence in its validity. The assumption needs to be tested
by future experiment.
Accepting the assumption, Figure 18 shows the freedom
of design choice of pace and overlap available for a speciﬁed
minimum Accuracy level of theme target. The area shown in
Figure 18 represents the range of the experimental evidence,
the other areas represent image presentation speeds that fall
outside our previously identiﬁed useful boundaries (too fast
or too slow).

Correlation of Opinion to Performance

tween participants’ opinion of their performance compared
to the actual performance as measured, across all combinations of speed and occlusion. The linear regression ﬁt, R2 ,
for question 2 is 0.94; R2 for question 3 is 0.91.
It would seem to be an attractive property of a presentation
design that users’ intuitive perception of their performance
matches that which they actually achieve. However, it remains unclear as to why participants are generally more
pessimistic than they need be at slower speeds and lower
obscurement levels, even though they are, by and large,
properly pessimistic about their performance at the more
challenging settings.
Given the ubiquity of the problems associated with speed
and overlap in RSVP design, this paper has been concerned
solely with design performance issues. While we have used
a highly controlled experimental design, we consider our
results may well prove useful for interaction designers developing a wide-range of RSVP designs. It should also be noted
that the effects of image presentation rate on individuals’
cognitive ability to both recognise and remember images
has been extensively studied e.g. [14], [15], however such

VIII. C ONCLUSIONS
This paper identiﬁes and investigates the independent
effect of image obscurement and image speed in a diagonal
RSVP. We observed a strongly proportional effect of speed
on accuracy, but that small amounts of obscurement had

10

relatively little effect, although this increased markedly
with further obscurement. Under the stated assumptions,
we present our ﬁndings in a form (Figure 18) that allows
a visual designer to choose an efﬁcacious combination of
image speed, overlap and pace to achieve a desired accuracy
of target image recognition.
