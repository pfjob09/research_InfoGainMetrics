interaction between professions and other stakeholders in
urban conservation process.
Two main parameters are identified in describing and
developing the efficiency of visualization techniques. These
are spatial abstraction level from high to low geometric
content and functionality on spatial data analysis and
visualization [4]. Spatial abstraction parameter investigates
the level of geometric and spatial content that visualization
technique represents in computer interface. Functionality
parameter defines the reliability and accuracy level of
visualized information in the technique while interpreting the
representation level of real space in virtual interface [1].
By the technological improvements in CAD, especially
3D models offer more efficient and practical processes
throughout developing capability of representation and
abstraction level of spatial content [1]. Another function of
these models is the communication and interaction capability
in urban planning and design process among users in
different background [2]. As the technology growth in CAD
applications, 3D urban models are used not only for the
purpose of a mere visualization media but also a design aid
while achieving an efficient interface in communicative
urban design process [5].
As the fundamental function of 3D urban models,
communication and interaction function facilitate the
participation and collaboration processes in urban planning.
Then such communication and interaction tools develop
learning skills [6] and cognition and perception abilities of
users and professions in planning and design disciplines [7],
[8]. Hence the discussions related to these abilities of
learning, cognition and evaluation processes of users and
stakeholders, especially professions and other authorities is
necessary to enhance the functional efficiency of 3D
visualization techniques.
The number of studies concerning the investigation of
users’ subjective responses for 3D visualization techniques
in urban planning and architectural design processes has
increased recently. These studies mainly focus on two
research questions. The first one is to which degree of
realism 3D virtual environments can represent the real
environment [9], [10], [11]. The second research question in
related literature is to what extent various visualization
techniques can represent the spatial or visual content [12],
[13].

Abstract— This paper compares efficiency of two and threedimensional visualization techniques which are developed for
representation of spatial content of an urban historic site. The
aim of this paper is to measure users’ perception regarding the
performance of these visualization techniques. Methodology is
based on a questionnaire which is gathering the user’s
responses regarding comprehension and perception level of the
case area’s characteristics. The case study, which was held in
Zeyrek urban historic site, comprises the application of 2D and
3D figures and schemes in order to represent the site
characteristics, survey and analysis and proposals. As the
fundamental finding of the study, it is concluded that spatial
attributes and characteristics in 3D urban models are better
defined than in 2D mapping technique. The study indicates
that orientation sense of users and cognition of the townscape
characteristics are the most prominent components of 3D
urban model, generated within this case study.

INTRODUCTION

Investigation of visualization technique’s efficiency is
important with the reliability of the technique regarding
representation level of the spatial content in the process of
urban planning, communication and interaction among user
groups. Computer aided three-dimensional (3D) urban
models as innovative visualization techniques, have more
capability to attain communication between user groups and
to visualize comprehensive spatial information than
conventional two-dimensional (2D) visualization techniques
[1]. But 3D urban models are occasionally used to represent
the final view of the urban structure and expressions of
planning and design proposals. In urban conservation and
design process, these models produce realistic images and
views to facilitate not only the actual urban pattern but also
proposed urban structure and form in order to evaluate the
planning decisions [2], [3].
Comprehensive spatial analyses and investigations are
required in urban planning and conservation studies devoted
to evaluation of urban historic sites. Efficiency levels of
visualization techniques may vary in the different stages of
urban conservation process. Then examination of negative
and positive aspects of these techniques has been anticipated
to provide contributions directly to communication and

Then this paper examines the efficiency of 2D and 3D
visualization techniques those were developed for the case
area, Zeyrek Urban Historic site, which is located in the
north of the Historical Peninsula of Istanbul, Turkey.
The aim of this paper is to measure users’ perception
regarding the performance of 2D and 3D visualization
techniques. Motivation of this paper is based on improving
especially the tasks of 3D urban model as an active
communication tool that is integrated with urban
conservation. This examination was conducted using a
questionnaire which compared the perceived level of spatial
content of the site, represented by 2D mapping technique and
3D models.

communication tools have assessed visualization techniques
in terms of representation capability on urban conservation.
A. Visualization Techniques in Zeyrek
Zeyrek is located in the north of Historical Peninsula of
Istanbul, on the slopes, viewing Golden Horn. In 1983
Zeyrek, as a quarter of Istanbul was included in the World
Heritage List because of historical, aesthetical and
architectural characteristics. Most important monument of
the site is Mosque of Zeyrek that had been Monastery of
Christ Pantokrator in Byzantium Period. Variety on cultural
structure of the site is reflected to urban space that has
traditional organic pattern, constituted with authentic timber
Turkish houses [15].
In separate presentations, prepared within these 2D and
3D visualization techniques, “Zeyrek Urban Conservation
and Design Project” [15] have been re-arranged within the
purpose of the questionnaire. Presentation of “Zeyrek Urban
Conservation and Design Project” which takes
approximately ten-minute long is mainly formed of three
stages. The first stage is preparation of base map and 3D
urban model (Figure 1).
All maps and figures in both presentations, uses the same
data, based on digital maps from municipality, on-site
survey, and previous conservation and design studies and
inventories prepared for Zeyrek urban historic site. Of all
stages, as a CAD system AutoCAD 2004© is used to
constitute 2D mapping technique and 3D urban model.

METHODOLOGY IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE

This paper is based on the research held within the PhD
study in 2009 [14]. A broader questionnaire study in 2008
was conducted to gather responses from various kinds of
users, respectively graduate students in Faculty of
Architecture, professions in planning and conservation
institutions and high school students as the representatives of
inhabitants. In the questionnaire, results of which are given
in this paper, graduate students’ responses have been
investigated in two different groups; 2D mapping as the
conventional representation technique and 3D urban model
(in separate groups after separate presentations). Planning
and design graduate students who are familiar to visual

characteristics. All these survey and analysis were first
constructed in 2D maps and then 3D urban model in the
same topics and titles. The last stage is developing a plan
proposal for the conservation of Zeyrek Urban Historic Site.
While the survey and analysis were held in both 2D
mapping and 3D urban model techniques, opportunities were
determined to define townscape and urban pattern
parameters [14]. Contrary to the conventional survey and
analysis, spatial data mostly related to privacy and façade
characteristics were better represented in 3D urban models.

After the preparation of the base map and 3D urban
model, the second stage is surveying and evaluation of
townscape. Survey and physical analysis was held in firstly
conventional analysis which contains common evaluation of
building and structures as, building uses, condition,
construction material, built-up and inbuilt-up areas, and
finally listed buildings. Then evaluation of townscape and
conservation potential of the historic urban pattern was
assessed in parameters titled as structure, façade,
accessibility – privacy, and harmony with local architectural

The respondents’ ages in the professional group ranged
from 21 to 32 years, with an average of 24,40 years
(S.D.=2.624, median 24). Computer experience in the
sample has been taken into consideration as the profile of
respondents. 14 respondents have been using computer for
less than nine years; 22 respondents between 10-14 years and
9 respondents between 15-19 years. Another indicator for
computer experience is the use of computer aided design
software. Of all respondents, only three graduate students do
not use any computer aided design software in their
professional and educational works or studies. But less
respondents use 3D modelling software as in the quantity of
15 respondents. Of respondents in the first group, only four
respondents use 3D modelling software. In the other group
who evaluated 3D urban model, eleven persons use these
techniques. Between respondent groups, no statistically
significant differences were found for the variables of age or
computer experience.

B. Questionnaire
Questionnaire mainly consists of three parts as
comprehension – perception level of site characteristics in
the conservation and design project; efficiency of
visualization and representation technique; and perception of
components described in semantic scale. This paper
comprises only the results of the first section the
questionnaire. Each separate groups answered the same
topics, covered the extent how they comprehend and
perceived each figure and map and how they evaluated the
efficiency of each techniques as 2D and 3D visualization
technique.
All the questions in the questionnaire were conducted in
a seven level - Likert scale with 1: “poor” and 7: “excellent”.
Ten-minute long presentations which were prepared with 2D
mapping and 3D urban model were presented to two separate
groups. Then respondents were asked to describe their
comprehension and perception level for site characteristics in
Zeyrek Urban Conservation and Design Project.
Results according to responses from graduate students
have been analyzed with a specific statistical method, Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which is a statistical analysis
to attain weightings of variables to discriminate between
separate groups [16]. LDA, which uses a function based on
measuring the distance between two groups, has F-test
analysis application module in SPSS software that allows
indicating the significance of differences of means from
separate groups.

RESULTS: COMPREHENSION – PERCEPTION LEVEL
OF SITE CHARACTERISTICS

Comprehension and perception level of site
characteristics of Zeyrek Urban Conservation Study is
computed within four categories as general characteristics of
the site (location, size, boundaries and topography of the
site), conventional survey and analyses (building use, height,
material, condition analysis, built-up and inbuilt-up and
listed building), survey and analyses of townscape (analysis
of structural condition, visual quality, accessibility and
harmony) and proposal for the site (proposal for structural
size and mass, façade characteristics, accessibility and
architectural characteristics). Initially, it can be observed that
respondents who were presented 3D urban model gives fairly
higher scores to questions in the categories of general
characteristics of the site, survey and analyses of townscape.
On the contrary, first group who were presented 2D mapping
techniques have higher mean scores in the categories of
conventional survey and analyses and proposal for the site.

C. Participants
Forty-five graduate students, studying in Istanbul
Technical University, Faculty of Architecture (30 urban
planners, 8 architects, 7 landscape designer), took part in the
questionnaire. First group, twenty students (12 PhD and 8
master students) were asked to evaluate the 2D mapping
technique and the second group, twenty-five students (9 PhD
and 16 master students) were asked to evaluate 3D urban
model.

Note : All component loadings > 0.25 are reported. Highest loadings for every variable are
printed in bold. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy is 0,679. Significance level
within Bartlett's Test of Sphericity is 0,000.

As the result of factor analysis, components reflect the
same categories which were also identical in the
questionnaire form. Only the loading scores of building
height has been reported in another component terming
townscape characteristics (Comp. 1), because building height
analysis define the site more adequately in the second group
(3D urban model) as the townscape survey and analysis.
As the first group examines and interprets a presentation
with only 2D mapping techniques and the second group
examines and interprets other presentation with only 3D
urban model, a comparison has been assembled how much
difference exists between two visualization and
representation techniques in terms of delivering information
for urban conservation study to the respondents. LDA
processes each variables/questions and calculates values
indicating whether there is a statistically significant
difference.
As LDA analysis determines the mean values of each
component from factor analysis and from each test group
with the results of the F-test in the table n., Overall four
components, townscape characteristics (Comp. 1) and
general characteristics (Comp. 4) have positive mean values
in the second group but negative values in the first group.
However F-test significance indicates that statistically
significant mean difference in the same components.

Note: Question response format was seven-step scale from 1 to 7and highest mean values for each
variable are printed in bold (S.D.= standard deviation).

To investigate comprehension – perception level of
visualization and representation techniques, factor analysis is
also performed with varimax rotation of 17 variables and
developed indices for the whole data with the combination of
two groups. The question of “To what extent do you perceive
the location of the site?” (A1) has not been included in factor
analysis because it decreased the sampling adequacy and had
conflicts in the contribution of factor components in
expected scales.
A four-factor solution has been chosen for the variables
of comprehension – perception level of visualization and
representation techniques (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of
sampling adequacy: 0,679, Significance level within
Bartlett's Test of Sphericity: 0,000). 67,07% of cumulative
case loadings has been explained in component analysis with
1,201 Eigen value level. These levels reflect that factor
analysis is adequately representing the case loadings in the
sample size. These four factors could be termed as
respectively townscape characteristics (Comp. 1), proposal
characteristics (Comp. 2), conventional characteristics
(Comp. 3) and general characteristics of the site (Comp. 4).

The coefficients of each component reflect the preeminence in the discriminant function as Comp4 have
highest coefficient value as 1,064 and Comp3 has the lowest
one as – 0,498. Test of this function has been proved with
Chi Square test for Wilk’s lambda (Chi-square = 36,069 and
Significance = 0.000). This function indicates the similar
trends with dominant components as F-test results represent,
either. LDA gives possibility to estimate whether the group
cases classifies correctly in a classification table as follows:

TABLE IV.

Since the group mean values from second group in
component 1 and 4 are significantly (95% confidence
interval) positive and higher, it can be reported that 3D urban
model delivers more information on the components of
townscape and general characteristics of urban conservation
study. As the most distinctive component, general
characteristics (M: 0,469 in the second group and M: - 0,586
in the first group; Sig : 0,000) which refer to size, boundaries
and the topography of the site have been more intelligent to
deliver information by means of 3D urban model rather than
2D mapping techniques. This finding may refer to the ability
of visualization technique in terms of orientation sense of the
use. Other component townscape characteristics (M ; 0,359
in the second group and M: - 0,449 in the first group; Sig:
0,006) which refer to analysis of structural condition, visual
quality, accessibility, harmony and building height analysis
have also been more intelligent to define the conservation
site by means of 3D urban model.
Comp. 2 and Comp. 3 have higher mean values in the
first group but in 90% confidence interval, because these
components have significance level as respectively 0,064
and 0,100. It can be stated that to deliver information about
decisions and proposals about the conservation study and
conventional analysis such as building use, material,
condition, built-up and inbuilt-up analysis and listed building
analysis 2D mapping techniques are considerably adequate.
LDA calculates not only difference between group mean
values but also Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Function
(FLDF), which is used as a threshold for dividing the
answers into two groups at what extent these variable
correspond these identical difference. Test of this function
has been held by a chi square test for Wilk’s lambda, too.
The classification which is constructed by FLDF, is mainly
measured on the discriminant scores, and the scores
calculated with a linear equation. Classification for
comprehension – perception level of defined characteristics
in this case, which has been resulted with factor analysis
with a four-factor component analysis have been calculated
with the following equation;
D = 0,815⋅× Comp1 − 0,558⋅× Comp2
− 0,498⋅× Comp3 + 1,064 × Comp4

Note : 82,2% of original grouped cases correctly classified.

Classification table indicates number and percent of
respondents that belongs to correct groups. For instance,
discriminant score from 18 out of 20 respondents in the first
group could be grouped into first group. It means that only
two respondents’ answers in the first group had been more
likely close to the scores of the second group. But on the
contrary from 19 out of 25 respondents in the second group
could be grouped into the same group. As 82,2% of original
grouped cases correctly classified, it can be concluded that
there are significant differences in comprehension level of
defined characteristics of urban conservation study between
separate presentations as 2D mapping and 3D urban model
tools, and that the graduate students, who were presented 3D
urban model, have higher perception level of urban
conservation study’s defined characteristics than the ones
who were presented 2D mapping techniques.
IV.

CONCLUSIONS

As the fundamental finding of the study, it is concluded
that spatial attributes and characteristics in 3D urban models
are better defined by the comprehensive spatial analyses and
investigations than in 2D mapping technique. 3D urban
model has higher group mean values for most of the
variables but the most prominently for variables describing
“the comprehension of general characteristics” and
“cognition of townscape characteristics” of urban historic
site. In addition to the conclusion remarks of this paper, 3D
urban models with virtual reality applications also strengthen
the immersive experiences regarding the sense of orientation
in virtual urban environments [17].
In accordance with the responses from graduate students,
as one of the user groups among the planning and design
professions, the most important skill of 3D urban models is
stated as explanation ability of conservation project and

interventions to structural and visual quality of urban historic
environments. Representation ability of change and
enhancement of cognition and perception level in urban
historic townscapes are the other important capabilities of 3D
visualization techniques. Responses of graduate students also
overlapped with the community appraisals, especially for the
statement which considers the 3D urban models’ capabilities
on representing the sense of historic site affection [18].
These community appraisals were described by the help of
the research findings in 2009 [14] that main focus on the
representation capability of 3D urban model is related to
definition of architectural vernacular characteristics.
Graduate students in planning and design schools use 3D
urban model mostly as “last visualization media” which is
improved with material, texture and light modelling, in
enriched artistic and realistic details. But planning and
conservation project require visualization techniques in order
to describe and represent spatial content in details. In
conclusion, 3D models improve the user’s perception
regarding the representation of townscape characteristics and
enhance the communication and interaction of spatial
information among user groups in order to develop
collaborative processes in urban conservation.
