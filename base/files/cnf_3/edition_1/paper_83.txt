preservation of boundary valued problems using polynomial
spline interpolation. He defined arbitrary constraints for
shape preservation. Delbourgo and Gregory [4] obtained
the second order smoothness of strictly monotone data.
They used rational quadratic spline interpolation in this
regard. Duan et al. [5] discussed the accuracy of a rational
cubic interpolant, they applied Peano-Kernnel Theorem in
this regard. They discussed jump in the second derivatives.
Duan et al. [6] discussed the scheme for second order
smoothness of the rational interpolant, and discussed the
accuracy of this schme. They used two shape parameters to
control on the shape of the curve. Duan et al. [7] constructed
a weighted rational cubic spline. They used two kinds of
rational splines with second order smoothness. They applied
it to preserve the convexity of the data. Fangxun et al. [8]
developed a rational cubic function with quadratic
denominator and have also discussed error analysis of the
interpolant. Lamberti and Manni [10] constructed a shape
preserving C 2 functional interpolant. This interpolant is a
parametric cubic curve. They introduced tension parameters
to control the shape of the curve. They also discussed the
approximation order of the interpolant. Srafraz et al. [11]
introduced schemes for the modeling of positive data using
spline functions. The degree of smoothness they achieved is
C 1 . Sarfraz and Hussain [12] developed a C 1 piecewise
rational cubic function in which they have introduced two
shape parameters. They applied this scheme to preserve the
shape of the positive, monotone and convex data.
There always has been a need of advancements in the
methods developed earlier so that new techniques can be
utilized for more accurate results. Many authors have been
made their contribution for the advancement of such results.
This paper is also a contribution towards this progress. The
technique used in this paper has many salient features. The
rational cubic spline developed in this paper not only
visualizes the shaped data but also provides smoothness to
visual images. Rational cubic spline (2.1) as compared to
those defined in [7-10] has less computation. Additional
knots are not required as in [2], because this rational cubic
spline provides one or more than one free parameters which
provide the desirable control on the shape of the curve. No
arbitrary constraints are required as in [3] because of the
necessary and sufficient constraints developed for positivity,

Abstract- A rational cubic spline is developed to provide
smooth curves(positive, monotone and convex). To
control the shape of the curve, two families of
parameters are introduced in its representation. Three
schemes using rational cubic spline are elaborated to
obtain positive curves through positive data, monotone
curves through monotone data and convex curves
through convex data. As well as degree of smoothness
attained is C 2 .

INTRODUCTION

Interpolation is an essential part of scientific visualization
because it provides a foundation for the visualization of the
scientific data either in scientific research or in any
computer field, etc. It provides a way to understand the
inherited features of the data while other techniques fail to
do so. The curve representation of the data being
interpolated, gives a clear understanding of these hidden
features. Spline interpolation plays an important role in this
regard.
The technique used to interpolate the data must be
effective in a way that it provides smoothness to the curve
as well as has greater computational efficiency and
accuracy. Ordinary spline interpolation schemes do so but
do not provide control on the shape of the curve. Thus there
must be such schemes that can provide all the desired
features of the data.
In this paper such schemes are developed which not
only control the shape of the curve but also provide
smoothness in the representation of curves. When the data is
positive, monotone and convex, then developed schemes
produce positive, monotone and convex curves respectively.
This work is a motivation of the past work of many
authors. Brodlie and Butt [1] introduced an algorithm to
preserve convexity of the piecewise cubic interpolant. Butt
and Brodlie [2] developed an algorithm that not only
generates a cubic Hermite interpolant having first order
smoothness but also preserves the positivity of the
interpolant. To preserve the positivity of the interpolant,
they introduced a method of inserting one or two extra
knots, wherever required. Costantini [3] discussed the shape

where S    xi  and S    xi  denote derivatives w.r.t x and

monotonicity and convexity which automatically conserve
the shape of the data.
This paper is divided into six Sections. In Section 2, the
rational cubic spline is developed for visualization of curve
data. In Section 3 we derived constraints on shape
parameters to visualize positive data in the view of C 2
positive curve. In Section 4 we derived constraints on shape
parameters to visualize monotone data in the view of C 2
monotone curve. In Section 5 rational cubic spline is used to
visualize convex data in the view of C 2 convex curve.
Section 6 concludes the paper.

POSITIVE RATIONAL CUBIC SPLINE

In this section we will discuss the visualization of positive
data by rational cubic spline (2.1). Sufficient conditions will
be derived on shape parameters and derivative parameters
so that visualization of C 2 positive rational curve is
conserved.
Let us assume a positive data set: ( x0 , f 0 ), ( x1 , f1 ), ,
( xn , f n ), with x0  x1  x2  ...  xn , and f 0 ! 0, f1 ! 0, ,
f n ! 0. Since Qi (T ) is strictly positive for all Pi ,Q i ! 0,
i 0,1, 2,..., n  1, to discuss the positivity of S ( x ), it is
therefore enough to discuss the positivity of Pi (T ). Rewrite
Pi (T ) as follows:

here D i , Ei , J i and G i are as defined above.
It can be easily checked that when Pi 1 and Q i 1,
the rational cubic spline (2.1) becomes the standard cubic
Hermite polynomial. The desired shape of the curve can be
obtained if variations are made for the values of Pi ' s and
Q i ' s. The following section gives a brief description of this
phenomena.

Theorem 1. Rational cubic spline (2.1) visualizes positive
data in the view of C 2 positive curve if and only if either
shape parameters Pi , Q i satisfy (3.4) or (3.5). And
derivative parameters d i ' s used, are derived by (2.3) and
(3.6).
Remark 1. It is observed that the shape of the curve can be
preserved as well as can be controlled if the constraints (3.4)
are further modified. If there is no loss of generality, the
parameters ri , ti , satisfying ri , ti t 1, can be found. This
leads the constraints (3.4) to the following:

Remark 2. The values of the shape parameters Pi and Q i
satisfying (3.5) can be determined but this will take a lot of
computation work. Therefore, for practical results, the
choice of shape parameters in Remark 1, can be utilized.

This results in the following constraints:

To make the rational cubic spline smoother, second
derivative continuity is applied at each knot. The values of
derivative parameters are estimated by solving the system of
linear equations (2.3), this system involves n-1 linear
equations while the unknown values are n+1. So two more
equations are required for unique solution. For this we
imposed clamped end conditions at first and last knots such

CONVEX RATIONAL CUBIC SPLINE

In this section we briefly discuss the visualization of convex
data in the view of convex curves. It can be done if
appropriate values are assigned to shape parameters Pi and
Q i . This requires mathematical treatment so that the desired
shape of the curve is achieved. Assume the data set to be
strictly convex so that

Remark 1. It can be observed that if ' i  d i 0 or
di 1  ' i 0, then the curve will be linear in the region
where di di 1 ' i , i.e.
S ( x) f i (1  T )  f i 1T .
It can also be observed that if ' i 0, then both di and di 1
are necessarily equal to zero. This leads to the following:
S ( x) f i fi 1 ,
which is constant on [ xi , xi 1 ].
All the above discussion shows that the rational spline
(2.1) is convex together with the conditions (5.6) and (5.7).
In case when data is convex but not strictly convex, the
problem would be handled by dividing the data into strictly
convex parts.

CONCLUSION

A rational cubic spline is constructed for the visualization of
positive, monotone and convex data. To control the shape of
data two shape parameters are inserted in the description of
rational spline. Three main results are obtained for
visualization of positive, monotone and convex data. User
can easily control the shape of the curve according to his
needs just by changing the values of the free parameters
defined in the constraints for the shape parameters. To
provide maximum smoothness to the curves, the degree of
smoothness attained is C 2 .
The present paper work can be extended for surface
evolution as well. The authors are in progress of such a work
and have intended to complete it in the near future.

In Table 3 we considered a convex data. Figure 3 is
graphical view of this data using rational cubic spline (2.1).
Theorem 3 is applied for assigning the values of shape
parameters Pi , Q i and derivative parameters d i ' s. Figure 3
not only depicts the hidden behavior of the data but is
