most appropriate interaction and coordination
mechanisms in order to design adapted multiple views.
Since the increasingly growing success of simulation
tools based on 4D CAD (that associates a 3D view and a
temporal view), the issue of multiple views composition
and coordination becomes more and more important in
the construction sector.
The following work relies both on Information
Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction theories.
It proposes a method to compose and coordinate adapted
multiple views for users of 4D-based collaborative tools
in construction projects.

Abstract
The issue of multiple views coordination became
more and more challenging in the architecture,
engineering and construction (AEC) field since the
apparition and the increasing success of 4D/nD CAD. In
order to adapt visualization to user’s business
requirements in 4D-supported collaborative tools, this
paper propose a method to design coordinated multiple
views based on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE).The
method enables user’s visualization needs description,
visualization modes comparison. The aim is to choose
appropriate visualization modes business needs, to
associate interaction principles and coordination
mechanisms in order to compose coordinated multiple
views adapted to actor’s business needs. The paper
presents a case study based on literature review and
interviews with construction sector practitioners.

2. 4D multiple views issue in AEC sector
The concept “multiple views” in general describes
visualizations where multiple windows are used to
represent data [6]. So, “a multiple view system uses two
or more distinct views to support the investigation of a
single conceptual entity” [1]. Many current windowing
environments treat windows as independent and isolated,
and users have to manipulate individually one window at
a time, even when some contents or tasks are common
among the windows [7]. But we will use “coordinated
multiple views” when operations on the views are
coordinated [6]. In this case, the same or different
portions of the data can be displayed by windows and
these windows can be tightly coordinated in “a variety of
ways such that interacting with one component causes
meaningful effects in others” [2]. So, coordination
ensures that changes in one window are propagated to all
other views keeping the analyzed data consistent [8]. In
designing user interfaces, multiple window coordination
is more and more effective [9] and CMV strategies are
gradually more used in visualization and interfaces [7].
An important capability enhanced by coordination in
Information Visualization is about flexibility regarding
data; selection of a type of visualization mode for a given
set of data; and coordination characteristics definition
[8].
The Architecture, Engineering and Construction
(AEC) industry is characterized by “its loose
organization of the different participants that each
perform a specific role in a building project and have a

1. Introduction
Coordinated multiple views (CMV) are increasingly
used since their introduction and several studies have
been conducted to improve their use [1-4]. But in some
complex and highly collaborative fields like architecture,
engineering and construction (AEC), the use of CMV
deserves special attention. A major issue concerns the
adaptation of views to user’s business requirements in
such fields. Indeed, in the construction sector, each actor
usually has a specific role which follows from the
partner’s primary business field. It usually results in
specific views used for representing building-related
information [5]. Moreover, several representation modes
can represent the same concepts and actors choose one or
the other of these modes according to their specific needs
related to the tasks they have to achieve. Then, adapting
visualization to user’s business needs in collaborative
work supporting tools implies being able to choose the
best visualization modes and to associate to them the

as visual tool for contractors, subcontractors and
suppliers to discuss and to plan project progress. But in
the framework of this collaborative use, the adaptation of
4D multi-views to users’ business requirements remains
a challenging issue since the classical view (3D + Gantt)
usually proposed to all practitioners in most of the
current 4D tools seems not suiting the needs of every
actors and situations of use.
In the next section, we propose a method aiming at
designing adapted business multiple views for 4D
collaborative tools in AEC sector.

specific view on the building project data” [5]. So, if the
whole lifecycle of construction project can be covered by
computer visualization usage [10], it has to support the
highly collaborative aspect of the project. Indeed, in the
sector, each discipline has to process a large amount of
information related to the representation of a design
object between disciplines. And from a stage to another,
actors need to represent and share different kinds of
information with various levels of abstraction [11].
Moreover, as we said, in the AEC field, several
visualization modes can represent the same concept and
actors choose one or the other of these modes according
to their specific needs related to the task they have to
perform. Indeed, cooperation assistance tools have to
integrate interfaces that take into account the existence
and the specificity of “business-views”. “Business
views” are the visualization modes that practitioners use
in their daily work [12]. For example, tasks planning
may be represented by a Gantt chart or by a PERT
network and building elements can be depicted with a 3D
model or a 2D plan. So to support the collaborative
aspect of AEC projects, multiple views systems have to
be adapted to users’ business requirements and views
have to be chosen wisely.
With the rise of 4D CAD as a reference simulation
tool in the sector, the issue of coordination of multiple
views becomes more important. 4D CAD consists in
linking a 3D view of the building to a time view (works
planning) to simulate the building construction over the
time. Such visualizations respond to the four design rules
related to diversity, complementarity, parsimony, and
decomposition proposed by [1] about when to use
multiple views.
The use of 4D simulation tools has a real impact in
construction projects ([13]; [14]) and more recently, [15]
showed that the collaborative use of 4D CAD is
particularly useful during the pre-construction phase for
comparing the constructability of working methods, for
visually identifying conflicts and clashes (overlaps), and

3. Method to design adapted 4D coordinated
and multiple views
3.1. The method’s steps
We propose a multi-steps method to adapt
visualization to actor’s business needs in collaborative
work supporting tools.
• The first step identifies the business needs of
actors. This consists in formalizing the
collaborative practices in order to identify the
sub-practices performed by the different involved
actors. Knowing these sub-practices helps to
better define the business needs.
• In the framework of these collaborative practices,
actors use groupware to perform their business
activities. During these activities, we can identify
specific usages that we have to understand and
describe. The purpose of the second step is to
determine the visualization needs for each actor.
This step also highlights the actor’s interactions
and visualization tasks related to business
practices. At this stage we use the taxonomy
proposed by [16] to describe such visualization
tasks with a single and accurate formalism (Fig.
2).

•

After visualization needs known, it is then
possible to compare the possible visualization
modes in order to choose the most appropriate in
relation to the expressed needs. This is the subject
of the third step in which the visualization modes
are described and compared.
• When appropriate modes are selected for each
actor, one can select those that may be composed
together to form multiple coordinated views. To
this end, it is important to study the coordination
mechanisms and the interaction principles
associated with the visualization modes (fourth
step). At the end of this step, adapted business
views are composed for each actor.
These views will then be validated to ensure that the
propositions respond effectively to the expressed
business needs. Fig. 1 depicts the steps of the method.
Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach
recommends the use of metamodels to define domain
languages, so each model has to conform to its
metamodel. In order to model visualization modes and to
choose the most adapted ones, we propose to adapt and
use the business view metamodel described in [17].

The score (Nci) of a criterion i is then the sum of its
properties relevance (Pj) scores according to a
visualization requirement. The visualization requirement
is both an information need and a need for visualization
tasks. Nc may vary between -1 and 1.

3.5. Composing coordinated multiple views
Exploration techniques and coordination control are
two of the fundamental areas of coordinated and multiple
views [6]. The utility of multiple coordinated views
comes from users’ ability to express multidimensional
queries through simple forms of interaction [18]. To
compose coordinated views, we use the eight guidelines
proposed by [1] for the design of multiple view systems
and the 2x3 taxonomy of multiple window coordination
from [19]. Relied on these references and the state of the
art proposed by [6], we are working to propose a
metamodel of multi-views composition. This metamodel
will take into account notions related to multiple views
generation, exploration techniques, coordination and
control, human interface and usability and perception.

4. Case study

3.2. Formula for visualization modes ranking

We consider a case study related to site preparation
collaborative context and apply our method to a specific
collaborative practice: "Collaborative site scheduling".
The case study is established on the basis of literature
review and various interviews conducted. Indeed, we
interviewed six practitioners with different roles from
Luxembourg construction sector, in order to understand
their common activities in the pre-construction
framework and to better formalize the applied issue of
this work. In this realistic case study we assume that in a
given situation some actors are responsible for each of
the sub-practices shown on table 1.

We are working on a scoring system that would rank
visualization modes according to usage needs. By
assessing the criteria (technique, content, interaction
principle, visualization tasks, etc.) an adaptation score
(As) should be assigned to each visualization mode. This
score is calculated for each actor and each sub-practice
with the formula below. So, the relevance of a criterion
is related to the information needs and to the
visualization tasks.

4.1. Step 1: Identifying business needs
Subpractices

For the case study, we show in table 1 the result of
the first step. The sub-practices which will be performed
are known such as the associated responsible actors. The
information needs are also identified. We see that to list
building elements, the architect needs to visualize the
building representation and a pre-list of building
elements. The supervisor needs a work breakdown
structure (WBS) and a pre-list of construction activities,
to define activities and the activities planning to develop
the schedule. To estimate activities duration, subcontractors will need the description on these activities
while the contactor will have to visualize dates, activities
durations and a building representation to create the
activities sequences.

4.2. Step 2: Identifying visualization tasks

After this step, the exact information that actors
need to visualize and their visualization tasks are known.
For each information need, many visualization modes
may be possible. It is necessary to compare them in order
to choose the best adapted ones according to actor’s
visualization tasks.

After understanding the context of the CP, the
method’s step 2 aims at identifying the visualization
tasks the actors will have to perform. For this, subpractices are divided into elementary usages that will call
for specific visualization tasks. The visualization tasks
model will help us in this description as shown in table 2.
We see that to list building elements, as
visualization tasks, architect will need to visualize data,
locate items, and configure classifications. The activities
definition will lead to visualize data, locate items,
identify correlation and configure classification. To
estimate activities duration, sub-contractors have to
visualize data, configure filtering, determine means and
infer hypotheses. For activities sequencing, contractor
will visualize data, identify correlations and
dependencies, infer trends, configure classifications and
configure normalization. The schedule development
requires visualizing data, identifying correlations,
inferring trends and configuring classification.

4.3. Step 3: Choosing adapted visualization
modes
In this step, the business view metamodel (ref
section) is used to describe the possible visualization
modes for every expressed visualization need. In
instance, for the sub-practice “Activities sequencing”,
actor need to visualize the dates, the activities durations
and a building representation. The building
representation could be a 2D plan or a 3D representation
(Fig. 4). It is then necessary to describe these two
visualization modes in order to compare them.

4.4. Step 4: Composing adapted business multivisualization
After selecting adapted visualization modes, a 4D
tool designer would have to make sure that chosen views
are compatible. This is the aim of the step 4, and we are
still working on it. We will associate appropriate
exploration techniques and coordination mechanism
according to the needs of each actor. That will lead to a
relevant collaborative 4D tool with adapted human
interfaces. For example, within the case study, the
resulting multiple views could be a “3D+Gantt”
visualization for the architect, a “zoomed 3D+Gantt”
view with a focus on zoom for contractors and
subcontractors, and a “3D + Pert” view for supervisor.
We are still working to improve this step of the
method, in order to have better 4D multiple views
guidelines or patterns to support it.

Conclusions
The paper presents a method to design coordinated
multiple views for 4D-based collaborative tools in order
to adapt visualization to user’s business needs. The
metamodels that support the method are also presented
and a case study showed how to use these method and
models.
Future works will consolidate the method and a tool
will be developed to support it. Both the tool and the
method will be validated through confronting it to real
business situations.

Table 3: Visualization modes description
Using the adaptation score formula (table 4), we can
establish that 3D representation is better suiting this subpractice. The score in Table 4 are not validated yet and
future works will focus on it and, more generally, on
practitioner’s evaluation of business views according to
our criteria and their experience. Same work for each
other sub-practices will lead to know which visualization
modes are appropriate. So, for each actor, all
visualization modes needed to achieve his usage are
known.
