ABSTRACT
The work presented in this paper aimed to evaluate
the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) technology at
presenting architectural design during the client design
review stages of a construction project. A live project
from UK House Building Sector was adopted for the
evaluation. The work identified a suitable case study,
created a 3D model, formulated a presentation strategy
for the design review of the architectural design and
conducted a qualitative/quantitative evaluation of the
VR technology. The results showed VR technology to be
highly effective as a tool for presenting architectural
design; appropriately conveying the spatial dimension,
contextual information and realism of the architectural
design to the clients.

1. INTRODUCTION
The UK construction industry has been
characterised for its poor performance and inadequate
client briefing procedures, which has lead to high levels
of client dissatisfaction with the industry. The Client
Briefing Document produced for the construction
projects have been described as being inadequate, not
explicit and not detailed enough to communicate the
requirements of the construction project [5,9,10].
A considerable amount of research has been
conducted into Client Briefing to improve the whole
process with the development of numerous
methodologies and checklists [4,7,11,12]. Barrett and
Stanley [2] recommended five key improvement areas
for better briefing which are ‘Empowering the client’,
‘Managing the Project Dynamics’, ‘Appropriate user
involvement’, ‘Appropriate team building’ and
‘Appropriate
visualisation
techniques’;
these
improvement areas will be used as a metric for the work
undertaken.

The problem with a construction project is the
clients are buying a product that cannot be seen until it
is completed. Therefore, if the clients can be shown the
proposed design for a building using ‘Appropriate
visualisation techniques’, the clients are able to
comprehend the end product and confirm that it satisfies
their requirements [2,3,6], reducing the likelihood of
dissatisfaction with the end product.
Traditionally the client briefing process for the
presentation of proposed building designs are in the
form of 2D technical drawings, artist impressions or
animated walkthroughs. However, only a minority of
clients are able to read 2D technical drawings [2], whilst
the artist impressions are limited and do not aid the
clients visualisation of aspects in the architectural
design. The animated walkthroughs provide an
overview of the architectural design but do not allow
detailed inspection of the design. Aouad et. al. [1]
recommended the use of, Virtual Reality (VR) tools
during the early stages of the construction process [3,6],
as the key theme of these stages is 3D visualisation.

2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The aim of this work was to evaluate the
effectiveness of VR technology at presenting the
architectural design of a building and at facilitating the
client design review process. To fulfil the work criteria
a live project from the UK House Building Sector
formed the case study for the evaluation.

3. THE CASE STUDY
The case study was based on a construction project
initiated by Templar Housing Association. They wanted
to gauge the level of interest from potential tenants
(clients) regarding occupancy of a new apartment
complex commission. With the project in the conceptual
stage and the apartments not having been built, Templar
Housing needed to employ an alternative method to
present the development to their clients.

During the client design review process, clients
need to feel the 'experiential quality' [13], to be able to
fully understand the architectural design of the proposed
building. “Texture, form, colour, light, scale, movement
generally encompasses the qualities used by humans to
perceive and directly experience architectural space”
[13]. A tour of a building could provide the 'experiential
qualities', but this is impossible if the building does not
already exist. However, a computer generated
immersive model of the conceptual building can provide
most of the 'experiential qualities' offered by a physical
building [13]. Based on these principles, Templar
Housing commissioned a 3D model of the new
apartment complex.
The main objectives for the use of a 3D model in
the presentation of the new apartment complex, was to
involve the clients at the early design stages in order to
enable them to influence the design of their own living
environment. This was aimed at aiding their satisfaction
with the accommodation, thereby encouraging longer
occupancy in the apartments. An additional objective
was to determine whether commitment to occupy the
apartments could be obtained from the clients by the use
of 3D visualisation.

4.1. The 3D Model
The 3D model (Fig. 1 & Fig. 2) for the case study
was constructed in ReaLAX, a 3D Virtual Reality
modelling package, using information from 2D
architectural plan and elevation drawings, which were
used as templates textures within the ReaLAX
application to act as guides for building the model. The
3D model had a polygon count of over 120k producing
a file size of 5MB and used 107 different textures
requiring 13MB of hard drive memory. Optimisation of
the 3D model for improved frame rate performance
during presentation was achieved by using Levels of
Detail (LOD) were the interiors details of each
apartment were only rendered into the scene when they
were navigated into.
The 3D model formed a detailed representation of
the architectural design, consisting of interior details of
each apartment’s layout and furnishings. The interior
furniture was modelled using images from furnishing
catalogues, as the apartments were to be let fully
furnished. The exterior representation of the
development consisted of the apartment block and
external communal areas as well as the surrounding
terrain, giving the viewer of the 3D model visual cues as
to the locality of the development in relation to other
building in the area.
Interactions were programmed into the 3D model
to enable the demonstration of various design options,
these included, floor finishes (slate or carpet) and the
wall finishes (plain brick or plastered). There was also
an option to change the wall configuration in apartments
containing a combined kitchen and lounge. In addition
the 3D model gave the ability to change the style and
colour of the kitchen units and colour schemes could be
modified throughout the apartment. To add realism
doors were animated to open as the viewers were
navigated around the apartment.

4. METHODOLOGY
The methodology employed in the work
necessitated the identification of a suitable case study,
the creation of a 3D model, formulation of a
presentation strategy and a qualitative/quantitative
evaluation of the VR technology.

To generate interest for the case study, Templar
Housing advertised in a local newspaper for potential
tenants (clients) that would be interested in occupying
the apartments. The experimental group, for the work
presented in this paper comprised of nine people, six
clients and three representatives from Templar Housing.
The client design review process for the case study
comprised of two presentations, which were held a
week apart. The 3D model for the case study was
displayed in a Reality Room suite at the Centre for
Virtual Environments, University of Salford (Fig. 3); a
panoramic display device for collaborative visualisation

of 3D models. The Reality Room suite offers a 177˚x
46˚ field of view with a 3840 x 1024 pixel screen
resolution, using an SGI MIPS R10000, 250MHz,
4608MB processor and a InfiniteReality 2E graphics
pipe for rendering. The two stage presentation process
was used to familiarise the clients with the display
technology, before gaining understanding of the design.

•

Interactions - determine if the 3D model had
enough interaction features to demonstrate the
design option available to the clients.

The evaluation questionnaire was to be completed
by the experimental group after the second presentation
of the 3D model.

5. RESULTS
This section contains a summary of the issues
raised regarding the case study during discussions held
between the representatives of Templar Housing and the
clients at the design review presentations and the results
of the questionnaire completed after the second
presentation.
Fig. 3 – Reality Room Suite.
Both presentations started with a tour around the
exterior of the virtual building, showing car parking
facilities, communal areas, access points and security
features (Fig. 1). The tour continued into the building,
focusing on communal hallways and stairwells, with the
clients receiving a demonstration of the colour schemes,
floorings and wall finishes, available within the
communal areas. The clients were then guided into each
apartment within the development (Fig. 2) and shown
the colour schemes and style options available.
Throughout the presentations the clients were
encouraged to discuss the proposed architectural design
and voice their opinions.

4.3. Evaluation
A questionnaire was compiled in order to evaluate
the effectiveness of the 3D model for presenting the
architectural design. The questionnaire, questioned
specific aspects of the 3D model and its use in the
presented architectural design. Each of the questionnaire
sections had four questions related to it; allowing the
authors to have a wide range of comments to evaluate,
which in turn would give a more balanced evaluation
[8]. The questionnaire sections were as follows: • Scale / Spatial - evaluating the clients ability to
judge scale and spatial features from the 3D model.
• Cognition - determine the amount of design
information being internalised by the client during
the presented of the architectural design.
• Presence/Immersion - ascertain the level of
involvement the client felt with the 3D model.
• Richness of View - ascertain the level of realism
the 3D model portrayed to the clients.

5.1. Design Review
The clients were able to highlight designs aspects
that the architects had incorporated into the 3D model,
which did not meet their requirements: • External drying area - clients felt they would not
use these facilities and preferred a communal
seating area.
• Access gate at rear of the apartment complex initially modelled as a wooden gate (Fig. 4), which
the clients felt would not be secure and requested a
metal gate (Fig. 5) instead; this modification was
implemented for the second presentation by

replacing the texture of the wooden gate by a metal
gate texture.
Apartment windows overlooking wall - a ground
floor apartment that had views overlooking a
rendered wall. This was felt to be unsightly and a
proposal was made that climbing plants should be
planted against the wall. This feature was remodelled for the second presentation.
Communal entrance halls – architects designed the
hallway to display original features of the building,
i.e. slate floor and bare brick walls. However, the
clients felt that this made the building feel cold and
requested the hallways be carpeted with the walls
be plastered and painted.
Height of the boundary wall and fencing - clients
were concerned that if the fence which sat on top of
the boundary wall was to short in height, it may be
easily climbed to gain access into the complex, also

Scale/Spatial

the height of the boundary wall was highlighted as
being a potential point for gangs of youths to
congregate around the complex if it was a
comfortable height to lean or sit against.

Scale/Spatial – (Table 1) The majority of the
clients’ thought it was possible to gauge the height of
the rooms in the apartments and when asked to estimate
it, the mean response was 9 feet; the actual height being
8.33 feet. When questioned on what they thought was
the largest room, they all chose one of the two largest
rooms, either the bedroom or lounge/kitchen. The same
result pattern as the question on the largest room was
gained when asked about the smallest room, with
responses of either the storeroom or bathroom. The
results demonstrated that VR is a good media to portray
an overview of space.

Cognition – (Table 2) When clients were asked to
recall what item/appliance was situated under the
kitchen window eight out of nine participants correctly
answered the sink. However, when questioned on how
many doors led off the main corridor in an apartment,
the results were mixed. This was highlighted during the
presentation where participants felt disorientated whilst
in the corridor. The clients were also questioned on,
which rooms had more than one window; each correctly
identifying either the bedroom or the lounge, both of
which had more then one window. The clients were
questioned as to where the first door on the left in the

corridor led too. Two out of three clients said the
bedroom, which was correct. The responses to these
questions indicate that the contextual information
presented, via the 3D model, was easily internalised.
This was demonstrated when the client were asked to
recall features of the design, with the majority
answering the questions correctly.
Presence/Immersion – (Table 3) The clients were
asked if they could imagine living in the apartment, with
their own possessions in place, the majority of the
clients either agreed or strongly agreed with the
statements. When asked, after the presentation, if the
images were still vivid in their thoughts all either agreed
or strongly agreed. The final question for this area
asked how aware the clients were of events occurring in
the room, during the presentation, this was to gauge
their level of immersion. The results indicate the level
of immersion was low; this may be due to the lively
discussion during the presentations. The results obtained
indicate that the clients felt a high level of presence
when viewing the 3D model in the Reality Room;
however this must be contrasted with the low level of
apparent immersion suggested.
Richness of View – (Table 4) The results from the
richness of view section of the questionnaire indicated
the clients felt the 3D model contained enough visual
detail to be able to understand the architectural design
being presented.
Interaction – (Table 5) The results from the
interactions section of the questionnaire suggested that
the provision of limited interaction within the 3D
model, to change various design options and colour
schemes, aided the clients understand of the
architectural design and the design decisions.

6. DISCUSSIONS
From the results of questionnaire and observations
during the client design review process, it can be
established that four of the five key improvement areas
for client briefing [2] were met, by using VR as a tool
for presenting architectural design: • ‘Appropriate visualisation techniques’ – the
visualisation technology used to present the
architectural design appeared to aid the clients
understanding of the case study.
• ‘Empowering the client’ – The clients felt
empowered to make design decisions.
• ‘Managing the Project Dynamics’ – the design
issues highlighted during the first presentation,
were re-modelled in the 3D model for the second
presentation.

•

‘Appropriate user involvement’ – the clients were
involved in the design review as they would be the
people occupying the apartments.

The final outcome of the case study was that the
clients have shown commitment to the apartment
complex presented, by stating which apartment they
would want to occupy and choosing the style of the
kitchen units and the colour schemes they wanted within
their apartment. From this high level of commitment it
would appear that the key objectives, defined for the
case study, have been addressed.

7. CONCLUSIONS
This paper describes an investigation into the
application of Virtual Reality technology for improving
the visualization and communication quality of the
client design review process for a construction project.
From this investigation the following conclusions have
been drawn.
The use of an appropriate visualisation tool during
the client design review process allows the clients to
understand the architectural design and confirm that the
product meets their requirements.
The client design review conducted for the case
study showed that use of VR technology greatly
enhanced the clients understanding of the architectural
design. The clients were able to discuss features of the
architectural design and articulate amendments to the
design, which met their requirements.
The qualitative and quantitative results showed that
3D visualisation of the building model provided the
clients with the 'experiential qualities' needed to
perceive and directly experience architectural space,
conveying the spatial dimension, contextual information
and realism of the architectural design with significant
accuracy.
The work presented in this paper can conclude that
VR technology has potential for improving the client
design review process within the construction industry,
by enhancing the communication within visual
presentation of architectural design, between designers
and clients.

8. FURTHER WORK
Due to the nature of the case study used the size of
the experimental group was limited by their relevance to
the project. To further validate the work presented in
this paper, a more comprehensive evaluation would
need to be undertaken. This evaluation would require a
larger experimental and control group, for comparing
different presentation techniques for a range of

architectural property types, to demonstrate that Virtual
Reality is an effective tool for presenting the
architectural design.
Also a comparison of VR display technologies (i.e.
CAVE, Reality Room, Immersive Workbench) needs to
be undertaken to determine which best affords the
'experiential quality' required to understand architectural
design and facilitate the client design review process.
