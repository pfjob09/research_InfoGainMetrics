Abstract

problem based on visualisation of abstract representations
of audio data. The key idea in the approach is to store
digitised audio data and postpone any transcription or
replay of the data until it is absolutely required. Instead,
the analyst interacts with an abstract representation of the
sequential audio data through a graphical user interface
that supports navigation based on speech patterns or
annotated keywords and provides random access to any
audio sequence of interest. A similar approach underlies
the multimedia analysis tool DIVA [8] that includes representations of multiple synchronised multimedia streams
accessible through a graphical user interface.
This paper combines an abstract representation of
communication with an exploratory visualisation interface. Communication is recorded as digitised audio data
or as electronic messages, and each message exchange is
represented as an abstract link with information about
sender, receiver, time point, duration, and classification
[16]. Visualisation and exploration take place at the level
of abstract links. The problem of formulating—or even
knowing—relevant questions suggests that queries should
be dynamic in the sense that the results of interactions are
immediately visible [13]. Obtaining zero hits or too many
hits when searching and browsing large data sets is
another well-known problem [15]. As communication
analysis includes exploratory tasks, we need a clear view
of the context to navigate among the data. Providing
dynamic queries alone does not solve this problem. We
also need hints on where and how to adjust the queries to
manage the hits [14]. These requirements prompted us to
base our tool for communication analysis on the Attribute
Explorer [15, 14].
Using authentic data from a military training exercise
and a rescue operation exercise we show how the
extended Attribute Explorer helps answering ubiquitous
C2 questions, such as what an actor said to another actor
in a specified time interval. But more important, we demonstrate how the visualisation supports discovering unanticipated communication patterns and helps detecting
anomalies in the underlying link data [18]. The software

Communication is a central activity in command and
control. However, analysing communication using linear
transcription of large amounts of sequential data is
tedious and time consuming. This paper describes an
alternative approach to communication analysis based on
visual exploration of abstract representations of communication. It introduces a visualisation technique based on
the Attribute Explorer. The technique was implemented in
a visualisation component embedded in a framework for
coordinated presentation of temporal data. It is demonstrated using authentic communication data from a
military exercise and a rescue operation.

1. Introduction
Communication is crucial in distributed, safety-critical
human activities, such as fire fighting, law enforcement,
and military operations, where units operate at separate
locations under hazardous conditions to achieve common
goals. Commanders, team leaders, and specialists must
exchange plans, procedures, reports, and orders to coordinate and synchronise their efforts. Not only are such
messages vital to ensure a successful outcome of an
operation, but they also provide an observable trace of
how key actors have perceived the emerging situation and
what decisions they have made. Therefore, recording and
analysing communication from multiple channels are
important means of gaining insight into the processes
involved in command and control (C2).
A major problem with communication analysis and
other process-tracing methods [19] is that they can
generate huge amounts of data. Another problem is that
analysis of audio data based on transcription is timeconsuming and tedious [3]. Fisher and Sanderson [6]
observed that the time required to analyse a recorded
sequence could be many times longer than the sequence
itself. But they also indicated a potential solution to the

tool was implemented as a plug-in component for the
MIND visualisation framework [10, 9].
The next section briefly introduces C2 and describes
the role of communication in C2. Then follows a short
description of the MIND visualisation framework. After
those preliminaries we review the Attribute Explorer and
describe how our extension facilitates the analysis of
communication in C2. A discussion and our conclusions
complete the paper.

2. Communication in command and control
Pigeau and McCann [11] provided a general definition
of C2 that focuses on its role in a distributed activity:
“The establishment of common intent to achieve coordinated action” (p. 165). They further distinguished
between intent that is publicly communicated (explicit
intent) and intent that is assumed from the cultural,
organisational, and individual context (implicit intent).
Shattuck and Woods [12] linked this definition of C2 to
the role of a communication process as a conveyor of
plans, procedures, specifications of degree of control, and
reports on system status between supervisors and actors in
a hierarchical, distributed organisation. In particular they
discussed the inherent conflict between maximising a
supervisor’s degree of control and enabling local actors to
respond to rapid changes in the environment. Flin [5]
reported that not having a complete picture of an
emerging situation was a major source of stress for fire
commanders. In essence, this issue concerns what must be
communicated, before and during a mission, and what can
be managed at a local level guided by what has been
communicated and what can be inferred from the context.
To analyse communication in C2 we thus need to consider both the messages sent between various actors and
the situation in which they were sent. Examples of
important issues in the operational context are:
 Actors: What individuals and teams are involved
and what is their status?
 Organisation: How are individuals and teams
organised in units and how is the chain of command defined?
 Communication: What means of communication
exist and how does the communication structure
relate to the chain of command?
 Tasks: What tasks have actors been assigned?
 Location: Where are the actors?
 Activity: What are the actors doing?
 Coordination: What activities need to be coordinated to ensure effective, efficient, and safe
operations?
 Time: Are there deadlines and when do activities
have to commence and cease?

Artefacts: What is the status of communication
systems and other tools for C2 and how are they
used?
 Environment: What does the terrain look like and
what is the weather like?
Although communication analysis can provide crucial
information pertaining to those issues, other means of
process data are required as well, for example log files
from C2 systems, log files from positioning devices, and
video recordings from command posts [16]. Compiling
process data and combining them with verbal reports provided by participants enable the construction of behavioural protocols [19] to address cognitive aspects of
communication in C2.

3. The MIND visualisation framework
The need to handle large amounts of data pertaining to
diverse aspects of command and control in distributed
operations motivated our development of the MIND visualisation framework [10, 9]. MIND uses data collected in a
real operation to construct a time-synchronised, discreteevent representation of the course of events of the operation. The resulting model can be presented in a visualisation tool that supports time-based navigation and
animation using multiple views. MIND includes a component model that enables the development and deployment
of customised models and visualisations to meet the
requirements of different domains, research questions,
and target audiences. Examples of visualisation views
deployed with MIND are:
 Map view: Presents the time-dependent location
of actors using symbols in customisable maps
 Photograph view: Displays time-stamped and
annotated digital photographs of actors at work
 Video view: Displays time-stamped video
sequences of activities in the operation
 Audio sequence view: Provides random access to
time-stamped audio data from various communication networks
 Communication link view: Presents audio data
represented both as communication links and
audio sequences
 Dynamic timeline: Shows an overview of
selected events to support temporal navigation
 Document view: Displays written information,
for example plans, standard operating procedures,
and orders
So far, MIND has been used to support training and
evaluation in the military domain [7, 1] and in the public
safety sector [10, 4]. It has also been used to support
research on airborne mine detection in Croatia.

4. Exploring the Attribute Explorer
The Attribute Explorer [15] is an interactive visualisation tool that employs the concept of linked histograms. It
provides one histogram for each dimension (or attribute)
of the data, where the height of each bar corresponds to
the number of data elements that fall under that interval.
By changing the limits in one dimension the corresponding hits are updated (or ‘brushed’) in the other dimensions. Elements filled in a contrasting colour represent
full hits, that is, they satisfy all constraints in all dimensions. Shades of grey—from black to white—represent
the number of dimensions failed. An element is coloured
black if it fails in one dimension only and white if it fails
in all. For each dimension added to the data set, there is
an additional constraint that can be violated. Thus the
number of colours required equals the number of dimensions of the data.
The Attribute Explorer supports central tasks in visual
exploration of communication by meeting the following
three requirements:
 The need to answer known questions: It accepts
well-defined, absolute restrictions on each dimension, which subsumes pre-defined queries.
 The need for exploration: It encourages exploration by enabling dynamic interaction with every
dimension and presenting immediate visual feedback.
 The need for context: It provides a view of the
context at all times as the colour-coded histograms
give hints on where to relax constraints to get hits
and where to impose restrictions to narrow the
solution space.

Start time: The time when the communication
was initiated
 Total length: The total length of the communication sequence
In addition, a link may have an optional text annotation that includes a key word or a short summary. These
attributes cover several of the operational issues listed in
Section 2.
Creating links requires extraction of senders and
receivers, and classification of message contents. For
computer-based communication, for example e-mail,
links can be generated semi-automatically using logging
tools. However, to process recorded audio data substantial
manual work is required.
Spence and Tweedie [15] discussed both ordinal and
categorical attributes, but all the application examples
presented concerned data sets with numerical attributes
[14]. In our case the attributes are of different types—
categorical, hierarchical, ordinal—and they may be both
discrete and continuous. For such attributes, range-based
selection is not sufficient. Instead, a user must be able to
select and deselect elements independently. Furthermore,
some of the attributes of a communication link need not
have mutually exclusive ranges of values. Communication links may specify several receivers for one message,
which forces the same underlying data to be represented
at several places in the histogram. Similarly, a communication link may include multiple message classifications.
Another characteristic is the temporal dimension of the
data set: Communication is distributed over time and will
therefore add an underlying source of dynamism into the
exploration.

5. Extending the Attribute Explorer
Before we can explore communication visually using
the extended Attribute Explorer we need to convert the
data recorded to an abstract representation. A commonly
used method for evaluation of communication is link
analysis, which accounts for frequencies of interactions
between humans, machines or their combinations [2].
Extended Link Analysis [16, 1] extends basic link analysis to address communication in C2 by adding time
stamps and message classifications to links. The communication links constructed include the following attributes:
 Sender: The actor in a communication network
that initiated the communication
 Receiver(s): The actor(s) in a communication network to whom the message was addressed
 Classification: A hierarchical set of categories,
allowing both detailed classifications and summary classifications

To demonstrate the benefits of using the extended
Attribute Explorer, we examine radio communication
from two field exercises. In the first exercise a joint multiagency rescue force responded to a mass-casualty underground train derailment in Stockholm [17]. The other
exercise involved manoeuvre warfare with a mechanised
battalion in northern Sweden.
First, we demonstrate how the Attribute Explorer helps
us find the answers to predefined queries. One example of
such a query is to ask for all communication sequences
initiated by a particular actor. In the Attribute Explorer
there is a straightforward way of conducting this nonexploratory task by imposing restrictions on the attributes
of the data set. Figure 1 illustrates this use where one staff
member (police unit 9770) has been selected in the
‘sender dimension’ leaving all other dimensions minimised. The hits represent every sequence initiated by unit
9770 and they are listed below the histogram. From this
list, it is possible to replay the audio message of selected

communication links and to synchronise the other views
in the MIND visualisation framework with the links. The
time stamp of the selected communication link is used as
the target time point for temporal navigation in the
framework. The contents of the views are updated to
reflect the state at that time. Figure 2 depicts a map view
of the incident area showing the current state of all
involved units at the point of time derived from such an
interaction with the Attribute Explorer.
In exploratory tasks, for example when studying
movements and activities of military units, an analyst may
seek to answer why a unit suddenly interrupted its activities or turned and headed for another direction. Figure 3
illustrates such an example that involves the military unit
DX. Selecting the unit in focus (DX) as receiver,
choosing the classification category ‘order’ (which
includes three different subcategories: preliminary order,
short order, and full order), and specifying a time span
covering the last hour, produce a view where the hits
correspond to all orders given to the unit in the specified
time frame. Replaying these orders (or maybe just by
looking at their textual annotations) may reveal the reason
for the unit’s behaviour.
In both these examples queries formulated in a data
base language could have produced the same end result.
But we would not have been invited to notice the additional contextual information. For example, we see in
Figure 3 that DX never received a full order, neither in
nor outside the selected time interval. We conclude this
from the fact that the ‘full order’ classification elements
are coloured grey, which means that they violate
constraints in more than one dimension. However, we
notice that DX did receive orders some hours before (the

Figure 1. An example of a simple query using only one
dimension, sender (sändare), of the Attribute Explorer:
Police unit 9770 is selected in the sender dimension and
all communication initiated by 9770 is shown in the list.

units (police and fire department vehicles, ambulances
etc.) on a photographic map of the incident area.
black elements in the time dimension area). Furthermore,
we see that DX did not receive any other types of messages during the selected hour, because all elements in
unselected classification categories fail in at least one
other dimension (see Figure 3).
Exploring a scenario in the Attribute Explorer may
result in the discovery of relevant facts without any pronounced question to begin with. For example, when we
examine the messages sent from the battalion staff to the
subordinate companies in the battalion exercise, we find a
period of nearly two hours where no communication was
initiated. Figure 4 shows a view where a time interval
including that period has been selected. The first hit in the
selection represents an order that instructed the company
TJ to carry out their task. Presuming that TJ conducted
that task, the next step is to inspect communication initiated by TJ during this activity. By limiting the sender
dimension to only include TJ, by restricting the receiver
dimension to include only the supervisors of TJ in the
battalion staff, and by selecting the classification dimension to ‘reports’, we see how TJ continuously reported its
progress (see Figure 5). The reports are immediately
accessible in the list of hits (as in Figure 1), allowing the
original communication to be reviewed and replayed. The
example view in Figure 5 gives other hints as well: TJ did
not report to anyone else than its supervisors (no black
elements outside the limits). Moreover, TJ reported
enemy status (as indicated by the small black element to
the right). By looking at the length dimension as well
(minimised in the figure) we discover that all reports were

short, except for one that was considerably longer.
Selecting that link leads us to a concluding summary
report of the company’s progress. These examples demonstrate the exploratory use of the visualisation tool for
analysing communication.
What about finding problems in the underlying data?
Using the length dimension to select unusually short messages from the military exercise, we find that they typically are flawed in some way (e.g. lost connections and
poor audio quality) and usually classified as ‘other’.
Adding a classification for incomplete transmissions
would make it possible to relate communication problems
to other aspects of an operation. Furthermore, it is easy to
detect communication links pertaining to orders that (by
mistakes in the link analysis) point in the wrong direction.
If a commander receives an order from a subordinate unit
there will be an isolated green element in the explorer
view that stands out. Once spotted, the corresponding
communication link can be adjusted to convey the correct
information.

Figure 3. This view shows the use of three dimensions,
receiver (mottagare), classification (klassning) and time
(tid), to find the most recent orders given to military unit
DX. The selection in the classification dimension comprises order (order), preliminary (förberedande) order,
short (kort) order and full (lång) order.

Figure 4. This view shows received messages for the
company TJ during a period of time. The first message is a
direct order and leads us to look closer on how TJ will
carry out this order.

Figure 5. By selecting appropriate limits on the sender
(sändare), receiver (mottagare), classification (klassning),
and time (tid) dimension we see how the company TJ
regularly reports to its supervising officers.

7. Conclusion and future work
Our goal was to develop a tool that can support the
analysis of communication in command and control. In
the short time the prototype has been available for C2
system analysts within the MIND research group, it has
already been welcomed as a helpful tool not only to
answer ubiquitous questions pertaining to communication
in C2, but also to explore patterns and relations in communication data. The combination of link analysis and a
visual representation based on the principles of the
Attribute Explorer provides new possibilities for explorative communication data analysis in the C2 domain.
These possibilities fill gaps in the MIND framework–a
research tool under constant development–and shed light
on further development issues for the framework as a
whole, where more powerful coordination possibilities
among different views is one example.
More research is needed in the area to evaluate the
usefulness of the technique. However, formal evaluations
of the Attribute Explorer in order to compare it to other
techniques could be hard to get ecologically relevant. The
exploratory nature of the Attribute Explorer and the
complex nature of communication and C2 make this task
non-trivial. However, to get an improved understanding
of the usefulness, the implemented tool will be delivered
to and used by analysts outside the MIND research group
as well, contributing to a deeper insight.
