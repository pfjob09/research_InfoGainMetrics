Abstract
In the initial process of exterior design of a product,
designers often get the idea of a designing product form as
silhouette lines and boundary lines. Therefore, if the 3-D
model is constructed from silhouette lines and boundary
lines, designers will be significantly assisted in the process
of external form design. This paper describes a system to
construct a 3-D model with complex curved surfaces from
silhouette and boundary lines.
The silhouette and
boundary lines can be easily given by a computer mouse or
a tablet and are then approximated by cubic Bezier curves
linked with curvature continuity at the connected points.
A Bezier surface is defined from the four lines as the
silhouette or the boundary by an originally developed
algorithm. The 3-D model is then constructed by Bezier
surfaces with curvature continuity on the connecting lines.
Since the system does not obstruct designer’s thinking due
to simple operations of the system, designers can elaborate
and confirm the idea by considering and examining the
form indicated by the system.

1. Introduction
Not only the functions but also the external form is
becoming the important factors when a customer selects
and buys an industrial product. External form design:
style design, is creative activity depending on designer’s
sensibility. Many computer-aided design (CAD) systems
have been developed for modeling the form satisfying
functions of a product and they have served to increase
design efficiency. However, there are very few systems
for supporting design of the external form of a product
because the current CAD systems hinder a designer in
getting an idea of an external form due to the complicated
operations.
In initial design process of the external form of a
product, designers embody it from the image and concept
of the targeted product by silhouette and boundary lines.
Therefore, if a 3-D model is directly and easily constructed
from such lines and the designed form can be examined
and evaluated, much support is given for design activity of

external form of a product.
In this paper, in order to support design process of the
external form of automobiles, an algorithm is proposed to
easily construct a 3-D model by the silhouette lines and
boundary lines given by designer’s handwriting. And the
effectiveness of a system implemented according to the
proposed algorithm is examined.

2. Outline of developed system
2.1.

Silhouette lines representing form feature of
automobile

The objective of this study is to develop a system to
construct the 3-D model of an automobile from the
silhouette lines and boundary lines. Figure 1 shows the
silhouette lines in the side view of an automobile: the base
line, shoulder line, roof line, front window line, rear
window line, face line, and tail line. The lines directly
and obviously represent form features of an automobile.
Form expression of an automobile such as speediness,
stability, prettiness, massiveness, deluxe, and so on is
typically determined by the silhouette lines. All types of
automobiles can be expresses by combining the silhouette
lines.

and another model is then re-formed. The processes are
repeated until a designer obtains a satisfactory form. In
the process, the model can be evaluated with different
colors, different scenes, and different types of light source.
Since the modeling processes are executed by very simple
operations, the developed system does not hinder designers
in creating and embodying idea.

model form
The silhouette and boundary lines can be inputted into
the developed system by handwriting with a mouse or a
tablet. The developed system constructs the 3-D model of
an automobile from the silhouette lines and boundary lines
in the views from the four directions as shown in Fig. 2.
The constructed model is presented to the designer and is
evaluated with the views from various directions. If the
presented form does not satisfy designer’s sensibility, the
silhouette and boundary lines are modified by re-inputting

Input and definition of silhouette and
boundary lines

The silhouette and boundary lines shown with lines in
Fig. 4 are defined by making approximations with cubic
Bézier equations from discrete point data shown with white
circles in Fig. 4 inputted by a mouse and a tablet. The
approximated Bézier curves are evaluated by the locus of
the center of curvature as shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a)
shows the locus of the center of curvature of the cubic
Bézier curve directly approximated from the inputted data.
And the cubic Bézier curve is modified according to the
evaluation of the curvature locus. Figure 5(b) shows the
modified Bézier curve and its locus of the center of
curvature.
The intersections shown with black circles in Fig. 4
between the approximated Bézier equations are then
derived. The approximated cubic Bézier curves are
fragmented with the intersections and the control points to
define each fragmented cubic Bézier curves are derived.
The derived control points of the fragmented Bézier curves
are shown with triangles in Fig. 4. Thus, a Bézier curve
defined by two intersections and two control points shown
with the black circles and triangles in Fig. 4, respectively,
plays a role as a boundary line to define a basic surface.

3.2. Model construction by basic surfaces
The following is the procedures to define basic surfaces
of a model. Figure 6 shows the four Bézier curves to
restrict the boundary form of a surface. Each Bézier
curve is defined by the four control points shown with the
circles in Fig. 6 that are derived by the procedure
mentioned in section 3.1. When a basic surface is defined
by a cubic Bézier equation, another four control points P11,
P12, P21, and P22 shown with triangles in Fig. 6 are needed
for the twelve control points P00, P01, P02, P03, P10, P13, P20,
P23, P30,, P31, P32, and P33. The four control points P11, P12,
P21, and P22 are derived by the Eqs. (1) ans (2).

introduced element points.
And u and v are the

the twelve control points defining the boundary lines and
the position vectors of the four control points P11, P12, P21,
and P22 derived by Eqs. (1) and (2) as a cubic Bézier
surface by Eqs. (3) and (4).

When the silhouette and boundary lines shown in Fig. 2
are given, the basic surfaces are determined according to
the procedure mentioned above and the constructed model
is shown in Fig. 8.

Construction of smooth surfaces between
basic surfaces

As shown in Fig. 8, the basic surfaces defined from the
silhouette and boundary lines are connected with only
position continuity at the joined lines. In the next process,
the developed system makes surfaces connecting the basic
surfaces with curvature continuity.
The borders of the basic surfaces are cut as shown in

Figure 10. Constructed 3-D model

Fig. 9(a). The cut widths of the borders and the curvature
of the connecting surface are determined by the required
roundness at the joined lines of the basic surfaces. New

surfaces are then constructed at the opening area between
the basic surfaces by using the original surface equation [1],
[2] as shown in Fig. 9(b). The original surfaces can easily
make smooth connection: curvature continuity, between the
basic surfaces. Figure 10 shows an example of a
constructed 3-D model.

(5) New surfaces are constructed at the border area of the
basic surfaces and make smooth connection between
the basic surfaces.
(6) The developed system can easily construct a 3-D
model and can examine the form with various view
directions, colors and scenes.
