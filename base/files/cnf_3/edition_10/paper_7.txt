The points are called control points of γ, and the polygon

In computer-aided geometric design the functions u0 , . . . , un
n
are usually nonnegative and i=0 ui (t) = 1 ∀ t ∈ [a, b] (i.e.
the system (u0 , . . . , un ) is normalized) and in this case we
say that (u0 , . . . , un ) is a blending system. The convex hull
property is an important property for curve design: for any
control polygon, the curve always lies in the convex hull of

Let us observe that for m = 2 the previous system coincides with Bernstein basis on [0, 1]. In section 2 we prove
that the previous system is blending, so that it is adequate for
design purposes.
One of the simplest shape properties is monotonicity
(see [2], [3], [7] and [10] -[16]). In this paper we analyze the
monotonicity preservation of the previous system (proving in
Section 2 that is monotonicity preserving for all m ≥ 2) and

of the Wang-Ball system (proving in Section 3 that is monotonicity preserving for all 2 ≤ m ≤ 10).
Deﬁnition 1.2. A system of functions (u0 , . . . , un )
is monotonicity preserving if for any α0 ≤ α1 ≤ · · · ≤ αn
n
in R, the function i=0 αi ui is increasing.
Let us interpret monotonicity preservation in terms of
parametric curves. Let us project the control points and the
curve onto a line l = {Q + αv|α ∈ R}; let Pˆi = Q + αi v
be the projection of Pi , i = 0, . . . , n, and γˆ (t) = Q + α(t)v
the projection of γ(t) onto l. If (u0 , . . . , un ) is a monotonicity preserving system, then the following property holds: the
projected points γˆ (t) are ordered, i.e. α(t) is an increasing
function, provided that the projected points Pˆ0 , . . . , Pˆn are
ordered, i.e. α0 ≤ α1 ≤ · · · ≤ αn .
The following characterization of monotonicity preserving systems was obtained in Proposition 2.3. (i) of [2].

Finally, applying Lemma 1.3 to both cases, the result
holds.

(aj0 , . . . , ajj ), j = 2, . . . , m, are monotonicity preserving.
Proof. Let us prove it by induction on j ∈ {2, . . . , m}.
For j = 2, we obtain in fact the basis (c20 , c21 , c22 ) of Theorem
2.3 which is monotonicity preserving as we have seen in its
proof.
Let us now assume that the result holds for j − 1 (3 ≤
j ≤ m), and let us prove it for j. Since the Wang-Ball system
is blending v0j = 1 is a constant function for all j. We now
distinguish two cases:
