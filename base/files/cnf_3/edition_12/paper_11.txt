Introduction
arid

This paper describes a parametric C2 rational spline
with interval and point tension weights. T h e spline
can he considered as a n alternative to tlie cubic vspline and B-spline formulations of [l]arid [4]. T h e
rational spline also provides a C2 alternative t o the
C1 weighted v-spline of Foley[2], since the interval
and point tension weights have a remarkably similar
influence on the curve t o those of t h e weighted Y spline.
Tlie rational spline, discussed here is a generalization of the interval tension method introduced in [3].
However, the appropriate generalization of this interval tension method is riot immediately clear. T h e use
of a general rational form gives a n over abundance
of conflicting parameters which can lead to poorly
parameterized curves. The solution adopted here is
t o restrict the class of rational cubic representations
t o those having quadratic denominators. This leads
t o representations having sensible parameterizations
with well defined and well behaved interval and point
tension weights. T h e use of this restricted class of
rational splines has the added advantage t h a t conic
segments can easily be accommodated within the representation.

For simplicity, we assume positive weights

and have made use of a rational BcrnsteinBezier representation, where the control points
{F,, V,, W,, $',+I} are determined by imposing the
the Hermite interpolation conditions:
p ( t z )= F,, and p ( ' ) ( t , ) = D,, i E 2.
T h e scalar weights in the numerator of equation(3)
are those given by degree raising the denominator
t o cubic form. Since the denominator is positive, it
follows from Bernstein-Bezier theory t h a t the curve
segment p [ t , , t , + llies
~ in the convex hull of the control
points {FZ,V,, W,, F z + l } and is variation diminishing with respect t o the control polygon joining these

points. It should also be observed t h a t the weights
are not independent and that one could take yi a constant for all i E 2 without loss of generality. However, we find it useful to consider the three scalar
weights Xi, p i , and y;on [ti,t ; + l ) in the development
of the theory. For the practical implementation we
will write
(Y;

= 1 / X i and

pi

= 1/pi

(5)

This leads to a consistent behavior with respect t o
increasing weights and avoids numerical problems associated with evaluation at I ) = 0 and I ) = 1 in the
(removable) singular cases a i = 0 and pi = 0. We
now have

T h e case A; = pi = 1 and y; = 2 is t h a t of cubic Hermite interpolation. One thus has a point
tension parameter Xi controlling the curve in the
neighbourhood of ti and a n interval tension parameter y; controlling t h e curve on the interval

The Local Support Basis

We now describe a local support basis representation
for the space of C 2 rational cubic splines on the knot
partition ( ti E R, i E 2 ). Assume t h a t there exists
a local support basis ( B j ( t ) ) j e z , where

Following the approach of Boehm [7], the curve

demonstrate the existence of the local support basis.
The transformation also provides a convenient tool

The behavior described above is confirmed by the example curves of Figure 2. The curve of Figure 2(a)
shows the effect of increasing both point and interval
tension weight, whereas Figure 2( b) shows the effect
of increasing two interval tension weights. The curve
of Figure 2 ( c ) shows the effect of increasing an interval tension weight.

Equations( 16) and (17) define the transformation

Interpolatory Spline with Interval and Point Tension

In interpolatory spline we are given a set of d a t a
points F,,, F l , ....,Fn, and we require a cubic Bspline curve p determined by unknown control vertices P-1, Po, ...., Pn+l, such that p ( t , ) = F, in other
words, p interpolates t o the d a t a points. The process
of obtaining the interpolatory rational cubic B-spline
with interval shape control is accomplished through

the transformation generates the rational BernsteinBezier representation of the basis function. The condiit^lon

system is underdefined and for a unique solution we
need t o specify two further conditions, one at the
start and one at t h e end of t h e curve. We shall repeat the two end control points, although it is not
the only end condition available. The above system
of equations is tridiagonal- only t h e diagonal elements
and t h e two neighbors are nonzero. By exploiting t h e
structure of t h e tridiagonal matrix we can solve the
resulting system of equations more efficiently and bypass t h e standard elimination techniques.

That is the control vertices of the curve which passes
through the given data points Fi's are given by the Pi's
as in equation(25). When these values of Pi's are substituted in equation(20), we get the required C 2 continuous
interpolatory B-spline curve with point and interval tension.

4.1 Examples
The shape behavior of the interpolatory rational splines
with point and interval tension is illustrated by following
examples for the data set in R 2 . The curve of Figure 5(a)
shows a cubic B-spline curve with its control points. The
curve of Figure 5(b) shows the effect of increasing a point
tension weight. Both interval and point tension weights
are increased resulting in the curve of Figure 5(c).

Concluding Remarks

\Ve have described the basic theory for a C z rational cubic
spline curve representation which has interval and point
tension weights and which behaves in a well controlled and
meaningful way both locally and globally. The extension
to tensor product surface representations is immediately
apparent. However. this representation exhibits a problem common to all tensor product descriptions in that the
shape control parameters now affects a complete row or
column of the tensor product array. [5] solves this problem for his cubic v-spline representation by constructing a Boolean sum. spline-blended. rectangular-network
of parametric v-spline curves. P4'e have followed the approach in [6] to overcome the above stated problem in the
computation of surfaces.
