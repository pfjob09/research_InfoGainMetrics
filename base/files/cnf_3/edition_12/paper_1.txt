" Intelligent Sensing for Ambient Assisted Living for Ageing"

Abstract

The dramatic increase of the elderly population causes the impending needs for applying new technology for
elderly to improve health conditions and increase the quality of life. With nowadays advance of information and
communication techniques which has brought human daily life with great conveniences beyond the limitation of
spatial and time constraints, there is no reason that the benefits from these techniques are not applied to the
improvement of the healthcare and the increase of quality of life to the older people. Under such a situation,
many national-wide projects have been initiated to integrate manpower to address the universal issue. Innovative
devices with intelligent sensing capabilities are being developed for providing ambient assisted living to the
older people.
Fundamentally the assisted living aims to maintain the older people in healthier life style and functional
capability, to increase their autonomy and mobility, to enhance their security, to prevent them from isolation and
to increase their participation of social network, and etc .. Consequently the functions should be addressed from
multidimensional needs. In this talk, an overview of the ambient assisted living is presented from multiple
perspectives. Techniques and examples of intelligent sensing will also be presented to demonstrate their
applications to ambient assisted living for the older people.

"Rough-Neuro-Fuzzy-Genetic Hybrid Intelligent Systems and Their Applications"

Abstract

In the presentation the rough-neuro-fuzzy-genetic hybridization is discussed. First new neuro-fuzzy systems
are presented and their flexibility issues are pointed out. A high accuracy of flexible neuro-fuzzy systems is
emphasized. A new method for designing and reduction of such systems is developed, including evolutionary
techniques. In the second part of the presentation special neuro-fuzzy systems are studied: type 2 neuro-fuzzy
systems, relational neuro-fuzzy systems and rough-neuro-fuzzy systems. Finally, a method for comparison of
neuro-fuzzy systems is described. Applications include pattern classification problems and nonlinear
modeling. The presentation is based on lecturer's IEEE Transactions papers and books; "Computational
Intelligence", Springer 2008 and "Flexible Neuro-fuzzy Systems", Kluwer 2004

"Social Computing: From Social Informatics to Social Intelligence"

Abstract

In 2007, we published an article with the title of "Social Computing: From Social Informatics to Social
Intelligence" in the IEEE Intelligent Systems, in an effort to jump start "Social Computing" as a new
paradigm of computing and technology development. Since then, a number of special issues on social
computing, social learning, and cultural modeling, and computational social sciences have organized by
several related academic publications. It has become a hot topic attracting broad interest from not only
researchers but also technologists, software and online game vendors, Web entrepreneurs, business strategists,
political analysts, and digital government practitioners, to name a few. Today, social computing has become a
central theme across a nwnber of infonnation and communication technology (lCT) fields, as well as studies
in social and human sciences. In this presentation, we will review some significant progresses achieved the
publication of our article.

"Robust Model Predictive Control Based on Neural Computation and Its Application for Tracking of
Marine Vessels"

Abstract

In this talk, neural computation approaches to robust model predictive control RMPC of affine and piecewise
affine systems will be presented. With bonded uncertainties, the RMPC problem is first formulated as a
sequential minimax optimization problem and solved by using recurrent neural networks. The proposed
neural computation approaches have many desirable properties with superior performance for trajectory
tracking and disturbance rejection. A proposed approach is recently applied for the tracking control of
under-actuated marine vessels. Simulation results are provided to substrate the effectiveness and demonstrate
the performance of the proposed approach.
