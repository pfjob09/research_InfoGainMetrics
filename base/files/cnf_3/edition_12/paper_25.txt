design problem as a whole.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces
COGAs whereas section 3 explains how information is
gathered and visualised using COGAs. Section 4 outlines
the purpose of this preliminary research whilst section 5
describes how the designer is guided towards the
appropriate displays. Results are given and discussed in
sections 6 and 7 respectively.

Abstract
Simple statistical techniques are investigated to
support Cluster-Oriented Genetic Algorithm processes. In
a real world application this analysis improves efficiency
by reducing effort relating to exploration of multiple
visual representations. The preliminaly results suggest
that the designer can easily be guided towards interesting
areas of high performance regions by viewing the most
appropriate two- and three-dimensional plots.

2. Cluster-Oriented Genetic Algorithms
(COGAs)
1. Introduction
VmCOGAs (Variable mutation COGAs) have been
developed to support the designer during the conceptual
design stage by rapidly decomposing complex design
spaces into regions of high performance [4], [ 5 ] , [61.
Regional identification overcomes problems associated
with the identification of single solutions from coarse
design models. Such solutions may at best be indicative
of local high performance whilst at worst they may be
erroneous and misleading [7].
An adaptive mutation regime (mpl, ..., mp5) (Figure 1)
samples the search space and promotes the formation of
discrete clusters of high fitness solutions. At pre-set
generations (fsz, ..., fs6) the fitness of each population
member is scaled in terms of the number of standard
deviations from the mean (Figure 2).
Population
members with scaled fitness greater than a filtering
threshold (Rfz, ..., Rf6) are copied to a final clustering set
whilst also remaining within the evolving population.
During intermediate generations a solution is also copied
to the clustering set if its unscaled fitness exceeds the
fitness associated with the previous filtering threshold.
The filter adapts to the fitness landscape of the current
population and can therefore support a high degree of
explorative interaction between the designer and the
evolutionary process.
Design information such as
variable sensitivity, constraint violation and multiobjective performance can be extracted directly from the
identified regions, eliminating the requirement for further

An Interactive Evolutionary Design System (IEDS) is
under development to aid information gathering and
understanding of ongoing complex conceptual design
issues during multi-objective optimisation of real world
engineering design problems. The IEDS incorporates
various Genetic Algorithm techniques [ 11. The objective
of the research described here is to develop simple
processes that guide the design engineer towards
interesting high performance regions of the search space
through appropriate visual representations.
Real world engineering design can involve many input
variables and a number of objectives. It is extremely
difficult to understand the possible interactions between
variables and between variables and objectives. State of
the art data mining and visualisation for 2 and 3
dimensions such as rotation and distortion techniques can
support understanding [2]. For higher dimensions
clustering and iconic representations can be utilised [3].
However these displays take time and effort to
understand. The clearest graphical representations include
traditional two-dimensional hyper-planes and threedimensional surface plots.
These investigations indicate that there is a need for a
simple approach to inform the designer which variables
show the most interesting solutions in terms of conflicting
objectives and constraint satisfaction. Appropriate

expertise the designer may progress towards the true
global optimal solution by constraining search within one
or more of the identified regions.

3. Information gathering using COGAs
Cluster-Oriented Genetic Algorithms (COGAs [4], [ 5 ] )
identify regions of high performance (HP) solutions
during a Genetic Algorithm (GA [SI) search as described
in section 2. HP regions are investigated by viewing the
appropriate hyper-plane combinations [9].
The real world model used in these preliminary
investigations is the BAe MiniCAPS model (see Figure
3). MiniCAPS is a simplified experimental version of the
CAPS model that BAE SYSTEMS use for preliminary
airframe design [lo]. The model has nine input variables
and thirteen objectives, most of the output objectives
conflict with at least one other objective.
Examples of variable I objective interaction are shown
in Figures 4-7. The HP region relating to Specific Excess
Power 1 (SEP1) is displayed in the climb mach number I
cruise height hyper-plane (Figure 4). These HP solutions
show a uniform distribution across the hyper-plane.
Therefore SEPl is considered to be insensitive to changes
in climb mach number and cruise height variables.
Conversely when the HP region for SEPl is viewed in the
gross wing area I wing tiplchord ratio hyper-plane (Figure
5) the solutions are clearly bounded and cover a small part
of the hyper-plane. Hence SEPl is considered to be
sensitive to changes in gross wing area and wing tiplchord
ratio.
Additional information can be discovered from
concurrent COGA runs that optimise different objectives.
Figure 6 indicates that in the climb mach number I cruise
height hyper-plane HP regions for SEPl and Ferry Range
(FR)are mutually inclusive. Conversely Figure 7 shows
mutually exclusive HP regions between SEPl and FR.
This indicates that the two objectives are conflicting and
finding a compromise region between SEPl and FR for
the gross wing area I wing tiplchord ratio hyper-plane
may be difficult.

Density of solutions within the HP region is also of
interest. In Figure 7 it can be seen that solutions are more
dense in the top right hand corner for FR and in the lower
left hand corner for SEPl. This suggests robust areas of
each HP region to the engineer. Good solutions of FR are
more likely to be found at high values of gross wing area
and wing tipkhord ratio, whilst good solutions of SEPl
are more likely to be found at low values of these
variables.

4. Purpose of preliminary research
The approach is to extract information from coevolving processes, Interesting information includes the

location and distribution of HP regions and the degree of
objective sensitivity in terms of changes in variable
settings. In particular hyper-planes that identify mutually
exclusive regions between objectives need to be
discovered. Results can be presented in short, readable
text-based form where the most interesting hyper-planes
to view are suggested to the user, who may then accept
these suggestions.
The purpose of the preliminary research is to
investigate the best use of statistical analysis in
discovering which combination of variables to display
during concurrent COGA runs. A computer generated
quantitative statistic is required to give a summary of
qualitative analysis to the user.

The sensitivity of solutions in a high performance (HP)
region to perturbations of a variable can be calculated by
normalising the standard deviation of the solutions.
Variable normalised standard deviation is described
below. Density of solution space can be described by
computing the skewness of the distribution.
Two COGAs were run concurrently, one optimising
SEPl and the other optimising Ferry Range. The statistics
measures were taken and compared with the actual visual
information. Conclusions were then drawn as to the utility
of each technique.

MFor each HP region a set of solutions is projected onto
each variable as shown in Figure 8. The projected
solutions are denoted by H, where i is the optimised
objective and j is the variable.
The standard deviation of projected solutions for each
variable is given by 0,.Each variable is bounded by
known values used during the engineering design process.
These are denoted mini and m a j Additionally each
projected HP region is bounded by minimum and
,
maximum values for each variable. These are m i n ~ ,and
m a x ~ , (Figure

5.2. Discovering mutually exclusive regions
The discovery of mutually exclusive regions is easily
computed by comparing the minimum and maximum
bounds of the HF' regions for each variable. For example
the following relation may be found to be true:

min~>
, max

maxi

i

So every HP region is normalised by the same midman
values per variable, giving a fair comparison between the
HP solutions.

5.4 Skewness

HI,.

Implying that when considering solutions projected
onto variable 0, the whole HP region for objective 0 takes
higher values than the HP region for objective 1. Hence
the HP regions for objective 0 and 1 are mutually
exclusive when projected onto variable 0.

The skewness S of each variable describes how much
the data differs from a symmetrical distribution (Figure
8), giving the location of dense regions of solutions for
each HP region H,. It compares the mean meany and
median med, of solutions in each HP region for each
variable.

5.3. Variable normalised standard deviation
The variable normalised standard deviation is
computed by normalising the standard deviation by the
known input ranges, given by the following equation:

-

6. Results
After calculating the minimum and maximum values
of the HP regions for each variable it was discovered that
only variable 3 has completely mutually exclusive regions
between the SEPl and FR objectives. This information is
duly passed onto the engineer.
Lower values of variable normalised standard
deviation V (Figure 9) implies higher sensitivity of the
corresponding HP region to changes in variables. For
SEPl it can be seen at a glance that the HP region is most
sensitive to changes in variables 3, 4 and 7. This
corresponds to the visual results in Figures 4 and 5. The
Ferry Range HP region is more sensitive to changes in
variables 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 7. Again this confirms the visual
results of Figures 6 and 7.
The skewness results (Figure 10) clearly show which
HP regions are symmetric when projected onto variables
and which are skewed. They imply that projections onto
variables 3 (gross wing area) and 7 (wing tipkhord ratio)
have positive skewness for SEPl and negative skewness
for FR.As discussed earlier, these results are borne out by
visual inspection in Figure 7. Other results can be
confirmed by visual inspection of the appropriate hyperplanes.
This information can be quickly given to the engineer
without having to search through all the possible hyperplane combinations. Results can be displayed in a textbased form in order of importance, with suggestions to the
engineer as to which variables to view. A typical output
follows:

Summary:

between S E P l and FR
Suggest view hyperplane 3 ’ 7

7. Discussion
These preliminary experiments demonstrate that much
information can be extracted from a few runs of COGA
using simple statistical techniques. Variable normalised
standard deviation and skewness are simple computations
but describe the data in a succinct manner. Other
measures of sensitivity such as Taguchi methods and near
neighbour clustering are under investigation that will be
needed to describe non-convex HP regions.
Further work will concentrate on suggesting possible
parameter settings to help the user find compromise
regions between mutually exclusive high performance
regions, thus extending the interactive design process.
Three dimensional visualisation techniques will also be
considered. Issues of cognitive overload will be further
investigated by considering the importance of each piece
of information that is presented to the engineer.
