head as in S-F films. All these elements lead to a question
if a rectangular matrix of a pixel is a proper and optimal
one for all these applications. It seems that an idea of a
grid of different shape than rectangular is not a
completely new idea. References on other matrixes can be
found in science publications [ l ] though they are not
discussed there. In spite of thorough research the author
was not able to state what exactly has been elaborated in
this field. However, development of new technologies
may result in detailed study of this matter.
A human eye is very complicated by its nature. Firstly,

Abstract
This article presents a new approach to representing
a pixel in raster graphics. New technologies make this
new approach possible. The author discusses issues
concerning optic resolution of the human eye. Some
technical solutions are proposed, which are currently
being worked out and which can radically change the
approach to raster picture. At creation process of
simulator and virtual reality' quality of a picture is of
great importance. Hitherto prevailing solutions have
many disadvantages. The solution suggested in this paper
is based on the so-called H-pixel. Traditional pixel in
raster graphics solutions is put into knots of grid plate.
The suggested solution is based on a grid with regular
hexagon as a main element. The paper includes analysis
on how such a shape can help in fidelity of reproduction
of set shapes. The algorithms for traditional pixel (Qadric
pixel) have been prepared and checked. The presented
approach to raster graphics can be used in systems where
picture is created, similarly to typography, from a very
good raster but in three (RGB) or four (CMYK) colours.
Accepting H pixel will result in analysis of all algorithms
of picture creation e.g. drawing a segment, circle etc.
Such algorithms as raster picture compression or
algorithms based on quadruple tree (covering invisible
lines) will also need adaptation. Currently it is dificult to
state to what extend this solution will be applied in the
future but it is so likely and interesting that in the
author's opinion it seems worth working on.

as it happens in case of screen based on picture tube
lamps and liquid-crystal display units It is created on a
surface similar to sphere Fig. 1 (diameter about 24mm)
An eye is equipped with two types of receptors of visual
stimuli (cones and rods). On average it has about
9,000,000 cones and 100,000,000 rods. Rods enable
reception of only shades of gray at poor light. Diameter of
rods is 0.002 mm. Cones work at daytime and enable
seeing of hue. Diameter of cones depends on their
location in retina. It is respectively, in the central part of
retina 0.002"
to 0.01"
in circumferentialpart. In the
central part of an eye there is the so-called fovea with
diameter of about 2.3 mm. There are only cones in this
part and the distances between them are equal to their
diameter and are 0.002 - 0.0025. This area covers about 1
degree of visual field. 3 degrees from the center of visual
field resolution decreases by a half and at 5 degrees the
distance is only one eighth, which is located in fovea.
Lighting points are not visible as geometric points but as
a spot. Resolution of human eye is limited by diffraction

1. Introduction
Computer at the beginning of its development had an
alphanumeric screen. Using a picture tube lamp as well as
service of graphic cards suggest a matrix in a form of a
rectangular. The type of a matrix determines many
elements such as algorithms of graphic display, matrix
service in case of liquid-crystal display, fidelity of
presented picture, obtained with the same technologies.
Approaching epoch of simulators can change attitude of
many people to computer and bring new solutions where

effects. Diffraction leads to the fact that a picture of a
lighting point is created on retina in a form of a spot.
Such points are seen separately since their distance is
sufficient [3]. It is assumed that these points will be
visible as separate if they are located not less than half
diameter of scattering spot from each other (the so-called
Rayleigh's criterion) Fig.2. In the course of measurements
connected with astronomy it has been stated that a human
eye is able to differentiate two objects if their angular
distance is not bigger than 1 angular minute. In the
suggested solution this feature of a human eye can be
easily used.

3. Pixel
So far pixel has had a shape similar to square or even
exactly square. It is so in systems of picture display and
e.g. laser printers systems. Such solution results from
using kinescope lamps in computer screens where
electron beam is deflected and falls on luminophor.
Movement of a beam can be compared to typing. A beam
after deflecting into extreme position is relocated to the
beginning. Assuming a screen as a regular matrix
consisting of Q-pixel is much easier in program service.
Algorithms for line or circle display are being worked on.
Many methods of improving created picture have been
elaborated. However, in case of a matrix consisting of Qpixels some drawbacks of representing basic elements are
visible. It is especially visible when we have elements of
similar shapes and close to each other e.g. two segments
which are close and are not parallel or when they intersect
at a very small angle. It is especially visible when we
have e.g. two lines, which create small angle with
horizontal or vertical lines.

2. Computer display units
Shape of display unit also has an influence here. At the
distance of Im range cardinal role is played by the depth
of field. The shape of a display unit should be determined
by the abilities of a human eye. Fig.3 [5,6] shows areas
which are seen by right and left eye and the area of visual
field which is made from arrangementkomposition of
these pictures.

Extensive development of technologies connected with
opt electronics [7,8,9,10,11] can in the nearest future
result in new kinds of computers (optic) as well as new
ways of information transfer not via screen or liquidcrystal display but a new generation of optical-electronic
systems or only optical. In such systems fiber optics will
be surely used (Fig.5 [7]). Computer will be connected
with display unit with a fiber beam. Since these distances
are short it seems to be possible even today, though very
expensive. In situations where there will be a trend to
create virtual reality as accurately as possible costs will
be of smaller importance, especially in simulators etc.
Using fiber optics as a display unit will enable better
creation of 'screen' surface, it will make it possible to e.g.
build flight simulator from outside the cockpit. What is
more, it will be possible to assemble such appliance in a
car without necessity of building special room for
simulator. Such solution will not have disadvantages of
contemporary liquid-crystal display units namely interia
of displayed picture. It will guarantee magnificent
representationof hue and great resolution at small amount
of pixel. Due to principle of operation of such element it
may be necessary to change our opinion on Q-pixel. It

In virtual reality substantial role is played by accuracy
and to be precise the way of picture restoration. The more
realistic picture the better effect. It is possible if it is not
possible to distinguish particular pixels in a picture.

reality picture.

is more impel necessity of creating beams of such
elements. Since shape of fiber section is close to circle
further usage of Q-pixel can cause technological
problems.
H-pixel is the suggested solution to that problem.

rotation by 90") can be displayed. We will get the
beginning of consecutive lines alternately adding or
subtracting 1/2 of pixel width horizontally, whereas
vertically it should be constant leap.
For comparison it has been assumed that surface area
of pixel cannot be changed. It follows that the number of
pixels for surface unit will not change.

should be "lit" it is necessary to change rectangular
(Cartesian)coordinates to the ones suitable for hexagonal

Comparison of a matrix consisting of Q-pixel and H-pixel
is shown on Fig. .6 and Fig. 7. In case of Q-pixel two
directions of drawing a line are privileged: horizontal and
vertical. Remaining lines are presented with bigger or
smaller approximation. Table 1 presents comparison of
certain features. For both Q-pixel and H-pixel distance of

Fig.9 presents principle of operation for such a change.
Naturally, it is a certain difficulty but calculation
capabilities are greater and it should not be a limitation.
It is not always necessary to change rectangular
coordinates to the hexagonal ones. If we assume that axes
do not change but only measures then, width of one
column of H-pixels is measured on axis x and consecutive
unit on axis y in a way that in two neighbouring columns
consecutive numbers are placed alternatively [Fig. 101.

Among features which improve the quality of a picture
we can name the fact that there are more privileged
directions of display. In case of a rectangular grid we can
only talk about choosing four or eight privileged
directions of a pixel [2].

It is not possible to determine all the advantages of this
system since it needs further research.
First of all the display algorithms for basic elements
such as circle or ellipse should be worked out. Other
algorithms will have to be changed too e.g. picture filling
etc. Compression of a picture seems to be an interesting
issue too.
