required preliminary step for many other image-processing
procedures, such as brain registration and voxel-based
morphometry. Therefore, accurate brain segmentation has
become one of the most important issues in MRI applications.
There are many methods available for 3D brain MRI
tissue segmentation. They are broadly categorised into three
frameworks: contour-based, region-based and classificationbased segmentation [1]. Active contour algorithm is a typical
contour-based segmentation [4] [5]. Region-based
segmentation techniques include region growing technique
[6], split-and-merge based segmentation [7], and watershedbased segmentation [8], et al. Classification-based
segmentation includes statistical based classification such as
Markov random field [9], Hidden Markov models [10], and
Gaussian mixture model [11], supervised learning based
segmentation such as neural networks [12], support vector
machine [13], and unsupervised learning such as fuzzy Cmeans (FCM) [14], spectral clustering [15], et al.. In general,
supervised segmentation could get good performance, but it
requires experts supply labeled voxels to the model, which is
expensive and time-consuming in implementation. On the
other side, unsupervised learning without any prior
knowledge will get limited performance. Therefore, semisupervised learning combining some labeled voxels and
unlabeled voxels was proposed [16] to improve the
segmentation results.
The focus of this study is to improve brain MRI tissue
segmentation through the use of the semi-supervised spectral
clustering, in which, we supply some data pairwise
constraints information, instead of labeled voxels to the
spectral clustering algorithm to obtain a better data
assignment. In comparison to [16], this kind of prior
knowledge can be obtained more easily.
The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. In
Section 2, the semi-supervised spectral clustering and its
application in tissue segmentation are presented after a brief
review of spectral clustering. Experimental results on
simulated and real MRI data are provided in Section 3. And
finally conclusions are drawn.

Abstract—Clustering algorithms have been popularly applied
in tissue segmentation in MRI. However, traditional clustering
algorithms could not take advantage of some prior knowledge
of data even when it does exist. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to tissue segmentation of 3D brain MRI using semisupervised spectral clustering. Spectral clustering algorithm is
more powerful than traditional clustering algorithms since it
models the voxel-to-voxel relationship as opposed to voxel-tocluster relationships. In the semi-supervised spectral
clustering, two types of instance-level constraints: must-link
and cannot-link as background prior knowledge are
incorporated into spectral clustering, and the self-tuning
parameter is applied to avoid the selection of the scaling
parameter of spectral clustering. The semi-supervised spectral
clustering is an effective tissue segmentation method because of
its advantages in (1) better discovery of real data structure
since there is no cluster shape restriction, (2) high quality
segmentation results as it can obtain the global optimal
solutions in the relaxed continuous domain by eigendecomposition and combines the pairwise constraints
information. Experimental results on simulated and real MRI
data demonstrate its effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging
technique used primarily in medical settings to produce high
quality images of the inside of the human body. MRI can
provide high contrast images for different tissues, which
makes it an indispensable tool for medical diagnosis in
recent years [1].
Image segmentation algorithms for the delineation of 3D
anatomical structures or tissue types, play an important role
in many researches and clinical studies, involving the
visualisation and quantitative analyzes of anatomical and
functional cortical structures [2] [3]. MRI segmentation
involves the separation of image voxels into regions
comprising different tissue types. Brain tissue segmentation
is usually concerned with the delineation of three types of
brain matters, i.e., Grey-Matter, White-Matter and CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF). It is not only widely used in cortical
surface mapping, volume measurement, tissue classification,
functional and morphological adaptation assessment, and
characterization of neurological disorders, but also is a

METHOD

A. Spectral Clustering (SC)
Recently, a family of spectral clustering (SC) algorithms
[17]-[19] was proposed and has shown great promise.

structure, while k-means clustering failed to split the data
reasonably because k-means clustering performs very poorly
in this space due bias toward dense spherical clusters.

Compared with traditional clustering algorithms, SC has
some obvious advantages. Not only can it be solved
efficiently by standard linear algebra method, but also can
recognize the clusters of unusual shapes. This makes SC
more suitable for many applications, such as speech
separation, image segmentation and so on.
SC treats the data points as the nodes of a graph, and the
pairwise similarities of the data are represented as the
weighted edges in the graph. Then, clustering problems
come down to a graph partitioning problem. By using
different Laplacian matrix or eigenvectors, various spectral
clustering algorithms were proposed. In our work, we make
use of a popular spectral clustering, NJW, proposed by Ng,
Jordan, and Weiss [17], in which the Laplacian matrix is
defined as L = D −1/ 2WD −1/ 2 with D being the diagonal matrix
where D(i, i ) is the sum of i-th row of affinity matrix W. The
affinity matrix W defines the similarities in the data, and
radial basis function (RBF) was often used as the similarity
function with form

wij = exp(− xi − x j

2

/ 2σ 2 )

B. Semi-Supervised SC with Self-Tuning Parameters
Clustering is usually performed when no information is
available concerning the membership of samples to
predefined classes. So, clustering is an unsupervised learning.
SC is an unsupervised method for data analysis. In practical
applications, however, besides the similarity information
used in unsupervised learning, a small amount of background
prior knowledge such as labeled samples or pairwise
constraints between samples are available easily. It has been
demonstrated that incorporating these information into the
clustering and letting it “guide” or “adjust” the clustering
process, i.e. providing a limited form of supervision, can
improve clustering performance in the earlier papers. This
kind of approaches is called semi-supervised clustering.
In practical applications, hand-labeling for large scale
datasets would be expensive and time-consuming. However,
gathering a large amount of unlabeled data is cheap and easy.
Also we are able to get a small amount of prior knowledge,
such as instance labels or some instance-level constraints. It
is easier to obtain the information about which instances do
or do not belong to the same cluster than about the instance
labels. In SC, we need to calculate the similarity of points at
the first step, which makes it easy to incorporate pairwise
constraints provided by users.
Wagstaff and Cardie [20] introduced two types of
constraints: two instances are known to be in the same class;
or they are known to be in the different classes. These types
of constraints are intuitively attractive to the task of data
clustering, and are considered as the hard constraints that
must be satisfied. The two pairwise constraints are: 1) Mustlink, constraints specifying that two instances have to be in
the same cluster; 2) Cannot-link, constraints specifying that
two instances cannot be in the same cluster.
The constraints are generated as follows. We randomly
pick out some instances from different classes in one slice.
For a pair of instances, if they are sampled in the same class,
we generate a must-link constraint. Otherwise, we generate a
cannot-link constraint. After getting the affinity matrix, we
set the must-link entries in the affinity matrix to 1, and the
cannot-link entries to 0.
Although SC has some advantages and has been
successfully applied to some fields, there are still open issues.
One of them is the selection of the appropriate scale in which
the data is to be analysed. SC is highly sensitive to the
scaling parameter σ in RBF kernel shown in eq. (1).
Appropriate setting of σ is crucial for obtaining good results.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to choose the
appropriate σ value for different dataset. In practice, it is
selected by repeatedly carrying out the algorithm for a
number of values of σ and choosing the one which provides
the best result. This is obviously time-consuming. Also, the
interval of values to be tested still has to be set manually. In
addition, a single value of σ may not work well for all the
data points when the input data includes clusters with
different local statistics.

(1)

where σ is the scaling parameter, and wij is the similarity
between samples xi and x j .The top k eigenvectors of L are
used as k-dimension indicator vectors for samples. A simple
clustering algorithm such as k-means clustering is used to get
k clusters.
The main trick of the SC is to map data points into a new
space with k-dimension by means of eigenvector
decomposition. Thus rather than using each voxel intensity
as clustering features, new feature vector for each voxel is
generated for analysis. In the new space, data points form
tight clusters. Therefore, we can get the natural clusters of
data points with k-means clustering in this space. As we
know, traditional clustering algorithm, such as k-means
clustering is only effective for dataset with spherical shapes
in input space, sensitive to initialization and may drop to the
local solutions in some cases, while SC can recognize the
clusters of unusual shapes and obtain the globally optimal
solutions in a relaxed continuous domain by eigendecomposition.

In order to avoid the problem brought about by the
choice of a single scaling parameter σ , local scaling
parameter σ i for each data point Si is calculated as in selftuning SC proposed by Zelnik-Manor et al. [19]. The square

may
be
generalised
as
d ( si , s j )d ( s j , si ) / σ iσ j = d 2 ( si , s j ) / σ iσ j . The affinity
between a pair of points can thus be written as

To evaluate the segmentation results, several measures,

Using a specific scaling parameter for each point allows
self-tuning of the point-to-point distances according to the
local statistics of the neighborhoods surrounding
points i and j .The selection of the local scaling parameter
σ i can be done by studying the local statistics of the
neighborhood of point si . For simplicity, σ i is defined as

σ i = d ( si , sK )
where d ( si , sK ) is the Euclidean distance,

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

The segmentation algorithm was evaluated using both
simulated and real brain MRI datasets. We use T1-weighted
images for our test because they provide the best grey/white
contrast and are commonly used for neuro-anatomical
analysis.

NR
NE − NE ∩ NR
FP =
NR
where N E is the number of voxels detected by segmentation
method as the voxels of tissue T, N R is the number of
reference ground truth voxels of tissue T. Then TP is the
number of voxels of tissue T classified as tissue T, FN is the
number of voxels of tissue T classified as other tissues, and
FP is the number of voxels of other tissues classified as
tissue T.
In addition, overlap metric, a commonly used measure is
recorded also. For a given voxel class assignment, it is
defined as the sum of the number of voxels that both have
the class assignment in each segmentation divided by the
sum of voxels where either segmentation has the class
assignment.
It
is
equivalent
to
TP /(1 + FP ) . This metric approaches a value of 1.0 for
results that are very similar and is near 0.0 when they share
no similarly classified voxels.
In Table 1, there are the Grey matter and White matter
segmentation results on the whole 181 slices of the same 3D
simulated brain volume data with different noise levels 3%
and 7% respectively. We carried out three methods for
comparison, including the proposed method (Semi-SC), kmeans clustering, and FCM. In the implementation of SemiSC, 100 voxels are used to generate the pairwise constraints
information, which is obtained from 100-th slice, and 3000
voxels for segmentation are randomly sampled from 100-th
slice as well. Certainly the 3000 voxels to be segmented
could be randomly sampled from the whole 3D volume data.
From the comparison results, it is shown that k-means
clustering gets slightly better results than Semi-SC and FCM
for Grey matter in the case with 3% noise, while Semi-SC
works better for White matter. In the case with higher noise
level 7%, Semi-SC outperforms both FCM and k-means for
Grey matter and White matter segmentation. In term of
overlap metric, Semi-SC gets 0.8136 for Grey matter, which
FN =

(3)
d ( si , sK ) is the

radication of Euclidean distance, and sK is the K-th
neighbor of point si . In our experiments, we use K=7, which
can get good results.
C. Semi-Supervised SC Combining Sampling and Nearest
Neighbor Strategy for Tissue Segmentation
SC belongs to pairwise grouping methods, which
requires comparing all possible data points for composing
the affinity matrix. Unfortunately, for images of n-voxels,
this leads to a n(n − 1) / 2 voxel comparison problem and
an n 2 eigenvalue problem, which requires great cost of
computation and storage and will prevent this technique
being widely used in medical imaging.
To reduce the computation complexity of using SC, we
adopt a sampling technique. First, N ( N << n) voxels are
randomly sampled from one slice or the whole volume data
for segmentation, and the number of sampled voxels depends
on the size of a dataset, which will remain the same
distribution as the whole dataset. In our experiments, less
than 1% of the voxels in the dataset is typically sufficient for
segmentation.
To generate the pairwise constraints information, M
voxels from different tissues are obtained by interactive
human hints. Then semi-supervised SC is utilised to segment
the (N+M) voxels into k-classes according to their
characteristic. All the other voxels are then classified into
classes based on the nearest neighbor rule to the (N+M)
voxels.
The processes can greatly reduce the computation
complexity, and will make the semi-supervised spectral
clustering suitable for medical imaging segmentation.

Figure 3. Comparison of the segmentation results from k-means, FCM
and our method (from left to right) of 100-th slice of a 3D simulated brain
MRI data provided by BrainWeb, which is T1 modality, 1mm slice
thickness, 7% noise level.

B. Validation on Real Brain MRI Data with Manual
Segmentation
Normal brain MRI datasets and their manual
segmentations by experts were obtained from the Internet
Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) [23] provided by the
Center for Morphometric Analysis at Massachusette General
Hospital. The proposed algorithm was tested on 20 real MRI
brain images and compared with the manual segmentation
by experts and some other segmentation methods. These
data sets were selected because they have been used in
published studies and have various levels of artifacts. A few
of these volumes have low contrast and relatively large
intensity gradients. The volumes have slice dimensions
of 256 × 256 , with resolution of 1×1 mm2. Inter-slice
distance is 3 mm, with the number of slices for each volume
between 60 and 65.
In implementing our method on each of the 20 MRI
datasets, 100 voxels are obtained from the middle slice of
each MRI brain data to generate the pairwise constraints
information, and 3000 voxels for segmentation are randomly
sampled from the same slice. Each volume data is
preprocessed to four underlying clusters, Grey matter, White
matter, CSF, and others. To compare the results with those
provided by IBSR, which only includes the Grey matter and
White matter segmentation results, we therefore recorded the
results of these two tissues.
Figure 4 shows the average overlap metric of the Grey
matter and White matter segmentation results on 20 normal
brains, from six automatic segmentation results provided by
IBSR [23], our method, and the manual method. The best
average performance of the six reference methods is 0.564
for Grey matter and 0.571 for White matter. The White

our method (the top row) with the ground truth data (the middle row) of

data.

is much better than k-means clustering with 0.7641 and
FCM with 0.7855. Similarly, the overlap metric for White
matter got by Semi-SC is 0.8641, which is also higher than
0.8492 got by k-means clustering and 0.8256 by FCM.
Figure 2 presents the comparison of the White matter
segmentation results of our method with the ground truth
data on five of the 181 slices of the 3D simulated brain MRI
data. From the difference between the segmentation results
and the ground truth, it is found that the misclassified voxels
mainly located in the boundary among tissues.
We also give the results of the segmented tissues, Grey
matter, White matter, CSF, and background, for 100-th slice
of the 3D simulated brain MRI data with 7% noise level by
different methods in Figure 3. Visually, the segmentation
results of k-means and FCM are seriously spotty in
consistent regions. Semi-SC performs better than both kmeans and FCM.
According to these segmentation results and comparison
results, the semi-supervised spectral clustering performs
better than the other two methods in the accuracy of result.

matter overlap metric of our algorithm on the whole brain is
0.6925, which is well above those from the other six listed
automatic methods. Meanwhile, it is noted from the
comparison that the proposed method did not obtain better
result for the grey matter with respect to MAP. Because our
method is convenient for users to interact, the segmentation
results may be improved further by adding the number of
voxels to construct the constraints information.

CONCLUSIONS

We presented a semi-supervised 3D brain MRI
segmentation method, which was performed by sampling
voxels in one slice to construct the instance-level constraints
and random selecting a subset of voxels from the same slice
or the whole 3D volume data to construct the semisupervised segmentation. All the other voxels were
segmented according to the nearest neighbor strategy, which
reduced the computation complexity of spectral clustering
greatly. Alternatively, other strategies, such as Nyström
approximation method, watershed transform incorporated
for preprocessing could be applied to speed up the
computation of segmentation.
In this method, there is no parameter to be estimated for
different volume data, which overcomes the time consuming
selection of the scaling parameter in spectral clustering
algorithm. Another advantage of this method is that we only
need to supply the pairwise constraints information in one
slice to gain the whole 3D volume segmentation.
Experimental results are comparable or superior to other
traditional algorithms.
