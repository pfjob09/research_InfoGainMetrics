schema reached its zenith in the seventeenth century at
the École des Beaux-Arts. Clearly, to manually produce
a convincing 3D perspective image we need some
training in its conventions. Today, a lot of the
construction of perspective has been automated. 3D
computer graphics programs now produce convincing
perspective images with little or no understanding
needed on the part of the producer in the algorithms used
in their construction.

Abstract
Most of us can recognize common 3D objects
depicted in drawings, photographs and computer
graphics. But, few of us are able to manually reproduce
them in a convincing manner. This paper discusses a
psychology experiment that investigates the variability in
individual drawing ability and the ability to read 3D
images. Currently, Shepard and Metzler’s [1] Mental
Rotation Test is the most popular test for spatial ability.
This paper discusses the need to further investigate the
correlation of 3D drawing ability and recognition and its
potential effect on the legibility of the 3D information
visualisation application. This paper reports ongoing
research in this field.
Keywords--- 3D images, MRT, 3D information
visualisation, chiaroscuro, perspective drawing.

Introduction
Before humans could write we used pictures to
communicate our thoughts. Cave drawings, petroglyphs
and maps, are examples of picture languages. Primitive
cave drawings are the earliest surviving picture language.
They look a bit like children’s drawings – flattened, with
everything in view at once. When depicting objects in
space, children often include different scales seen from
different angles, all in the one picture. [2] describe this
stage in a child’s spatial development as egocentric.
Rather than depicting just what can be seen, a child will
depict what they know to be within their personal space.
Their drawings include symbolic, metaphoric, or iconic
elements, as well as realistic depictions [3]. Whilst we
grow to understand an allocentric space, few of us ever
develop our pictorial skills beyond the child’s symbolic
level. We might be able to recognise more sophisticated
representations (such as photographs, 3D computer
generated images and chiaroscuro drawings), but we
often cannot manually reproduce or construct our own
convincing 3D illustrations.
Where cave drawings present a flattened space, the
ability to represent spatial depth is only a recent
invention. In a rudimentary form, it first appeared in 1st
century Byzantine, Chinese and Islamic art. But, it was
not until the 15th century that a consistent method was
formulated for constructing what we know today as the
perspectival image [4]. Training in this new visualisation

In the field of information visualisation the 3D
perspective image is used to create abstract organised
representations of complex data sets. The added depth
dimension helps us visualise the ‘space’ of the data.
These abstract ‘information spaces’ are mapped onto 3D
geometry with the added dimensions of: colour, texture,
transparency, animation, sound, haptic feedback and so
on. There are many convincing information
visualisations that use the added depth dimension present
in a 3D display [see 6, 7, 8, 9]. These pictorial displays
can provide an abstract overview of metadata while
preserving its intrinsic properties. The algorithms used to
create these computer-generated perspectives are based
on the same perspective construction techniques
developed in the sixteenth-century Italian Renaissance.

Much of the visualised information in a 3D format
capitalises on the human capacity to see patterns in data
collections. Patterns help us identify interrelationships.
Compared to 2D, 3D representation adds an information
dimension along the 3rd axis that follows the notion that
data occupies space and that we might learn more if we
could navigate that space. However, some researchers
are reporting that presenting information in a 3D format
does not always achieve the desired results –
communicating a better understanding of the information
being presented.
For example, [10] results on the use of 2D or 3D
icons used in aircraft landing navigation favoured the
vertical axis only; [11] 2D and 3D visualisation of
telecommunications traffic found that 3D interfaces
affected user performance in a negative manner; [12]
comparative study of 2D and 3D targets in military
studies identified 2D as more accurate; [13] two and a
half dimensional format proved more efficacious than a
full 3D display; [14, p271] claims that a “full-fledged 3D
configuration could be too complex for users to handle
efficiently”, suggesting a 2.1D or 2.5D interface as a
more useful compromise solution; [15, p57] report that
users find it “more difficult to select objects in a 3D
space compared to 2D”; and, [16] finding that full 3D
views are not functional in their treegraph structures.
The inability for some users to efficiently recognise
the 3D spaces depicted has led to alternative visual
representation methods. For example, [13] argue that,
what they call, a two and a half dimension format is less
ambiguous in its representation of the information space.
It relies on occlusion, scaling and ground plane alone. In
another example, [17] uses a 3D network graph without
object perspective cues (such as smooth, rounded, forms
with specular highlights etc). Instead, it uses depth cues
such as fading in the distance to reduce the overall sense
of a volumetric space. This forces the user to focus on
detail in the foreground. And, [16] adds only minor 3D
cues to their, otherwise 2D, treegraphs in the form of
cushioning, to indicate a textured surface thus reducing
its abstractness and making it appear more organic, and
perceptually more legible. These and other reductions on
the 3D theme respond to the notion that not all users can
efficiently read a full 3D display.
Despite the move to a reduced 3D thematic, none of
these researchers attempt to address directly the reason
why many of their users are more efficient at ‘reading’
the reduced displays. In the field of psychology there are
many tests to determine one’s spatial ability.
The most common test used to determine one’s
ability to recognise 3D objects and spatial arrangements
is [1] Mental Rotation Test (MRT). In the MRT
participants view a misaligned pair of 3D armatures
constructed of cubes and decide whether they are
identical (see figure 2). This test has established that
most people can perform rudimentary mental
transformations of objects. The amount of time it takes
participants to perform the self-congruence task
increases “monotonically with the angular disparity
between objects… [suggesting] that individuals mentally

rotate objects in the same manner in which they
physically rotate objects” [18, p271]. Males are generally
better in accuracy and speed in this test than females.
The [19] version of this test uses different, more organic,
objects (such as body parts) but returns similar results.
Both tests require participants to recognise 3D object
images on a screen or on a printed card to determine
one’s spatial ability. But, neither give us a clue to
variability between individuals – why one participant
might be better than another at the same task.

Figure 2 Original MRT test screens [20, p194].
In the standard MRT the only information available
for identifying individual variance in spatial ability is the
collected demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity).
Unlike the MRT recognition test, if participants are
required to draw, rather than simply identify, common
3D objects there is greater variability in ability than the
MRT.
A person’s ability to draw a common 3D object can
be observed as their ability to accurately represent that
object as a 3D artefact. In a group test, individual
illustrations tend to fall across a range of abilities; from
flattened, child-like to fully realistic chiaroscuro
drawings.
This paper reports on an experiment conducted to
determine what the range of variability in drawing a
common 3D object is. The implications from the results
suggests there may be a correlation with information
visualisation researchers findings that a reduced 3D
format tends to be more legible for some of their users.
The experiment described in this paper identifies
variability across gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic
status as it relates to the ability for a group of first-year
university students to draw a convincing perspective of a
common 3D object. The experiment was used to
determine how a group of participants are able to selfrank their own drawings of a common 3D object from
most to least realistic.
There were two parts to this experiment. In the first
part, 50 first-year undergraduate university students were
given 5 minutes to draw a box in perspective. In the
second part, a different group of 55 first-year
undergraduate university students were given 5 minutes
to draw an apple in perspective. As a control, the second
part addresses the notion that the box in the first part is
an orthogonal object, and, as such, lends itself to
depiction in a 3D perspective (receding lines etc) in a
way that an apple does not. Nevertheless, both the box
and the apple are common 3D objects that share some
common perspective depth cues, such as shading,
shadows and a ground plane.

Experiment
Participants were asked to indicate their gender,
cultural background and socio-economic status by
recording their gender, western or non-western cultural
background, and attendance at private or public school.
On each drawing participants made a marking of:
m = male, or f = female;
w = western, or n = non-western; and,
r = private school, or u = public school.
No other identifying marks were used. These
classifications were used as opposed to others as they
were deemed the least intrusive, thus, potentially
generating the greatest compliance. Of the 105 students
surveyed only 3 chose the option not to provide this
information. As they represent such a small subset of the
data collected their contribution is not included here.
The tables below show a breakdown of student
participants by gender, cultural background, and socioeconomic status for each part 01 (Box) and part 02
(Apple) of the experiment.

The results of the participants' drawings and their
subsequent ranking was analysed statistically by
calculating the spread of ranked values across all
categories (m, f, w, n, r, and u). From the analysis and
comments, there is no difference in a participant’s ability
to produce a more or less realistic perspective depiction
of a box regardless of gender, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. However, in analysing their rationales
for why they ranked their drawings in the ways they did
participants reached consensus that they represented
what they had been taught rather than what they had
imagined in their mind’s eye. In other words, they did
not draw what they saw in their mind’s eye but they
replayed the actions they had been taught regarding how
to draw a convincing perspective box (or apple in part
02) – they ‘visualised’ the finished drawing rather than
the object itself. Their execution of this visualised
drawing varied according to their individual ability.
Those who’s drawings were ranked most realistic selfreport more comprehensive training in depicting objects
in perspective than those who’s drawings were ranked
the least realistic. There was no other variability across
all factors. This was confirmed by graphing and ANOVA
analysis.

The same method was used for each part of the
experiment (Box and Apple). Five groups of six to
fourteen students participated in the first part of the
experiment. Four groups of nine to nineteen students
participated in the second part of the experiment.
Participants were instructed to close their eyes and
imagine a box with equal sides (or an apple in part 02).
After approximately one minute they were asked to open
their eyes. They were then asked to draw what they
imagined. As a group, they were asked to self-rank all
the drawings in order of the most realistic to the least
realistic. Triangulation occurred where students ranked
each other’s drawings describing and debating what
constituted a ‘more realistic’ drawing, and why. In this
way consensus was reached on why each drawing was
lodged in its ranked order before moving on to the next
one. Sometimes re-ranking occurred (moving of
drawings into a position at the more or less realistic end
of the array). This again required consensus before the
final positions could be agreed upon.

The graphs above demonstrate a mostly even spread
of ranked positions, either by classification or category.
Chi-square analysis further suggests no significant
deviation from one category to the next. By combining
all categories at once all classifications were compared
using ANOVA analysis. This showed that the probability
of any classified group, fnu versus fwu ...etc , producing
a more or less realistic box was fairly weak (see tables
below for Chi-Square and ANOVA Results).

Discussion
Not all participants are equally able to produce a
convincing perspective drawing. There was a lot of
variability for both the box and the apple. However, the
variability was uniform across all factors. All
participants were able to recognise the cues that they and
their peers used to describe their drawings as more or
less realistic depictions of a common 3D object. Whether
this reflects their ability to recognise other depictions of
common 3D objects is not clear. From the drawings of
the boxes it seems the conventions for representing a box
in 3D are fairly well understood, albeit with variable
skill. However, in the case of the apple there was greater
variability in the representation methods. Some used
shading and shadows whilst others appear to have used
an outline only. This suggests that representing a box in
3D is better understood than an organic shape like an
apple. It is not clear whether this is due to prior training,
that the box better lends itself to perspectival
representation than the apple, or that each simply
represents the two major facets of a realistic drawing of a
3D object: perspective construction and chiaroscuro
(combined they provide the most realistic impression).
However, that illustrating a box seemed to be better
understood, suggests this may go some way towards
explaining why participants of the MRT have little
trouble in recognising the objects used (orthogonal
stacked box armatures). The implication from this is that
people may need formal training in 3D image
construction at an early age or we cannot expect them to
be able to efficiently utilize them later in life.

The probability of this result, assuming the null
hypothesis, is 0.48. Assuming that the F statistic of
0.9083 with 5 degrees of freedom (it should be 0.05 if
there is a significant difference between the individual
groups m, f, w, n, r, u), hence probability of a correlation
is fairly weak.

Conclusion
Knowing how quickly and accurately people are
able to recognise the orientation of similarly arranged
armatures, constructed of cubes, floating in space (such
as those in the MRT) suggests most people are able to
recognise depictions of these types of 3D objects.
However, when required to draw a 3D object in
perspective results vary widely (more widely for organic

500
506

than orthogonal objects). Hence, it seems recognition and
representation may not be equivalent. The former
requires experiential practice alone while the latter
requires some training or practice. To-date, a test to
correlate the relationship, if any, between one’s ability to
recognise a 3D object and the ability to draw it has not
been conducted. In part, the experiment described in this
paper addresses that gap.
The experiment conducted found that a participant’s
ability to draw a more or less realistic 3D object (a box
or an apple) was statistically invariant regardless of
gender, cultural background or socio-economic status.
However, it also revealed that the participants in this
experiment did not simply imagine a real box or apple
before beginning their drawings. Rather, they visualised
a drawing of a box or an apple. Furthermore, the drawing
of a box or apple they visualised was based on how they
had previously been trained to draw a box or an apple.
Hence, their ability to draw a realistic box or an apple
was contingent on how much training they had had prior
to this experiment. It follows then that training in
drawing common 3D objects may also improve one’s
ability to recognise other forms of 3D representation.
This remains to be tested.
Those who reported having little training in drawing
common 3D objects tended to produce the child-like
flattened perspective drawings discussed at the beginning
of this paper. In the context of information visualisation,
as only a small percentage of participants were able to
construct convincing 3D perspective drawings, this may
go some way towards explaining why the ‘flattened’
perspective information visualisation display interfaces
developed by Cockburn and McKenzie (2004) and others
in response to some user preferences may be more
legible than full 3D.
Perhaps with the demise of fundamental training in
manual illustration skills in the depiction of common 3D
objects in perspective – replaced by computer-generated
perspective (3DCG, 3D Games, Photogrammetry and so
on) – we may find fewer people able to reproduce what
they can otherwise recognise. The fact that some
information visualisation researchers are reporting
greater legibility efficacies with reduced 3D displays
suggests the replacement of manual skills with their
computer-generated counterpart may not lead to
improved 3D object recognition. On the contrary, we
may find that as manual illustrative skills decline so too
do people’s ability to read 3D interfaces. The experiment
described in this paper is provided as a precursor to a
follow-up test to determine if indeed there is a
correlation between manual 3D illustrative skill and
spatio-visual abitlity to recognise the same objects
produced artificially or by others manually.
