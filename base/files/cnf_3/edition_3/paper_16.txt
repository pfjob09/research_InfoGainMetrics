Abstract

trends in their business data sets.”
Visualization of clusters is simple if data is described using 2 or 3 properties (attributes) only: in such a case we
can position each data point into 2D or 3D and look for
places with higher density. But DM is rarely concerned
with data of such simplicity and what is needed are visualization means suited for multidimensional data. One of
such methods is offered by the RadViz algorithm [4] that
has been designed to map data described by 3 or more attributes (multidimensional data) into a planar picture. This
contribution tries to answer the question whether RadViz
algorithm can serve the purpose of identification of clusters
in multidimensional space. First, we give an example of
clusters, that cannot be identified in the corresponding RadViz picture. We suggest certain modifications of RadViz
method which make up for this drawback.
To ensure that the paper is self contained, we start with
a brief review of the original RadViz mapping in the Section 2. The following Section 3 starts by description of an
example of a 5D data set with 3 separate clusters that cannot be distinguished in the RadViz image and mentions two
ways how to tackle this problem. In Section 4, there are
specified general conditions under which one can rely on
the fact that ”any 2 points that are close in multidimensional
space cannot be far apart in the RadViz image based on the
same set of attributes”. In order to ensure this condition
there is suggested a minor modification of the original RadViz algorithm that makes the resulting method more useful
for depicting multidimensional clusters - example from the
Section 2 is used to illustrate this claim in the Section 5. The
final Section draws Conclusions from our observations.

RadViz visualization [4] makes it possible to map data
from Ò-dimensional space into a plane. The paper reviews
those specific properties of this method that are important
for identification of clusters in the original multidimensional data. First, there is described an artificial data set
which clearly points to a certain drawback of the original
RadViz mapping. To resolve the identified problem there are
suggested 2 minor modifications of the RadViz algorithm.
Finally, it is proved that application of both suggested modifications guarantees that the upper mentioned problem does
not re-appear. This claim is experimentally confirmed by a
new visulization of the two original data sets using the modified mapping algorithm.

1 Introduction
Data-mining (DM) is a typical interdisciplinary activity,
which requires close cooperation between two types of experts: those from the target domain (e.g. medicine, banking
or marketing) and those from the DM or machine learning
community. The aim of both these groups of experts is to
identify interesting patterns hidden (but implicitly present)
in the studied data.
Certainly, if the DM experts succeed to prove existence
of clusters or dense chunks of data, they consider it an important step toward understanding the studied data because
such clusters help to identify subgroups of objects with similar properties. The resulting subgroups can help in simplification of the original task provided this is approved by the
domain experts. To do so the domain experts have to be
convinced about existence of identified clusters, first. The
most natural way how to reach this goal is to use data visualization because human mind excels in prompt interpretation
of visual information. It is not surprising that Soukup and
Davidson [10] claim that ”Visualization is a key in assisting business and data analysis to discover new patterns and

2 RadViz
RadViz (Radial Coordinate visualization) [4][5][6] is a
visualization method, which uses the Hooke’s law from
physics for mapping a set of Ò-dimensional points into a
plane. It offers a unique method which can help to identify
relations among data. Its main advantage is that it needs no
104

projections and provides a global view on the multidimensional data.

For simplicity, let us illustrate the upper claim using data
in 5D. Obviously, the idea of the presented examples can
be easily reused in any higher dimension. Let us consider
an artificial data set generated by a system PreDo [11], designed and implemented at CTU to support experiments in
machine learning domain.
Example 1. Let us consider a data set in a domain charand consisting of three
acterized by 5 attributes
separate clusters of points:

RadViz visualization method is a non-linear transformation, the used mapping is ”many-to-one”. Many multidimensional points can be mapped to the same point, what is
precisely expressed in the Observation 1 (a simple consequence of equation (2)): All points from the n-dimensional
¼ ,
space, which lay on a single line crosscutting the ¼
are mapped into a single point in the RadViz plane.
Due to this property it can easily happen that some clusters, which are clearly separated in n-dimensional space,
disappear in the RadViz image.

Each RadViz mapping of points from Ò-dimensional
space into a plane is uniquely defined by position of the
corresponding Ò anchors (points Ë in the Fig. 1), which
are placed in a single plane. The anchors are most often situated around a circle, but this is not necessary. Moreover,
it is supposed that each anchor holds its own virtual spring
of variable stiffness and all the loose ends of the springs are
ÝÒ from
bound together. Let us consider a point Ý½
Ò-dimensional space. This point is mapped into a unique
point Ù in the plane of anchors as follows: for each anchor
the stiffness of its spring is set to Ý and the Hooke’s law of
mechanics is used to find the point Ù, where all the spring
forces reach equilibrium (they sum to 0). The position of
Ù Ù½ Ù¾ is given by the equations (1) or (2).

In the original RadViz each data record is projected into
a plane. Let us introduce one more dimension so that each
data record is projected into the space above the circle in
such a way that its horizontal position is given by RadViz,
while its vertical position corresponds to its distance from
the coordinate origin in the original Ò dimensional space. A
similar solution suggested in [2], while in [3] there is used
a Kohonen network to count value for the third coordinate.
More precisely, let us define the mapping RadVizS as
follows. Let the RadViz image of the point from Ò dimensional space be Ù
Ù½ Ù¾ . RadVizS maps the point
to Ù
Ù½ Ù¾ Ù¿ , where Ù¿ is the Eucleidean distance

of the point from the origin of coordinates ¼
This visualization, denoted as RadVizS, is able to make
use of information about position of clusters ¾ and ¿ , but
the cluster ½ near the center is still blurring. All over the
clusters ½ and ¿ have the same radius 0.1 in the original
data, see Fig. 3, there is a significant difference in the size
of their images in the Fig. 4 and the Fig. 5.

It is obvious that a similar data set can be generated for
any number of attributes. Let us show the spacial relation
among the three clusters for the simple case when three atare considered, only - see the Fig. 2:
tributes

Figure 2: Example 1: Data projection in 3D space
Obviously, all clusters are clearly separated in the original data set, but no hint of separation can be observed in
the corresponding RadViz image - see Fig. 3: While the
data points from the small sphere ½ appear all over the resulting planar picture, the distant sphere cluster ¿ appears
correctly as a small cluster.

After normalization each of the attributes has values between 0 and 1. It means each data record appears in the first
quadrant. In 3D space we can imagine RadViz method as
looking to this part of space through a small hole, which is
placed in the origin of the space. In such a case, we cannot

see all points, since some points block out others. Moreover, we are not able to distinguish a point that is near to the
origin from a point that is distant.
The idea of mirror projection is relatively simple. We
would like to observe the considered space from a different
perspective, so that the points overlaid in the previous view
become separated - this can be achieved by using an aperture positioned somewhere else, for example at the far left
bottom corner. We can ensure this by mirroring the space
around a subspace - this can be ensured by transformation
of the data before normalization.
Technically, we change the sign of one attribute, let it
be the attribute in our example. The new Ñ Ò ÑÙÑ
of this attribute will be  Ñ Ü ÑÙÑ of original and new
Ñ Ü ÑÙÑ will be  Ñ Ò ÑÙÑ. After this transformation
we normally visualize the data by RadViz algorithm, see the
Fig. 6. The complexity of the transformation is Ç´Òµ and
that does not change the complexity of the RadViz method.

Figure 6: Example 1: RadViz Mirror projection
Our aim is to ensure that the distance between RadViz
images of the points and is not bigger than a constant
multiple of Æ . Let us refer to this value as a blurring constant
. It follows from (5) that this can be ensured if Û¾ Æ Æ
Æ.
This relation indicates that there is a direct link between the
lower bound Û used for normalization and the blurring constant , see the Fig. 7. If the lower bound of normalization

is set to Û ¼ , the blurring constant will be
is a acceptable choice.
Based on this relation we can express the Observation 2:
Suppose the distance between 2 points, which both appear
outside of the cube ¼ ¼ Ò , is smaller than Æ . The distance of their RadViz images is not bigger than Æ . This
means that small clusters in Ò-dimensional space remain
small even in the RadViz image.

4 Estimate of distance in RadViz
We would like to find out under what conditions the distance between RadViz images of points, which are close to
each other in Ò-dimensional space, remains small. In order
to provide an estimate of distance between 2 points after
RadViz mapping let us consider a point

5 Example 1 revisited
When we set the data normalization to the interval
½ , the RadViz image for Example 1 changes as shown
the Fig. 9. When we compare the Fig. 3 and the Fig. 9, the
cluster ½ is no more blurred and it has now the same size
as the cluster ¿ . The cluster ¾ again overlaps both other
clusters ½ and ¿ .

The new normalization to the interval ¼ ½ results in
changing the scale of the image. The position of a point in
the RadViz image is calculated in step 3 of RadViz algorithm by the following equation:

The normalized data Ü are from the interval ¼ ½
consequently the denominator of the fraction is always
greater than ¼ Ò, where Ò is number of the dimensional anchors. The position of the point Ù is scaled down by ¼ Ò.
That is why it seems advantages to depict the picture in a
finer scale using a ÞÓÓÑ
¼ Ò. The difference between
RadViz image without zoom and with using the zoom constant is in the Fig. 8 and the Fig. 9.

Even here, the problem of overlapping can be solved by
adding the new space dimension or by the mirror projection
suggested above. The Fig. 10 shows the RadVizS - 3D variant of RadViz. All clusters are separated and moreover the
clusters ½ and ¿ seem to have a similar size.

The mirror projection is shown in the Fig. 11. There was
changed the sign of attribute and the correct Ñ Ò ÑÙÑ

clusters ½ and ¿ is the same again, moreover all clusters
in the data are almost separated.

Conclusions
We have seen that RadViz can serve well to show existence of clusters in data described by several attributes.
This property can be used for design of a bottom-up procedure searching for attributes relevant for certain decisions
or for subspace clustering of high dimensional data [1]. To
reach this goal it is necessary to understand the relation between quality of RadViz image created from Ò dimensional
projection of the considered data and that from projection
with one or several dimensions added. This is the topic we
are currently studying.
