Abstract
In this paper, we consider multicriteria decision aid
(MCDA) problems. GAIA is a descriptive extension of the
PROMETHEE methods. It provides the decision maker with a
two dimensional graphical representation of the multicriteria
problem. A limit of the GAIA method is the loss of information
resulting from the underlying principal components analysis
that can result in inconsistencies with the PROMETHEE
rankings. The aim of this paper is to address this limit by
introducing
new
complementary
GAIA-type
visual
representations. At first we introduce the context and briefly
recall the principles of the PROMETHEE methods. We then
introduce the GAIA method and propose two new extensions:
GAIA-Stick gives a better view of the PROMETHEE ranking,
while GAIA-Criterion enables the decision maker to focus on
one specific criterion. Finally, a numerical example is used to
illustrate the completed GAIA approach and to show how it can
improve the decision process.

2. PROMETHEE
In this section, we remind the basic elements of the
PROMETHEE methods. The reader is referred to [2,3,4]
for a more detailed description. A recent survey of
applications of the PROMETHEE methods can be found
in [1].
We consider the following multicriteria decision
problem: let A = {a1, a2, ..., an} be a set of n actions that
are evaluated on a set of k criteria denoted by F = { f1,
f2,.., fk}. Without loss of generality we can suppose that
all the criteria have to be maximized.
A first step of the PROMETHEE methods is to
perform pairwise comparisons between the actions for
each criterion. To do so, one must associate a preference
function to each criterion. When comparing two actions
and
on criterion j, the difference
,
is first computed. The associated
preference function Pj is then used to convert this
, ) such
difference into a preference degree noted
that:
,
1,
- 0
0 when
,
is indifferent to
for
criterion j,
1 when
,
is strictly preferred to
for criterion j.

1. Introduction
We consider decision problems where a set of
actions are evaluated through several criteria. We focus
on the development of descriptive visual tools to
improve the understanding, the structuring and the
resolution of such problems.
The paper is based on the PROMETHEE-GAIA
methodology. PROMETHEE provides the decisionmaker with a ranking of the actions while GAIA
complements it with a visual representation of the
problem. Our objective is to address some limits of the
GAIA method.

Several typical shapes are proposed for the
preference functions ([3]).
Considering the whole set of actions, a global score
for action
and criterion l is defined as the
PROMETHEE unicriterion net flow:

In sections 2 and 3, we first remind the basic
principles of the PROMETHEE and GAIA methods. In
section 4, we propose two new GAIA-type

is the total inertia of the set of points Φ in
the k-dimensional space. In order to obtain a two
dimensional representation that preserves as much
information as possible, a projection is made on the
GAIA plane defined by the two first eigenvectors.

(1)

In a next step, weights are allocated to the
criteria to represent the decision maker priorities:
,
1, … , ; (with ∑
1 and
0). A
global score called the multicriteria net flow is then
computed as follows:

The quantity:
Δ

(6)

gives the amount of information preserved on the GAIA
plane. It is a measure of the quality of the twodimensional representation of the decision problem.

This score allows to rank the actions from the best
to the worst one. This is the PROMETHEE II ranking.
The interested reader is referred to [3] for additional
PROMETHEE analyses and to [6] for another
interpretation of the net flow score.

The coordinates of the actions in the GAIA
plane are obtained by computing the following Θ matrix:

The PROMETHEE II ranking is prescriptive.
Additionally, a descriptive approach can be helpful to
provide the decision maker with a better understanding
of the structure of the decision problem.

(7)

Therefore the GAIA method can be used to obtain a
graphical representation of the decision problem. It starts
from the unicriterion flows matrix obtained with
PROMETHEE that we note Φ:
Φ

For a two-dimensional representation, we consider only
the two first columns of the Θ matrix.
GAIA provides the decision maker with several
important pieces of information:

(3)

Each row of this matrix represents an action and
each column represents a criterion. This can be viewed
as a set of n points in a k dimensional space (the
unicriterion net flow space). In order to reduce the
dimension and to obtain a two dimensional view of the
decision problem, a principal components analysis
(PCA) [3] is applied on this set of points.

-

The PCA provides a set of k eigenvectors
associated to k eigenvalues. Let us note note λl the lth
largest eigenvalue and vl the coordinates of the
corresponding eigenvector:
V

Φ V

(4)

Looking at the relative positions of the actions in the
GAIA plane, one can observe clusters of similar or
distinct actions.
Criteria can also be represented by axes in the GAIA
plane. Their directions show which criteria are
conflicting and which are in agreement with each
others.
The relative positions of actions and criteria enable
to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the
actions.
The weights allocated to the criteria are represented
by an additional axis called the decision stick. The
direction of the decision stick indicates where the
PROMETHEE II best ranked actions are located in
the GAIA plane. This constitutes a direct link
between PROMETHEE and GAIA.

and

λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ … ≥ λk

However a limit of the GAIA approach is that it
gives an imperfect view of the decision problem. This is
due to the loss of information resulting from the
projection from a k-dimensional space to a plane.
Depending on the value of Δ this can lead to distortions

between actual data and their representation in the GAIA
plane. More precisely the direction of a criterion axis
could not reflect exactly the ranking of the actions on
that criterion, especially when the value of Δ (6) is low.

In GAIA-Criterion the first (horizontal) dimension
of the plane corresponds to one selected criterion. There
are thus actually k different GAIA-Criterion planes.
Without loss of generality we consider criterion fk . The
first axis of the plane then corresponds to the values of φk
and the ranking of the actions according to that criterion
can be observed. The second (vertical) axis is orthogonal
to φk and corresponds to the first principal component
from the PCA applied to the (k-1)-dimensional subspace
orthogonal to φk.

4.1 GAIA-Stick

In the GAIA-Criterion plane all the criteria axes are
orthogonal to the selected criterion.

In this case the first (horizontal) dimension of the
plane is defined by the unit (L2 norm) weight vector:

Where μ1k is the largest eigenvalue by applying a PCA to
the subspace orthogonal to the selected criterion axis.

Hence the projections of the actions on this axis are
proportional to the φ net flow values and correspond to
the PROMETHEE II ranking. The second (vertical) axis
is orthogonal to the first one and is such that the GAIAStick plane gathers as much information as possible from
the decision problem. This axis is the first component
from a PCA applied to the projections of the actions on
the subspace orthogonal to the weight vector. The
coordinates of action ai in this subspace are obtained as
follows:

α i − (α i ⋅ w ) 1w

4.2 GAIA-Criterion

In GAIA-Stick, provided information is fully
constistent with the PROMETHEE II ranking.
In GAIA-Criterion, provided information is
fully constistent with one single criterion.

In the GAIA-Stick plane, all criteria axes are
oriented toward the Decision Stick as the weights of the
criteria are always positive numbers.

We consider two cases:

Where 1 is the largest eigenvalue by applying a PCA to
the subspace orthogonal to the weight vector.

Our objective is to obtain a two-dimensional
representation of a multicriteria problem that contains as
much information as possible and at the same time
provides the decision maker with consistent information
on one specific aspect.

The quantity of information contained in the GAIAStick plane will obviously be lower than Δ. It can be
computed as follows:

In the next section we propose two extensions of
GAIA in order to address these problems.

(10)

And:

This kind of distortion is even more frequent with
respect to the decision stick because the GAIA plane is
computed to optimally represent the actions and does not
take into account the weighing of the criteria. Hence the
representation of the decision stick can be imprecise and
lead to important discrepancies between the actual
PROMETHEE II ranking and the ranking given by the
decision stick in the GAIA plane.

Figure 1 - PROMETHEE II Ranking

Globally the Decision Stick is linked to the
PROMETHEE II ranking: the best ranked actions are
located in its direction while the worst ones (Sports and
Economy) are located in the opposite direction. However
inconsistencies can appear and will be more frequent
when the Decision Stick makes a larger angle with the
GAIA plane, that is when it has a shorter length. This
will depend not only on the quality of the GAIA plane
(Δ) but also on the weights of the criteria.

The PROMETHEE II ranking of the six cars
together with the corresponding values of the net flow
score ϕ are displayed in Figure 1. The first ranked car is
the Sedan B with a ϕ score equal to 0.26 and the second
one is the Luxury 1 with ϕ = 0.05, very close to the
Luxury 2 one. And the last ranked car is the Sport one
with ϕ = -0.19
The GAIA plane for this problem is displayed in
Figure 2. The criteria are represented by the labelled axes
and the cars by the points. Let us note that ∆ 89,6%
and that the quality of the two-dimensional
representation is thus quite good. The non-labelled axis
is the Decision Stick that is obtained by projecting the
weights vector on the GAIA plane. It indicates the type
of compromise achieved by the decision maker
according to the weights of the criteria. As its direction is
closer to the Habitability, Comfort and Fuel
Consumption criteria, we can expect the PROMETHEE
II first ranked actions to be rather good on these criteria
and potentially weaker on criteria such as Price and
Power.

The GAIA-Stick plane is shown in Figure 3. In
that case the first axis is defined by the Decision Stick
and is consistent with the PROMETHEE II ranking as

The Decision Stick also indicates where the
PROMETHEE II best ranked actions should be located.
If we project the actions on the decision stick, we expect
to obtain the PROMETHEE II ranking. Let us remind
that the decision stick is a projection of the weight vector
on the GAIA plane. Therefore its length is directly
related to the angle between this vector and the plane and
we can then observe some distortion. For instance in
Figure 2, Sedan B appears to be third while it actually is
the first in the PROMETHEE II ranking.

flow values: the Sedan B is the rightmost action in the
plane and Sports and Economy are on the left side. The
vertical axis brings additional information with respect to
the profiles of the actions. Two groups of criteria can be
clearly identified: Power, Comfort and Habitability are
directed upwards while Price and Fuel Consumption are
oriented downwards. This shows that actions with very
close ϕ values, such as Sports and Economy, can have
very different profiles. With respect to the original GAIA
plane (Fig. 2), GAIA-Stick is completely consistent with
the PROMETHE II ranking but the global quantity of
information is lower with ΔS = 60.7%.

Figure 3 - GAIA-Stick

Figure 4 shows the GAIA-Criterion plane for
Comfort. The horizontal axis scores are equal to the
unicriterion net flow (1) for Comfort. By construction all
the other criteria are orthogonal to the horizontal axis and
two conflicting subsets of criteria can be identified. As
for GAIA-Stick there is also a loss in the total quantity of
information displayed: in this case ∆ 66.1%.

6. Conclusion
The GAIA-Stick and GAIA-Criterion planes
complement the GAIA analysis. They provide the
decision maker with additional views of the multicriteria
problem. These views should be used together to explore
the structure of the decision problem, to better
understand the characteristics of the actions and to
establish a stronger link with the PROMETHEE II
ranking.
