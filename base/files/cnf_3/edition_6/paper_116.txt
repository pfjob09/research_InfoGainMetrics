Abstract
Due to the fact that the aging human face
encompasses skull bones, facial muscles, and tissues,
we render it using the effects of flaccidity through the
observation of family groups categorized by sex,
race and age. Considering that patterns of aging are
consistent, facial ptosis becomes manifest toward the
end of the fourth decade. In order to simulate facial
aging according to these patterns, we used surfaces
with control points so that it was possible to
represent the effect of aging through flaccidity. The
main use of these surfaces is to simulate flaccidity
and aging consequently.

Introduction

The synthesis of realistic virtual views remains
one of the central research topics in computer
graphics. The range of applications encompasses
many fields, including: visual interfaces for
communications, integrated environments of virtual
reality, as well as visual effects commonly used in
film production.
The ultimate goal of the research on realistic
rendering is to display a scene on a screen so that it
appears as if the object exists behind the screen. This
description, however, is somewhat ambiguous and
doesn't provide a quality measure for synthesized
images. Certain areas, such as plastic surgery, need
this quality evaluation on synthesized faces to make
sure how the patient look like and more often how
the patient will look like in the future. Instead, in

communities, considerable effort has been put forth
to synthesize the virtual view of real or imaginary
scenes so that they look like the real scenes.
Much work that plastic surgeons put in this field
is to retard aging process but aging is an inevitable
process. Age changes cause major variations in the
appearance of human faces [1]. Some aspects of
aging are uncontrollable and are based on hereditary
factors; others are somewhat controllable, resulting
from many social factors including lifestyle, among
others [2].

1.1. Related Work
Many works about aging human faces have been
done. We can list some related work in the
simulation of facial skin deformation [3].
One approach is based on geometric models,
physically based models and biomechanical models
using either a particle system or a continuous system.
Many geometrical models have been developed,
such as parametric model [4] and geometric
operators [5]. The finite element method is also
employed for more accurate calculation of skin
deformation, especially for potential medical
applications such as plastic surgery [6]. Overall,
those works simulate wrinkles but none of them have
used flaccidity as causing creases and aging
consequently.
In this work is presented this effort in aging
virtual human faces, by addressing the synthesis of
new facial images of subjects for a given target age.

We present a scheme that uses aging function to
perform this synthesis thru flaccidity. This scheme
enforces perceptually realistic images by preserving
the identity of the subject. The main difference
between our model and the previous ones is that we
simulate increase of fat and muscular mass diminish
causing flaccidity as one responsible element for the
sprouting of lines and aging human face.
In the next section will plan to present the
methodology. Also in section 3, we introduce the
measurements procedure, defining structural
alterations of the face. In section 4, we present a
visual facial model. We describe age simulation thru
a deformation approach in section 5. In the last
section we conclude the main results and future
work.

Methodology

unknown points Įi are found using the blossoming
principle [8] to form the control polygon of that face.
The first step consisted in the selection of the
group to be studied. Proposing the assessment of the
face aging characteristics it will be necessary to have
a photographic follow-up along time for a group of
people, in which their face alterations were
measurable.
The database used in this work consisted of files
of patients who were submitted to plastic surgery at
Medical Center Praia do Guaíba, located in Porto
Alegre, Brazil.

Measurements

According to anatomic principles [9] the vectors
of aging can be described as
n

A methodology to model the aging of human face
allows us to recover the face aging process. This
methodology consists of: 1) defining the variations
of certain face regions, where the aging process is
perceptible; 2) measuring the variations of those
regions for a period of time in a group of people and
finally 3) making up a model through the
measurements based on personal features.
That could be used as a standard to a whole group
in order to design aging curves to the facial regions
defined.

which alter the position and appearance of key
anatomic structures of the face as can be shown in
figure 1 which compares a Caucasian mother age 66
(left side) with her Caucasian daughters, ages 37
(right above) and 33 (right below) respectively.

Mathematical Background and Analysis

Human society values beauty and youth. It is well
known that the aging process is influenced by several
parameters such: feeding, weight, stress level, race,
religious factors, genetics, etc. Finding a standard set
of characteristics that could possibly emulate and
represent the aging process is a difficult proposition.
This standard set was obtained through a
mathematical analysis of some face measurements in
a specific group of people, whose photographs in
different ages were available [7]. To each person in
the group, there were, at least, four digitized
photographs. The oldest of them was taken as a
standard to the most recent one. Hence, some face
alterations were attained through the passing of time
for the same person.
The diversity of the generated data has led to the
designing of a mathematical model, which enabled
the acquiring of a behavior pattern to all persons of
the same group, as the form of a curve defined over
the domain [0,1] in general, in order to define over
any interval [0,Į] for an individual face. The

Therefore, basic anatomic and surgical principles
must be applied when planning rejuvenative facial
surgery and treating specific problems concomitant
with the aging process.

Visual Facial Model

The fact that human face has an especially
irregular format and interior components (bones,
muscles and fabrics) to possess a complex structure
and deformations of different face characteristics of
person to person, becomes the modeling of the face a
difficult task. The modeling carried through in the
present work was based on the model, where the
mesh of polygons corresponds to an elastic mesh,
simulating the dermis of the face. The deformations
in this mesh, necessary to simulate the aging curves,
are obtained through the displacement of the
vertexes, considering x(t) as a planar curve, which is
located within the (u,v) unit square. So, we can
cover the square with a regular grid of points
bi,j=[i/m,j/n]T; i=0,...,m; j=0,...,n. leading to every
point (u,v) as

from the linear precision property of Bernstein
polynomials. Using comparisons with parents we can
distort the grid of bi,j into a grid b'i,j, the point (u,v)
will be mapped to a point (u',v') as

accurately correspond to the model 3D of that is
made use [9].
The detected feature points are used for automatic
texture mapping. The main idea of texture mapping
is that we get an image by combining two orthogonal
pictures in a proper way and then give correct texture
coordinates of every point on a head.
To give a proper coordinate on a combined image
for every point on a head, we first project an
individualized 3D head onto three planes, the front
(x, y), the left (y, z) and the right (y, z) planes. With
the information of feature lines, which are used for
image merging, we decide on which plane a 3D-head
point on is projected.
The projected points on one of three planes are

then transferred to one of feature points spaces such
as the front and the side in 2D. Then they are
transferred to the image space and finally to the
combined image space.
The result of the texture mapping (figure 2) is
excellent when it is desired to simulate some
alteration of the face that does not involve a type of
expression, as neutral. The picture pose must be the
same that the 3D scanned data.

As the displacements of the vertexes conform to
the certain measures gotten through curves of aging
and no type of movement in the face is carried
through, the parameters of this modeling had been
based on the conformation parameter.

Textures mapping

In most cases the result gotten in the modeling of
the face becomes a little artificial. Using textures
mapping can solve this problem. This technique
allows an extraordinary increase in the realism of the
shaped images and consists of applying on the
shaped object, existing textures of the real images of
the object.
In this case, to do the mapping of an extracted
texture of a real image, it is necessary that the texture

Age Simulation

This method involves the deformation of a face
starting with control segments that define the edges
of the faces, as

Those segments are defined in the original face
and their positions are changed to a target face. From
those new positions the new position of each vertex
in the face is determined.
The definition of edges in the face is a
fundamental step, since in that phase the applied
aging curves are selected. Hence, the face is divided
in influencing regions according to their principal
edges and characteristics.
Considering the face morphology and the
modeling of the face aging developed [10], the face
was divided in six basic regions (figure 3).
The frontal region (1) is limited by the eyelids and
the forehead control lines. The distance between
these limits enlarges with forward aging.
The orbitary region (2) is one of the most
important aging parameters because a great number
of wrinkles appears and the palpebral pouch
increases [11]. In nasal region (3) is observed an
enlargement of its contour.
The orolabial region (4) is defined by 2 horizontal
control segments bounding the upper and lower lips
and other 2 segments that define the nasogenian fold.

The definition of the straight-line segment will
control the aging process, leading to a series of tests
until the visual result was adequate to the results
obtained from the aging curves. The extremes of the
segments are interpolated according to the previously
defined curves, obtained by piecewise bilinear
interpolation [12].
Horizontal and vertical orienting auxiliary lines
were defined to characterize the extreme points of
the control segments (figure 4). Some points, that
delimit the control segments, are marked from the
intersection of the auxiliary lines with the contour of
the face, eyebrow, superior part of the head and the
eyes. Others are directly defined without the use of
auxiliary lines, such as: eyelid hollow, eyebrow
edges, subnasion, mouth, nasolabial wrinkle and
nose sides.

Figure 4 - Points of the control segments

Figure 3 - Regions considering the aging
parameters
The lips become thinner and the nasogenian fold
deeper and larger. The mental region (5) have 8
control segments that define the low limit of the face
and descend with aging. In ear curve (6) is observed
an enlargement of its size. The choice of feature lines
was based in the characteristic age points in figure 6.
The target face is obtained from the aging curves
applied to the source face, i.e., with the new control
segment position, each vertex of the new image has
its position defined by the corresponding vertex in
the target face. This final face corresponds to the
face in the new age, which was obtained through the
application of the numerical modeling of the frontal
face aging.

Once the control segments characterize the target
image, the following step of the aging process can be
undertaken, corresponding to the transformations of
the original points to the new positions in the target
image. The transformations applied to the segments
are given by the aging curves, presented in section 4.
In the present work the target segments are
calculated by polynomial interpolations, based on
parametric curves [12].

5.1

Deformation approach

The common goal of deformation models is to
regulate deformations of a geometric model by
providing smoothness constraints. In our age
simulation
approach,
a
mesh-independent
deformation model is proposed. First, connected
piece-wise 3D parametric volumes are generated
automatically from a given face mesh according to
facial feature points.
These volumes cover most regions of a face that
can be deformed. Then, by moving the control points

of each volume, face mesh is deformed. By using
non-parallel volumes [13], irregular 3D manifolds
are formed. As a result, smaller number of deform
volumes are necessary and the number of freedom in
control points are reduced. Moreover, based on facial
feature points, this model is mesh independent,
which means that it can be easily adopted to deform
any face model.
After this mesh is constructed, for each vertex on
the mesh, it needs to be determined which particular
parametric volume it belongs to and what value
parameters are. Then, moving control points of
parametric volumes in 3D will cause smooth facial
deformations, generating facial aging through
flaccidity, automatically through the use of the aging
parameters. This deformation is written in matrices
as V BE , where V is the nodal displacements of
face mesh, B is the mapping matrix composed of
Bernstein polynomials, and E is the displacement
vector of parametric volume control nodes.
Given a quadrilateral mesh of points mi,j,
(i, j )  1,..., N u 1,..., M , we define a
continuous aged surface via a parametric
interpolation of the discretely sampled similarities
points.
The
aged
position
x(u , v), u  i, i  1 , v  j , j  1 is defined via a
bicubic polynomial interpolation of the form

satisfy the known normal and continuity conditions
at the sample points xi,j.
An interactive tool is programmed to manipulate
control points E to achieve aged expressions making
possible to simulate aging through age ranges. Basic
aged expression units are orbicularis oculi, cheek,
eyebrow, eyelid, region of chin, and neck [14].
In general, for each segment, there is an
associated transformation, whose behavior can be
observed by curves. The only segments that do not
suffer any transformation are the contour of the eyes
and the superior side of the head.

mentioned, the first frame needs to be approximately
frontal view and with no expression.
Secondly, in the facial model initialization, from
the first frame, facial features points are extracted
manually. The 3D fitting algorithm [15] is then
applied to warp the generic model for the person
whose face is used. The warping process and from
facial feature points and their norms, parametric
volumes are automatically generated.
Finally, aging field works to relieve the drifting
problem in template matching algorithm, templates
from the previous frame and templates from the
initial frame are applied in order to combine the
aging sequence. Our experiments show that this
approach is very effective.
Despite interest has been put in presenting a
friendly user interface, we have to keep in mind that
the software system is research oriented. In this kind
of applications an important point is the flexibility to
add and remove test facilities.

Results

The presented results in the following figures
refer to the emulations made on the frontal
photographs, principal focus of this paper, with the
objective to apply the developed program to other
persons outside the analyzed group. The comparisons
with other photographs of the tested persons depend
on their quality and on the position in which they
were taken.
An assessment was made of the new positions, of
the control segments. It consisted in: after aging a
face, from the first age to the second one, through the
use of polynomial interpolation of the control
segments in the models in the young age, the new
positions are then compared with the ones in the
model of a relative of older age (figure 5). The
processed faces were qualitatively compared with the
person’s photograph at the same age.

Deformation approach

The developed program also performs shape
transformations according to the created aging
curves, not including any quantification over the
alterations made in texture and skin and hair color.
Firstly, in the input model the subjects are
required to perform different ages, as previously

Conclusions

Modelling biological phenomena is a great deal of
work, especially when the biggest part of the
information about the subject involves only
qualitative data. Thus, this research developed had
has a challenge in the designing of a model to
represent the face aging from qualitative data.
Due to its multi-disciplinary character, the
developed methodology to model and emulate the
face aging involved the study of several other related
fields, such as medicine, computing, statistics and
mathematics.
The possibilities opened by the presented method
and some further research on this field can lead to
new proposals of enhancing the current techniques of
plastic face surgery. It is possible to suggest the ideal
age to perform face lifting. Once the most affected
aging regions are known and how this process occurs
over time. Also missing persons can be recognized
based on old photographs using this technique.
