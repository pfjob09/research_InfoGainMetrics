Introduction

Abstract

1.

Conventionally, a grid generator requires either
explicit or without explicit description about the
boundary vertices, boundary lines and boundary faces to
define the geometry, whereby a CAD system or an
anisotropic grid generation with intersection-based
geometry interface can be deployed to generate grids.
Whatever the case, this compute intensive process, quite
often, has a non-interactive, non-Web-based interface
and without instant visualization. While grid generator
can be used to generate grid geometry art, any 2D image
editing program can also be deployed, nevertheless, the
result is a static display of a pixel- or vector-based image.

As art is the product of nature as well as the
human mind. A spider web, a honeycomb or a shell
pattern not only reveals astonish designs, its inherit
self-organization can be translated into complex
mathematics thus yielding new visualization for
algorithm [1] and new algorithms for visualization [2].
As the essence of art has always been the creation of
'what it could be', as opposed to what exists, art is thus a
powerful mimesis, abstraction and morphogenesis tool.
Examples of art that can be mathematically derived are
grid geometry art; examples of algorithm that are
inspired by art are Delaunay triangulation [3].

This paper describes an interactive Web-based
visualization as a fundamental medium for visualization,
one that changes the way grid geometry art are being
visualized, developed, generated and delivered. The
author first provides relevant background of grid
geometry art, discusses several existing methodologies
and their inadequacy currently used within the Web
environments. She offers a new paradigm -- a Web-based
interactive development tool that integrates an interface
for exploration, structuring and dissemination of
visualization results for grid geometry art. Such is an
instant conceptualization and artistic interpretation of an
image as an arrangement of an uniform m x n grid of
colored cells: quadrilaterals formed within a set of finite
orthogonal grids.

Mainstream mathematics assumes a reductionist
ontology about geometry: it treats lines and planes as sets
of points –– where a point is a position in a given
n-dimensional space. A point may thus be represented as
an n-tuple of numbers: the Cartesian coordinates which
specify its position. For example, a point in a
two-dimensional plane, is described by a pair, the x and
y-coordinates. However, this mathematical point of view
does not translate into a practical convention for finite
computational representations. The mathematical
correlation of a visible shape or line-segment is a set of
uncountable points, and the coordinates of most of these
points are not integers but irrational numbers which
cannot be represented in a finite way.

The parameter-driven algorithm with minimal
user setup for "automatic" idea generation provides the
tools for constructing De Stijl, Abstraction Geometry -Concentric Squares geometrical objects from numerical
arrays not only makes and manipulates, it distributes
geometric shapes over planes, as well as performs color
and rectangular shape transformations. The author briefly
discusses the tool, demonstrates and renders specific
examples of the art thus created as she illustrates the
advantages of using a single tool to embrace the
structuring and delivery of a garden variety of grid
geometry art.
Keywords: orthogonal grids, grid geometry art,
interactive Web-based, visualization, 2D geometry tools,
scalable pixel-free images, mathematics and art.

Thus, in the design of image-generation
algorithms , the representations to be used does not have
to be derived from mathematical first principles. No
image-generation algorithm can explore the space of all
possible images, achieve instant visualization, decide and
eliminate all undesired images, mathematically. Any
algorithm must be based on a definition of a space of
finitely represented images, specify this definition prior
to arriving the decision for image selections.
As such, this paper offers a new paradigm -- a
Web-based interactive development tool that integrates
an interface for exploration, structuring and
dissemination of visualization results for grid geometry
art. It describes an interactive Web-based visualization as
a fundamental medium for visualization [4], one that
changes the way grid geometry art are being visualized,
developed, generated and delivered.

Grid Geometry Art

2.1

Definition

Fig 3 Stijl Rug, 1919 by Georges Vantongerloo

Grid geometry art is defined as an image formed
by partitioning a given space into cells. It is a color-filled
planes bounded (or unbounded) by one or more
interlocking grids. Commonly seen grid geometry art are
represented by the following:

2.2

De Stijl (Dutch, 1917-1931)

An abstractionist movement that produces
"universal" aesthetic by using vertical lines (man) and
horizontal lines (the horizon) representing the world to
produce a grid. Piet Mondriaan (Dutch, 1872 - 1944)
who used orthogonal components with almost exclusively
thick horizontal and vertical black lines with only
primary colors (red, yellow and blue) is a clear example
(Figure 1, 2) of De Stijl [5], [6]. Others include Georges
Vantongerloo (Belgian, 1886 – 1965) (Figure 3, 4), Theo
van Doesburg (Dutch Neo-Plasticist Painter, 1883-1931)
(Figure 5, 6) and Bart van der Leck (Dutch, 1876-1958)
(Figure 7).

Ordered or non-ordered squares

2.3
Abstraction Geometry -- Concentric
Squares
Another representation of abstract geometry art
is the creation of concentric squares, for example, works
by Josef Albers (German-born American, 1888-1976)
(Figure 8, 9) and Frank Stella (American, 1888-1976)
(Figure 10, 11).

Still another category of grid geometry art is
represented by a displacement of orthogonal ordered or
non-ordered squares. Examples are works by Ellsworth
Kelly (American, 1923) (Figure 12, 13), Kenneth Noland
(American, 1924) (Figure 14, 15), Paul Klee (German
Swiss, 1879-1940) (Figure 16, 17) and Mark Rothko
(Latvian born American 1903-1970) (Figure 18,19).

Grid Geometry

Basically, there are two types of grid geometry:
the centrifugal grid and the centripetal grid.
Fig 16 Farbtafel, 1930 by Paul Klee

3.1

Centrifugal Grid

The centrifugal grid form represents continuities
to which its extends the unlimited expansion of an
inherently open system. By definition, a fragment or
synecdoche of an unbounded and unlimited field that can
never be known in its entirety, with open-ended
coordinates.

Centripetal Grid

In contrast, the centripetal grid is a bounded
figure. Its extent is known and limited. The force of the
centripetal grid is contained and implosive. Unlike the
centrifugal grid, it does not represent space beyond itself.
It is a discrete and thus emblematic form. As a discrete
and closed figure, the centripetal grid is cut off from its
context. This discontinuity between the grid and the
spatial field creates a condition that does not exist in
open, centrifugal organization. As an isolated fragment,
the centripetal grid posits an outside to its own outside.
The greater spatial field becomes not a site of immanent
expansion, but an outside that is alien to its own interior:
a spatial context that is uniquely defined as residual.

Existing Methodologies

4.1

Raster Graphics

Any category of grid geometry art described
herein can be realized by imagining the desired order,
describing, specifying and translating this image data into
an image editing software to create the image. As such,
any subsequent modification of image color and or
geometry has to be redefined and it would require a
re-specification of image data in part or in total,
depending on the extent of the modification. And most
significantly, raster graphics [7] demonstrates its

weaknesses in the strength of the image scalability and
hence the retention power of the original image
resolution and losslessness.

4.2

Scalable Vector Graphics

Except for the deployment of vector algebraic
construction of an ‘imagined’ or ‘visualized’ image,
scalable vector graphics [8], [9], [10], [11] is similar to
raster graphics albeit its improvement over the raster
paint lies in its power in image scalability. Nevertheless,
it is not limitless, and modification of any preconceived
ideas would require redefinition of its geometry.

4.3

Web-based HTML

Away from the paint- or draw-based methods,
all categories of grid geometry art can be created by
HTML [12] (Figure 20, 21, 22). This declarative
authoring tool provides instant visualization over the
Web and it is easy to modify the high-level description of
the image color, geometry and displacement. Such
domain specific language (DSL) approach has the
advantage over the use of ‘paint semantics’ software in
its absolutely scalability power and device portability.

Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)

HTMLs can be stored inline as well as external
style sheets in different ways, and all styles can be
cascaded into a new “virtual” style sheet. However, be it
HTML or style sheet, though reusable and
“specification-friendly”, it can only define one category
of grid geometry art per definition at a time. It lacks
‘displacement portability’.

4.5

Java Applets

Generating grid geometry art by the
Web-friendly tag- and attribute- based HTMLs or CSS
method can also be scripted for the more code minded
and savvy authors for Java as a programming language
[13], [14] is almost guaranteed to provide the author with
sufficient power to implement virtually anything, but the
costs of complexity, lack of portability, and the overhead

associated with the implementation of such a language
are such that it is by no means clear that use of this
programming language is a preferred approach to
authoring. Though it can also be parameter driven, it also
suffers ‘displacement and device portability’.

5.

JavaScript Algorithm

A better approach to generate grid geometry art
is to define an algorithm-based template with parameters
for color, geometry, style and displacement to describe
the image, whereby such template can then be
instantiated with different property values at each
instance to generate one or more than one similar or
dissimilar grid geometry images of the same or different
styles at any one time. This simple or complex images
thus generated can freely move on the Web, rearranged,
visualized and form a new image. This one formula
Web-based parameter-driven array-based JavaScript can
be used to visualize and generate different category of
highly scalable grid geometry art herein.

6.

Conclusion

As described, grid geometry art can be created
by the most primitive raster or vector graphics and Java
applets, the respective shortcomings have led the author
to design a Web-based algorithm to instantly express and
achieve grid-based art to embrace complexity at the core
of grid geometry art. In this case, the grid does not
instantiate the mathematical image conception –– it
denotes it. As such, authors can channel their creative
efforts in an interactive environment for the visual
construction of grid geometry art.
