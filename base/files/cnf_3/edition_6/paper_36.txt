Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach (1) to define,
analyze, and map a scientific discipline and (2) to
compare and map the expertise of single authors based
on personal bibliography files, e.g., bibtex or EndNote
files. Section one motivates this research and relates it to
existing work. Section two explains the general
procedure from data harvesting, parsing, cleaning via
the analysis and mapping of the data to the
interpretation of results. To illustrate the new approach,
we asked major experts on ‘network science’ to share
their bibtex or EndNote files with us. Using this data set
we exemplify data harvesting, data cleaning and
integration; give simple statistics, analysis and
visualization results such as a map of the network
science discipline based on co-author networks and a
map of the content coverage and overlay of contributing
experts. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and
opportunities as well as planned future work.
Keywords---bibliography, co-author network,
network analysis, information visualization.

1. Introduction
Bibliometric and scientometric studies of scientific
disciplines and the rendering of results as knowledge
domain visualizations [3, 4, 17] aim to answer questions
such as: What are the major research areas, experts,
institutions, regions, nations, grants, publications,
journals in a specific research field? Which areas are
most insular? What are the main connections for each
area? What is the relative speed of areas? Which areas
are the most dynamic/static? What new research areas
are evolving? Impact of the research in this field on other
fields? How does funding influence the number and
quality of publications? The studies are commonly
conducted based on publication datasets downloaded
from major digital libraries or online sources. In order to
map a specific discipline, keyword based searches for
relevant phrases are run or cited reference search is used
to retrieve all papers that are cited by or are citing a set
of seminal papers.

There are two major problems with this approach.
Firstly, very few individuals have access to high quality
publication data, e.g., the Web of Science served by
Thomson Scientific. Secondly, at a time of increasing
disciplinary specialization, it is very hard if not
impossible to identify appropriate search phrases or the
complete set of seminal papers that can be used to
retrieve all relevant papers. This is particularly an issue
for newly emerging or highly interdisciplinary research
areas.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
acquire a dataset that covers a specific area of research.
Instead of querying databases, major experts in an area
of interest are invited to share their personal bibliography
files and to identify other experts that should be invited
to submit personal bibliographies. Based on the resulting
bibliography data, (1) an analysis and visualization of a
scientific discipline can be conducted and (2) the content
coverage and overlap of personal bibliographies can be
compared and mapped.
Subsequently, we detail the data acquisition and data
cleaning phase, describe the data analysis and mapping,
and discuss results. The emerging, interdisciplinary area
of ‘network science’ was chosen to illustrate the different
steps and to interpret results. Obviously, the same
approach can be applied to delineate and map other areas
of science.

2. Data Collection
As mentioned before, our approach does not require
access to any database. Instead we invited major experts
to share their personal bibliographies with us. Interested
to map the area of ‘network science’ we queried and
received bibliography files from major experts in this
area such as:
x Albert-László Barabási – a physicist most wellknown for his research on scale-free networks. He is
the author of ‘Linked: How Everything Is Connected
to Everything Else and What It Means’ [2].
x Noshir S. Contractor – a researcher in the area of
communication science. He co-authored ‘Theories
of Communication Networks’ [9].
x Loet Leydesdorff – has published extensively in the
philosophy of science, social network analysis,

scientometrics, and the sociology of innovation. He
co-authored ‘The Challenge of Scientometrics: The
Development, Measurement, and Self-Organization
of Scientific Communications’ and ‘A Sociological
Theory of Communication: The Self-Organization
of the Knowledge-Based Society’ [7, 8].
José F. F. Mendes – a physicist who co-authored
‘Evolution of Networks: From Biological Nets to the
Internet and WWW’ [6].
Mark E. J. Newman – a major expert in the area of
physics & social sciences [10-12].
Mike Thelwall – a researcher in the area of
information science, particularly webometrics. He
authored ‘Link Analysis: An Information Science
Approach’ [14].
Alessandro Vespignani – a physicist studying the
Internet as well as the spread of epidemics. He coauthored ‘Evolution and Structure of the Internet: A
Statistical Physics Approach’ [13].
Duncan Watts – a researcher in the area of sociology
and author of ‘Small Worlds: The Dynamics of
Networks between Order and Randomness’ [16].
Stanley Wasserman – a major social network
researcher and statistician and co-author of ‘Social
Network Analysis: Methods and Applications’ [15].

EndNote
formatted
files.
CiteULike
(http://www.citeulike.org/) was used to convert bibtex
files into EndNote format. Some bibliography files were
provided in free form text – analogous to the lists of
references one sees in publications or books. Diverse
approaches were tried to parse and clean this data yet the
result quality was unsatisfactory due to inconsistencies in
the formatting. Some authors provided files in different
formats. Ultimately, Wasserman’s and Leydesdorff ‘s
files, about 50% of Mendes’ and Newman’s files, and a
very small percentage of Barabási’s files could not be
parsed automatically and had to be excluded from the
subsequent analysis.
The resulting cleaned bibliography database
comprised 5,425 unique articles (match based on title
information) and 5,330 unique authors (based on last
name and first initial) in the area of network science
across several disciplines including physics, biology,
information science, and social sciences. Because each
set of articles had been contributed by a certain expert,
each unique article can be associated with all expert
contributors that listed/submitted this article. Hence, the
coverage and overlap of personal bibliographies can be
studied. Figure 1 shows the database schema used to
store the bibliographic data.

Our request for data used the following wording:
”Dear xxx,
László [Barabási] inspired an exercise to map Network
Science on a large scale. Stan [Wasserman], László, Alex
[Vespignani], and I decided that the bibliographies of
major books & review articles might be a good starting
point.
I would appreciate if you point me to (don't send me the
MB files!) as clean and as complete as possible
bibliographies. EndNote or bibtex file format will work
best. We will then parse out and map the co-author
network.
Ideally, the resulting map will become an effective visual
interface to major papers, books, etc. and expertise. It
might also help to understand the structure and evolution
of this growing field. The map will become particularly
valuable if network science researchers start to enter their
own publication data as it becomes available.
Best regards,
k
PS: Should I contact anybody else to contribute
bibliographies?”

In response to our request, we received 13 files in
EndNote, bibtex, and free text format that contained over
7,000 articles including duplicates. Subsequently, we
explain the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

3. Data Parsing and Data Integration
Bibliography files in standard format such as
EndNote & bibtex required the coding of special parsers
but did not pose a problem in terms of automatic
processing. Parsers were written to extract data from

Figure 1: Database schema interlinking contributor,
article, and author information.
It quickly became obvious that most contributors
had generously sent us their complete bibliography files
– comprising not only the references in their books but
potentially all papers they ever read and cited. It also
appears to be common – and is quite convenient – to
share and merge bibliographies with co-authors. Coauthors with a long joint history or co-authors that
merged large bibliographies might be easily identifiable.
Unfortunately, researchers use EndNote fields quite
creatively. ‘Publisher’ entries end up in ‘pages’ fields,
there are some cases of an article having no ‘title’ entry.
While asking major researchers for the bibliography files
is an easy way to quickly acquire data, getting that data
cleaned and into a database is difficult due to formatting
and consistency problems. Parsing and data integration
problems and the need to exclude some files from the
analysis are likely to adversely affect the subsequently
presented results.

4. General Statistics

5.1 Mapping Scientific Disciplines Based on Personal
Bibliographies

With the cleaned data in a properly setup database,
diverse data analysis queries can be run easily. The
oldest article was published in 1637 and was contributed
by Contractor. The year with the maximum number of
articles is 2002. Figure 2 shows the distribution of
articles per author in a log-log plot. It clearly follows a
power law with very few authors having published many
papers while most authors have very few papers.

To map major experts in network science, we
analyzed the co-author network of 5,330 unique authors
using social network analysis [15] techniques. The
authors are grouped into 266 components. The
distribution of the component size is given in Figure 4.
There are 14 components that have more or equal than
10 nodes. The largest component has 131 nodes.

Next, we were interested to see how many
bibliographic articles were supplied by the different
contributors and when those articles were published.
Figure 3 shows the distributions for the publication years
1975-2005. Watts and Barabási appear to have many
recent articles in their bibliography files. Contractor also
supplied a large number of articles yet they are more
spread out across the years.

The node with the highest degree denotes Jeong, who coauthored with 25 other authors in this data set. The coauthorship with the highest weight denoting a large
number of co-authorships is between Dorogovtsev and
Mendes who have co-authored 29 papers in this data set.

5. Data Analysis and Visualization
Diverse exporting routines were written to export
data in a format suitable for different data analysis and
visualization
tools
such
as
the
InfoVis
Cyberinfrastructure (http://iv.slis.indiana.edu/), Geomi
[1] a graph analysis and visualization tool that can be
used to layout graphs in 2D or 3D, and Pajek [5] an
analysis and drawing tools for large networks.

Figure 6 (left) shows a Geomi force-directed, 2-D
single layer layout of all authors with two or more
articles and their co-authorships. The size of a node is
based on the number of articles by that author. Its color
denotes the node degree – red for nodes with degree 10
and higher, green for 5-9 links, blue for 2-4 links, and
black for one or zero degree nodes. The width of the
edge is based on the number of co-authorships. Nodes
for authors with article count 10 or higher are labeled
with the author’s name. The author with the most papers
is Leydesdorff. Assuming that all contributors submitted
a large majority if not all of their own articles, this is
particularly impressive as Leydesdorff’s free text
bibliography was not included due to parsing problems.
Other authors with a large number of articles include two
of the contributors: Barabási and Newman.

Figure 6: Co-author network of authors with two or more articles (left) and co-authorship network of authors who have
written at least 2 papers together (right).
As expected, there is a correlation between the
number of papers written and the number of coauthorships. However, there are also many authors that
write papers with little or no collaboration. These are
identified by the big black nodes. There are also cases of
authors who have written few papers with several
authors. These are identified by the high degree nodes
that are small such as the red clusters towards the top of
Figure 6 (left).
Figure 6 (right) shows the co-authorship network of
all those authors that have written at least two papers
together. As a result, 1,064 authors are shown. For a
node to have a label in the visualization, the author must
have published at least 10 papers. Exactly 129 scholars
make this threshold. In this visualization, node size is
used to indicate the number of articles and edge
thickness indicates the number of papers coauthored.
Figure 7 shows the complete co-author network with
triads and diads removed rendered in Pajek. Each
component is given in a different color. All 579 authors
are shown. Nodes with high BC value are denoted by a
black outer ring. The giant component is colored in
purple.
Figure 8 shows the 131 authors in the giant
component of the co-authorship network using the same
node positions as in Figure 7. Nodes and edges are
colored based on time. See legend for details.

5.2 Comparing and Mapping Experts Based on
Personal Bibliographies Expert Network
Given the personal bibliography files of seven major
expert contributors, we were interested to analyze and
map the coverage and semantic overlap of these experts
based in the number of shared articles.
Figure 9 shows a network of all seven experts. Each
node represents one of the contributors, labeled by its
name and the number of articles supplied in parentheses.
The size of each node corresponds to the number of
articles contributed by this expert.
There is an edge between two experts if there is at
least one article common to both experts. As for this
dataset we have a fully connected network. The width of
an edge denotes the number of articles common to both
experts. The network was laid out in a 2D circular layout
using Pajek.
As can be seen, Watts and Contractor contributed
the most articles via their bibliography files. Watts and
Barabási have the most articles in common while
Contractor and Thelwall have the least in common with
all other authors.
We hope this new approach to mapping scientific
domains but also to mapping the coverage and overlap of
experts will be widely adopted such that expert network
visualizations can be generated for more than seven
nodes. It might be truly exciting to see the network of all
of science mapped this way.

Conclusions
The paper introduced a novel way of identifying a
comprehensive collection of articles from a field of
science based on personal bibliography data. The
technique
was
demonstrated
in
the
highy
interdisciplinary field of ‘network science’ resulting in
maps of network science authors and experts.
The presented technique can easily be applied to
other domains of science. It has proven to be a fast way
of collecting large amounts of bibliography data. In fact,
it could provide a viable means to collect data required
for analyzing and mapping all of science.
Obviously, the collected data does not provide any
information on paper citation linkages. However, perfect
bibliography data – supplied by hundreds and thousands
of experts and integrated using automatic techniques –
constitutes great raw material to query other databases
such as Schoolar.Google, Citeseer, etc. for citation
linkages and citation counts.
We are in the process of setting up a web portal
interface at http://scimaps.org that experts from diverse
communities can use to upload personal bibliography
files. In return, they will be able to download all unique
articles submitted so far in EndNote, ISI, or bibtex
format; retrieve simple statistics such as the number of
articles per year or the top ten authors, papers, or
journals; as well as co-authorship maps based on shared
bibliographic entries.
