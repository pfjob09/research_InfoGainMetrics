Abstract
This paper illustrates how to clarify a new research
topic – knowledge visualization – in terms of analyzing a
vast amount of citations related to this field. The study
presents a method that may help scholars who are
interested in an inter-disciplinary and not-well-understood
research area, such as knowledge visualization by
revealing for them the underlying disciplines that a
particular research is based upon. Key papers relevant to
the research in question are also identified that may help
researchers gain an overview of the field. The method
discussed in this paper is generic in nature and generally
applicable to other research topics.

1. Introduction
Knowledge visualization has been defined [1] as a new
scientific discipline that examines the use of visual
representations to improve the transfer of knowledge
between at least two persons, or group of persons. SemNet
[2] is a knowledge visualization system that represents
elements of a Prolog rules knowledge base as labeled
rectangles connected by lines or colored arcs, which may
produce 3D graphic representations of large knowledge
bases to help users comprehend complex relationships
among rules. The study of knowledge domain visualization
aims to improve the understanding of the development of a
knowledge domain through a study of its quantitative and
qualitative properties [3]. Knowledge domains are
represented collectively by articles of a designated research
area. Knowledge domain visualization uses citation and cocitation analysis techniques to recognize patterns that may
represent research specialties or intellectual groups [3].
There seems no consensus among researchers in terms of
how to define the context and content of knowledge
visualization research. We describe an approach to uncover
the context and content of a relatively new research

discipline, knowledge visualization in this case, through
analyzing the literature and citations in this domain.

2. Related works
An extensive domain analysis of the information
science discipline has been presented in terms of its authors
[4] . In this study, the names of those most frequently cited
authors in 12 key journals from 1972 through 1995 were
retrieved from the Social SciSearch via DIALOG. The top
120 authors were analyzed via author co-citation analyses,
which yielded automatic classifications relevant to
histories the field. The paper’s results revealed two
interesting aspects of the knowledge visualization field: (1)
the specialty structure of the discipline over 24 years; (2)
evidence of a paradigm shift in information science during
this period. However, the study only selected a list of key
journals, 12 in this case. The study may have presented a
different picture had it included most, if not all, the
representative publications in this field.
In order to better understand the topic of knowledge
domain, Garfield [5] created a series of databases related to
knowledge domains from searches of the ISI citation
indexes (SCI, SSCI, and AHCI). The data collected are
applied to generate chronological maps of subject
collections by using a software package called HistCite,
which also highlights the most-cited works in and outside
the data collected. Garfield conducted a general search for
papers on “Knowledge and Domain” via Web of Science
and found 280 papers with the keywords “Knowledge” and
“Domain” in the title. The citation metrics of these 280
papers were tabulated based on their global citation counts
and local citation counts, local counts representing the
number of citations a paper received from the 280 papers.
The global count is the overall number of times an article is
cited by other papers. Garfield illustrates the problem of
conducting a search based solely on the terms “knowledge”
and “domain” because only 8 papers were cited locally
three or more times in a collection of 280 papers. The most

cited paper by the local collection of 280 papers was
published in the Review of Educational Research in 1988;
the title of the article is “The Interaction of DomainSpecific and Strategic Knowledge in Academic
Performance”. Garfield therefore concluded the terms used
in this search are inadequate to the task and expanded the
terms employed in subsequent searches. In order to capture
literature relevant to the “mapping of knowledge domains,”
five different data sets covering the topics of Information
Visualization,
Dynamic
Systems,
Co-Citation,
Bibliographic Coupling, and Scientometrics (the journal)
were adopted to collect data sets and the resulting data
were merged to create a multi-domain collection. About
3,600 papers were pruned out from approximately 6,000
papers based on citation and other criteria. The two most
cited papers among these 3,600 were two books discussing
the issue of visual display and information envisioning
authored by Edward Turfe. The papers’ collection resulting
from this expanded search includes articles authored by
Small (co-citation analysis) and Kessler (bibliographic
coupling). The key issue of Garfield’s approach is finding
a set of subject terms that fully cover the initial key terms –
“Knowledge Domain” in this case.
Chen and Paul [6] proposed a four-step procedure to
visualize a knowledge domain’s intellectual structure. First,
authors whose work has received citations above a
predetermined threshold are selected. The co-citation
frequencies for these authors are calculated from a citation
database and stored in a frequencies matrix. A correlation
matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients is computed
from the matrix of co-citation frequencies. Second,
Pathfinder network scaling [7] is applied to the network
that the correlation matrix defines. Third, factor analysis is
used to identify intellectual grouping which is then
overlaid to the interconnectivity structure obtained in step
two. Authors belonging to the same specialty should
appear as a closely connected group in the network. Finally,
the citation impact of each author is displayed atop the
intellectual groupings. The height of a citation bar
represents the magnitude of the impact. In Chen and Paul’s
study, a collection of 10,292 articles in IEEE Computer
Graphics and Applications magazine for a period of 18
years were used to illustrate this four-step process. Three
hundred and fifty three authors received more than five
citations in this collection, and these were used to build up
the author co-citation network which was stored as a 353
by 353 matrix. 28,638 arcs in the original citation network
were scaled down to 355 arcs by applying Pathfinder
network scaling. This type of procedure is universally
applicable in identifying specialties from co-citation data.
However, the specialties identified with this procedure
need to be decoded and elaborated by human readers. The
citation data sources are pre-selected from established
sources which may not include all important data sources.
It could be argued that the five citations threshold, used in
pruning out insignificant authors, is selected rather

IEEE

arbitrarily and this may induce bias in the derived
intellectual structure. The computational complexity of the
Pathfinder network is O(N2) [7] which in practice limits the
scale of the co-citation matrix to a few hundreds.

3. Uncovering the latent underlying domains
of a research field
3.1. The scheme
We applied the pruning scheme developed by Chen
and Xie [8] on a complete data set collected from the
CiteSeer citation index system [9]. The pruning method,
which consists of two steps, is used to trim the complete
citation graph. One threshold value is selected and applied
in each step respectively. The first step filters out all the
nodes with the in-degree value less than the first threshold
value. The purpose of the first step is to build the highly
cited initial core set of nodes. The second step checks the
in-degree value of the nodes of those papers that are citing
or being cited by the papers in the initial core set. Those
papers with an in-degree value higher than the second
threshold will be added to the initial core set. The
procedure terminates when all the nodes in the core set are
processed and no new nodes can be added to the core set.
The complete citation graph was built from the literature
retrieved by querying the term “Knowledge Visualization”
from CiteSeer on October 20, 2005. The complete graph
contains 191,357 document nodes and 394,621 citation
arcs.
Two iterations of pruning that use two different sets of
threshold values are carried out in this study to reveal the
research context of knowledge visualization with finer
granularities. The application of different threshold values
in this process is meant to prune out less cited articles with
ascending thresholds, which in turn breaks up a crammed
graph into a number of disjoined weak components. A
weak component in the graph is considered a distinct
research topic that provides supporting knowledge or
relevant information to the designated research domain.
This procedure helps us visually uncover the underlying
contexts of the domain. Two value sets (90, 45), and (180,
90) are used in the experiment discussed in the following
section.

3.2. Experiments
The citation graph results were derived by applying
the threshold values of 90 and 45, as shown in Figure 1
below. The nodes with yellow color represent authoritative
sources [10]. The red-colored nodes stand for hubs. Green
represents nodes that play a dual role as the authority and
hub. The size of nodes signifies the relative importance of
an authoritative article. There are 176 document nodes and
442 links in Figure 1. The 8 most authoritative papers in

Figure 1 are listed in Table 1. There are four disjoined
weak components in Figure 1, these components and their
corresponding papers are listed in Table 2.

The two most cited papers in table 1 are papers in
the data mining field that discuss the effective algorithms
for mining association rules from large databases. The
paper ranked number 3 and 4 are in the field of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and they discuss the KL-One
knowledge representation system and frame-based
descriptive system respectively. Three of the four
remaining papers are AI related articles; the one paper
left discusses mining association rules.

Three papers out of four listed under component one
in table 2 discuss the graphical fisheye views. Articles in
component two are all in the fields related to
visualization, which include user interface design, visual
information seeking, and the graphical visualization of
databases. Papers in component three were published in
Machine Learning and equivalent journals, they are AI
related papers. Papers in component four characterized
recent developments in the area of Ontology related
studies.

The citation graph resulted from applying the
threshold values of 180 and 90 is shown in Figure 2
above. There are 37 document nodes and 51 citation arcs
in Figure 2. The three most authoritative/cited papers,
interestingly, are all papers in the data mining field that
discuss the effective algorithms for mining association
rules from large databases. We therefore conclude that
the most researched area related to knowledge
visualization is data mining.
There are four disjoined weakly connected
components in Figure 2: (1) component with node
number 33, 18, and 19; (2) component with node 13 and
14; (3) component with node 34 and 35; and (4)
component with node 36 and 37. Based on Chen and Xie
[8], these weak components may represent research
focuses which diverge from the main research theme –
mining association rules. Component one includes papers
in the research field of artificial intelligence. Articles and
books in component two discuss the visualization of
information. Papers and books in component three
discuss data clustering and pattern classification.
Component four includes two papers discussing the issue
of efficient multidimensional data aggregation, which is
a very important issue for OLAP applications. As we can
see, papers in these four components belong to four
distinct research fields that are all related to the study of
knowledge visualization.

3.3. Documents similarity analysis
The documents belong to the same disjoin
component are dealing with the same or a closely related
research topic. Chen and Xie [8] proposed this intuitive
appealing argument above without further explanation.
We bolster this argument by applying document
similarity function [11] to validate the argument that the
content similarity implies research fields proximity. We
use the most cited document listed in Table 1 as the basis
for comparison with other documents listed in Table 2.
Documents are included in the comparison if they are
available from CiteSeer. Titles in component 0 are
equivalent to papers listed in Table 1, other component
numbers correspond to that of Table 2. The result is
listed in the table below:

The similarity scores are calculated by a home
grown similarity analysis system based on Lucene [12],
which is an open source implementation of the TF×IDF
similarity function. The closer the score, the more similar
these documents are. We can see from Table 3 that all
documents are clustered together based on their
similarity scores except one document in component
three. Comparable results have been observed if a
document from a different component is chosen as the
basis for comparison. A score is calculated from four
portions of a paper: title, abstract, keyword, and content.

4. Discussions
The high thresholds we have applied help us to
discover the most researched topics with a general query
term. However, a newer research context may be filtered
out by this process due to infrequent citation. Fewer
citations are generally received by literature published
recently. Conversely, a mature research area may also be
filtered out due to sporadic citation. We compared the
data resulted from the two different sets of threshold
values and summarized the findings: (1) the main
research theme seems stable and stayed on data mining
related issues; (2) mature research topics such as fisheye
view lens was filtered out by the higher threshold values;
(3) relative newer research areas like ontology was
uncovered by lower threshold values; (4) evolutionary
research areas such as visualization stayed on a evolving
course.
To elaborate the findings discussed above, we use
the research of fisheye view as an illustrative example. A
fisheye view lens is a very wide angle lens that magnifies
nearby objects while shrinking distant objects [13]. It is a
helpful tool for seeing both “local detail” and “global
context” simultaneously. The early research in fisheye
views was adopted widely, and it is commonly used in

the visualization field nowadays. The fact that the
fisheye view lens is a general tool and no longer a
research topic, which may explain the reason why papers
in this field were cited less frequently in recent years and
were filtered out by applying higher threshold values.
The in-degree and out-degree distribution of the
nodes in the citation graph follow the power-law
distribution [14]. The threshold values could be set as the
function of the power-law curve of the in-degree
distribution of the citation graph [8]. For example, the
first threshold is set as the value x1 where the cumulative
probability distribution function of the power-law curve
P(x1) = 0.25%. The second threshold should be set with
higher cumulative probability value, such as x2 where
P(x2) = 1%. Currently, there is no definite guideline for
choosing the threshold values. However, there is a
general guideline that may be followed: (1) the
difference between threshold values in a set should be
significant enough; and (2) sets with significantly
different threshold values should be applied to enabling
the display of graphs with varying granularities.

5. Conclusions
[8]
The context and content of the study of knowledge
visualization are not well understood due to disagreeing
definitions or propositions from different scholars. The
diverse views of this research field may be clarified by
analyzing the vast citation information available in this
field. The procedure we have applied uncovered the
underpinning disciplines of the research field of
knowledge visualization, which include knowledge
representation, data mining, graphical user interface,
information visualization, graph visualization, data
clustering, and, more recently, studies in Ontology. In
addition, out-of-favored research due to maturation or
other reasons as well as new research subjects can be
identified due to their relatively infrequent citations. The
procedure we have devised is generally applicable in
clarifying research domains and their underlying
supporting domains. Unlike other approaches reviewed
earlier, there are little prerequisites or limitation in
effectively utilizing this procedure.
