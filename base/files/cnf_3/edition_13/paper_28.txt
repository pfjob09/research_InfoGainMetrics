found to be necessary not only by the cost and the
period of production but by some other performance
evaluators such as the value chain analysis method
which can expect synergy of each application.
In this research, designers mainly produced the

such as the Ministry of Construction in Japan, to deal
with FAA by themselves since the keyword
