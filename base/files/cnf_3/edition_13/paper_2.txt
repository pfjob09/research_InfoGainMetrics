ABSTRACT
The OPTICAL project is a multidisciplinary effort in the Computer Science, Division and
School of Optometry. “OPTICAL” is an acronym for “OPtics and Topography Involving the
Cornea And Lens”. This project is concerned with the measurement, modeling,
reconstruction, and visualization of the shape of the human cornea.
The cornea is the clear fibrous tissue forming the front surface of the eye. Its shape is very
important in determining visual acuity. The shape is also important for fitting contact lenses
and performing cornea1 refractive surgery.
To recover the shape of the cornea, clinicians use one of several commercially available
cornea1 topography instruments known as videokeratographs. These devices project a pattern
onto the cornea and record the reflected image. The image is then analyzed to recover the
shape information.
We have developed a new analysis algorithm that has several advantages compared to
current approaches: it is more accurate, it directly recovers position of the cornea, and it
produces a continuous map over the entire surface. To develop this algorithm, we have
assimilated ideas from a variety of fields, including ray-tracing (computer graphics and optics),
smooth B-spline surfaces (geometric modeling) and simulation.
This algorithm for accurately measuring the cornea is an essential first step in the scientific
visualization of cornea1 topography. After measuring the shape of the cornea, it is important to
be able to display the results in a manner that highlights the important features of the surface
and is understandable to viewers with a wide variety of backgrounds. We have developed
new scientific visualization approaches which overcome some of the shortcomings of the
displays used in current cornea1 topography instruments.
