ABSTRACT
W
We present a custom visual analytics systeem developed in
cconjunction with
h the test and evaluation

comm
munity of the US
U
A
Army. We desiigned and impllemented a visu
ual programmin
ng
eenvironment forr configuring a variety of interactive

visu
ual
aanalysis capabiliities. Our abstraction of the visu
ualization proceess
iss based on insights gained from interviews cond
ducted with expeert
uusers. We show that this modeel allowed analy
ysts to implemeent
m
multiple visual analysis capabiilities for netw
work performancce,
aanomalous senso
or activity, and
d engagement reesults. Long-terrm
innteraction with expert

users led to development of several custo

with expert userss, and are workiing to evaluate the
t success of our

P RODV DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTTATION

Users of our system required the abbility to importt data from
differennt sources and innteractively expllore data within coordinated
multiplle view (CMV
V) visualizationss. Our design framework,
which we refer to ass the Process-O
Oriented Data V
Visualization
(ProDV
V) framework, is based on a simple abstracction of the
visualizzation process thhat can be repressented visually aand is easily
understtood by domain experts. Becausse early intervieews revealed
that doomain experts were not fam
miliar with coomputational
algorithhms or complex data structures, the framework components
we defi
fine in our abstraaction are basedd on a simplifiedd conceptual
model of the visualizzation process as compared w
with formal
referennce models thatt have been deefined in the vvisualization
commuunity [1-3]. A coonceptual diagram
m of our framew
work and the
interacttive visual repreesentation is show
wn in Figure 1.

U SE CASES

3.1
Network Ana
alysis
To enaable visual analyysis of network performance, w
we provided
data im
mporters for Acccess, SQL, text, and PCAP dataa sources, as
well ass data operators for accessing packet data of vaarious types,
parsingg date/time and IIP address inform
mation from texxt, and filters
removiing erroneous or irrelevant values. The interactive
visualizzations used inn these examplees include a linne graph, a
stackedd bar graph, a pparallel coordinaate plot, and a radial chart
based oon the Radial Traaffic Analyzer [44].
The visualization shhown in Figure 2 provides interaactive zoom
and fiilter operations with details provided by mouse-over
interacttions. After inittial training, anaalysts were ablee to use the
visualizzation to recognnize expected datta features such as dominant
senderss and receivers of data withinn various segm
ments of the

nnetwork. Subseq
quently analysts were able to quickly
q
recognize
ddeviations from the
t expected netw
work profile.

allows the user to visuualize the persppective of a speccific player.
Only oone perspective ccan be displayedd at a time, andd the display
shows tthe perceived annd actual positionns. The examplee in Figure 4
shows a low point of C
COP currency forr a particular plaayer.

owed analysts to

s

Engagement dataa from simulateed kinetic engag
gements involvin
ng
ddirect force, succh as firing weeapons, was useed in our secon
nd
eexample. We provided multi-dimension
m
al visualizatio
on
ccapabilities in th
he form of a parrallel coordinatee plot and a radiial
cchart depicting the weapon, shooter, and target of eacch
eengagement. Inteeresting behavio
ors became easily
y detectable usin
ng
thhis analysis tecchnique. For ex
xample, when simulation playeers
w
were colored acccording to their affiliation, frien
ndly fire inciden
nts
w
were easily disceerned. Analysts also used the parallel
p
coordinaate
pplot to validate expected results for
f different weaapon types.
We provided a spatial visualization of non-kinetic interactions
ssuch as message transmissions between
b
nodes. This visualizatio
on
pprovided the cap
pability to view where certain expected netwo
ork
innteractions took
k place. The ex
xample in Figurre 3 was used to
cconduct detailed message thread analysis.

Sensor Perfo
ormance Analy
ysis
We deeveloped severaal visual analysis methods for identifying
anomallies and conductting detailed anaalysis of sensor pperformance
by com
mbining traditionnal and new tecchniques. Using the custom
techniqque shown in Fiigure 5, analystss were able to eeasily detect
anomallous temporal seensor patterns frrom large dataseets involving
multiplle spatial sensorrs recorded overr multiple days. Additional
analysiis techniques eenabled the iddentification of anomalous
spatial sensor data and data collection eerrors.

C ONCLUSION

We havve shown how P
ProDV has beenn designed and ddeveloped to
supportt multiple analyysis modes withiin a specific com
mmunity via
severall distinct use ccases. We receently implemennted several
collaboorative analysis features includiing annotations and content
sharingg, and are continnuing our work bby evaluating thhe long-term
effectivveness of using tthis approach too enable collaborrative visual
analysiis activities within this communiity.
