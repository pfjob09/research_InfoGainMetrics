A BSTRACT
Existing research suggests that individual personality differences
can influence performance with visualizations. In addition to stable
traits such as locus of control, research in psychology has found
that temporary changes in affect (emotion) can significantly impact individual performance on cognitive tasks. We examine the
relationship between fundamental visual judgement tasks and affect through a crowdsourced user study that combines affectivepriming techniques from psychology with longstanding graphical
perception experiments. Our results suggest that affective-priming
can significantly influence accuracy in visual judgements, and that
some chart types may be more affected than others.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Effective analytical reasoning involves many cognitive subprocesses including memory, attention, learning, judgement, creativity, decision-making, and problem-solving. Interestingly, recent
research in psychology has explored the extent to which emotion,
even if short-lived, can significantly influence many of these abilities. For instance, performance on attention tasks are significantly
impacted when emotion-inducing stimuli precedes the task [8].
In general, this technique of inducing emotion in human subjects
is referred to as affective-priming. Based on research from psychology, we know that affective-priming influences cognitive and perceptual ability across various tasks. Coincidentally, in visualization
and visual analytics, recent research has identified a close relationship between a user’s cognitive abilities with the user’s ability to
perceive and understand information in visualizations [1] [3]. It appears that there could be a connection between the two. However,
how affective-priming may influence a user’s ability to perceive information in a visualization has not been a explored by researchers
in visualization and visual analytics.
We note that there are many challenges for designing a controlled
study for both affect and graphical perception individually, and even
more so when combined. We handle these issues primarily by following previous graphical perception studies and using validated
affective-priming techniques, as well as by increasing the scale of
our study through crowdsourcing.
2 E XPERIMENT
To test how affect influences graphical perception, we conducted
a large-scale experiment using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. We
follow Heer-Bostock’s crowdsourced replication of ClevelandMcGill’s seminal study on graphical perception [2] [4], making
necessary changes to effectively incorporate affective priming.
In a pilot study, we tested an initial hypothesis that charts that
showed less error in Cleveland-McGill’s study would be less influenced by affective-priming, and that charts ranked as more difficult
would be more influenced. Based on this pilot, in which all charts
were affected for successful primes in the intended direction (positive or negative), we formed the following hypothesis: Successful
affective-priming will significantly influence error across all chart
types.

Following previous affective-priming experiments [7], we evaluated several short stories found in the New York Times website
for their emotional content. We chose two stories, one negative and
one positive. These stories were validated as having the intended
effect through an additional pilot study.
We chose the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale for testing
the valence and arousal of the participant. The SAM scale is widely
used in psychology, and is also well-suited for Mechanical Turk [6].
2.1

Participants

We recruited 963 participants through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
system. It took a approximately 5 days to gather all responses. Our
study used a total of 8 charts, and with the two priming groups
(positive/negative) an average of 60 participants were assigned to
each chart and priming type. After completing the study, participants were initially paid $0.20, which was later increased to $0.35
to speed completion time.
Participants were first given the SAM scale as a pre-test to record
their valence and arousal. Next, participants were given the positive
or negative story to read with the instructions that “the overall story
is more important than the details”. After reading was complete,
participants were asked a simple verification question regarding the
content of the story (the story was hidden at this point). Next, participants began the graphical perception task.
Each of the five charts (all being the same type: bar, pie, or one
of the others) were presented in random order. Participants were
instructed to make quick but accurate visual judgements, and to
avoid using any outside tools. Similar to Heer-Bostock’s study, participants were asked the following two questions about the charts:
First, “Which of the two (A or B) is SMALLER?” followed by
“What percentage is the SMALLER of the LARGER?”.
After the graphical perception tasks were completed, participants
were given the SAM again as a post-test. Finally, they were invited
to submit any additional comments about the task.
2.2

Results

Our study adhered to a between-subjects design, since participants
were given a single chart and priming combination. We excluded
participants who incorrectly answered the story verification question, as well as those who either failed to answer or put the same
answer for multiple questions (i.e. putting 50% for each judgement). In total, 299 of the 963 participants were removed. We note
that the large amount of participants removed was due to the factors we used to ensure quality responses and to facilitate successful
priming, mitigation techniques are discussed further in [4].
In our analysis we include those who were succesfully primed in
the intended negative or positive direction. Specifically, we include
those whose post-valence is higher than pre-valence for the positive group, and vice-versa for the negative group. Specifically, we
include those whose post-valence is higher than pre-valence for the
positive group, and vice-versa for the negative group. This resulted
in 87 participants in the positive condition and 120 in the negative
condition for a total of n = 197. There was an average of 13 participants for a single chart+priming condition (out of 16 total possible
combinations). As stated before, each participant made judgements
on 5 charts. Therefore, this analysis consists of approximately 985
individual judgements. These results are shown in figure 2.

The main finding of this work is that affective priming can influence
graphical perception. This was accomplished through a large-scale
crowdsourced study. Our results suggest that there are significant
differences in graphical perception ability for positive and negative affective-primes, and that positive priming tends to increase
graphical perception ability, rather than negative priming decreasing ability. We hope these findings serve as a step forward in better
understanding the cognitive aspects related to visualization.

Following Hullman et al., we also take the results for all charts
in each priming group together, including all chart error scores for
each participant in the negative- and positive- primed groups [5].
We then compare positive error with negative error using a t-test.
This yields a signficant effect for error t(205) = 3.1560, p = .0018,
with error in the negative group being higher than that of the positive group. The lowest error appeared in the positive group (M =
2.42, SD = 1.47), meaning participants in the positive group performed better on graphical perception tasks than those in the negative group (M = 3.05, SD = 1.49) (see figure 3). These results
are consistent with our hypothesis that affective-priming can significantly impact graphical perception performance in participants
who report delta in valence scores.
