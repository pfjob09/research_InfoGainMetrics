A BSTRACT
FinVis is a visual analytics tool that allows the non-expert casual
user to interpret the return, risk and correlation aspects of financial data and make personal finance decisions. This interactive
exploratory tool helps the casual decision-maker quickly choose
between various financial portfolio options and view possible outcomes. FinVis allows for exploration of inter-temporal data to analyze outcomes of short-term or long-term investment decisions.
FinVis helps the user overcome cognitive limitations and understand the impact of correlation between financial instruments in order to reap the benefits of portfolio diversification. Because this
software is accessible by non-expert users, decision-makers from
the general population can benefit greatly from using FinVis in
practical applications. We quantify the value of FinVis using experimental economics methods and find that subjects using the FinVis
software make better financial portfolio decisions as compared to
subjects using a tabular version with the same information. We also
find that FinVis engages the user, which results in greater exploration of the dataset and increased learning as compared to a tabular
display. Further, participants using FinVis reported increased confidence in financial decision-making and noted that they were likely
to use this tool in practical application.

I NTRODUCTION

Financial planning is a challenging process in which the decisionmaker must consider abstract and dynamic concepts such as risk
and correlation of financial instruments. Empirical and laboratory
research in economics and finance has shown that individuals often make sub-optimal decisions when choosing a financial portfolio
due to cognitive limitations [3, 14, 22, 23, 38]. Critical problems
faced by individuals are finding the right investment and optimally
allocating investments. Optimal asset allocation is often the most
important decision for a portfolio’s performance [3].
American workers are increasingly responsible for their own retirement; therefore, it is important to have a successful financial
plan and to select a suitable portfolio of investments. However, a
recent study found that less than 25% of individuals over the age
of 50 succeeded at saving for retirement, often because they were
unaware of fundamental economic concepts such as interest rate
or inflation [24]. Here success at saving is defined as simply developing and following through with a financial plan. Researchers
have called for the development of decision support systems to aid
individuals in understanding financial planning [3]. Systems with
textual feedback and graphs can improve decision making in simple
tasks [3]. However, visual analytics tools are needed for complex

decision-making involving long-term investment planning. Further,
these tools must be accessible to the casual user. For this purpose
we have developed FinVis, a visual analytics tool that allows the casual untrained user to easily assess and explore information about
potential life-long impacts of many financial decisions simultaneously and interactively.
Our key contribution is a visual analytics tool, FinVis, that helps
the individual improve decision-making by visualizing aggregate
risk alongside a traditional wealth-time plot in a casual context for
personal finance data. Since this software is accessible to nonexpert users, general users can benefit greatly from using FinVis in
practical applications. FinVis allows the user to evaluate potential
long-term outcomes of multiple decisions.
The improved decision making that resulted from using FinVis
in an laboratory setting suggests that the use of these techniques in
practice could improve the ability of the general public to allocate
finances in an appropriate manner. The economic experiment presented allows us to compare decisions made in a financial planning
task for a group using FinVis versus a group using a tool with textual representations of the same data. Laboratory experiments such
as this one are ideal for explaining decision-making and quantifying
the value of visual analytics techniques [29]. We find that FinVis
improves decision-making, learning, and exploration of the dataset,
and increases users’ confidence.

WORK IN

V ISUALIZATION

FinVis builds on work from several key research areas, including
visual analytics [29], financial visualization [4, 27, 33, 39], casual
information visualization [28], temporal visualization [16], and visualization of risk [7, 30, 39]. While use of computer-assisted visualization techniques to show financial data goes back many years,
these tools were designed for expert users.
FinVis can be described as a casual information visualization
tool as it provides a simple and powerful visualization for the nonexpert user. Here the casual, non-expert user is any individual who
is not a professional in the field of finance. The goal of casual information visualization is to spread the benefits of visualization to
the general public [11, 28, 34, 37]. One of the biggest challenges in
making this transition is making the interface and visual metaphors
simple and intuitive enough that the average user would require little training.
Visual analytics has previously been applied to economic
decision-making problems, resulting in decisions that were closer
to optimal [29]. Similar to this work, FinVis uses visual analytics techniques to visualize risk and uncertainty, and gives users the
ability to explore information related to probable outcomes.
Some initial work in financial visualization centered on the
choice between 2D [19] and 3D [25] representations of the data.
While the 3D format allows for more data dimensions to be shown,
it adds complexity and can make comparisons between data points
difficult, especially for a casual user. The 2D examples also allow
for three dimensions of data, but with one axis over-plotted with
two dimensions’ worth of data. This method works well when one
dimension is relatively small. Because the risk dimension can be
plotted in terms of wealth and is of much smaller magnitude than
net wealth, FinVis opts for the 2D approach.

195

More recently, FINESSE [33], LifeLines [27], Performance Matrix visualization [39], an adaptation of the Bead system [4], and
others [35] have refined both 2D and 3D techniques to ease some of
the drawbacks originally present. These specific solutions are ideal
for expert users. They use more complicated or denser representations of the data that would not be immediately understood by the
general public.
2.1 Temporal Visualization
Of the many methods available for temporal visualization [1], only
a few are appropriate for a casual user. Furthermore, personal financial data as a whole is not generally cyclic, which eliminates some
of the remaining options [6, 36]. In most situations, wealth is accumulated over a certain time span and then depleted during retirement and FinVis makes no attempt to predict market cycles. Finally,
we desire to show the individual contribution of each individual investment over time along with the aggregation of all investments,
which brings us to ThemeRiverTM [16] as the most applicable temporal example.
ThemeRiverTM presents subject magnitude over time. FinVis
parallels this; instead of visualizing theme magnitude, FinVis shows
risk magnitude for financial decisions. Instead of branching from
an axis, however, FinVis will follow the expected wealth curve. In
this manner, a user may instantly see the impact of any decision.
Another key distinction is that ThemeRiverTM does not include a
visualization of uncertainty, which is necessary for FinVis to emphasize the probable outcomes.
2.2 Visualization of Risk
Visualization of financial risk can take many forms. FundExplorer
[7] and G-Sphere [15], for example, visualize the diversification
of mutual funds and other assests. Generally, more diversified investments carry less risk because they are less dependent on any
one sector of the economy. In this sense, these programs visualizes
risk indirectly. They are useful personal finance tools for choosing
carefully among very specific options in the present, but the scope
of FinVis is much broader. FinVis is an exploratory tool that allows
for short and long-term personal finance decision-making.
For direct visualizations of risk, bar charts and confidence intervals have been used to show investment standard deviations or other
measures of risk and can be constructed using spreadsheet programs
like Microsoft Excel [9, 12]. These techniques would be recognizable to most users, but, by themselves, fail to work for our purposes.
Both methods are used to primarily show relative risk between different options. In FinVis, the user must be able to see the aggregate
risk at any time, which is not possible with these paradigms.
To solve these issues, FinVis represents probability with partial transparency. The more likely a given outcome is, the more
opaque it is. This will help focus the user on the most relevant
outcomes. This technique has already been proposed to visualize
expected financial wealth and risk simultaneously [30, 39]. As
used previously, it can show the performance of one investment
well, but does not scale in a useful manner. Combining these visual metaphors with those from ThemeRiverTM by overlaying investments with magnitudes derived from their contribution to the
aggregate risk on top of the risk gradient provides a useful visualization basis for FinVis as seen in Figure 1.

F INANCE

Modern portfolio selection theory has been a significant topic for
research since it was proposed by Markowitz over 50 years ago
[26]. This theory suggests that rational investors should use diversification to optimize their portfolios by maximizing return for any
given level of risk. Investors following this strategy should take into
account standard deviations and correlations in order to choose assets optimally. However, individuals have cognitive limitations and

cannot effectively use this strategy for financial planning, and this
has been discovered in the field [10, 14] and in laboratory experiments [5, 23]. Computerized decision support systems are needed
to improve decision-making in this task [3].
3.1 Decision-Making under Uncertainty
The complexity of information encountered while making financial
decisions may overwhelm the decision-maker, who does not have
unlimited cognitive abilities and is therefore “boundedly rational”
[13, 31]. “Bounded rationality,” or the inability to make optimal decisions, is prevalent in many decision-making problems, including
financial planning problems. Judgment and decision-making literature indicates that when available information is too complex and
uncertain, individuals use heuristics or “rules of thumb” to make
decisions [21, 38]. This kind of decision-making simplifies the
cognitive process, but results in sub-optimal choices that are not
in line with portfolio selection theory. Visual analytics reduces the
complex cognitive work that is needed to perform decision-making
tasks [32]. Savikhin et al. [29] recently found that individuals were
able to make economic decisions that were significantly closer to
the optimal while using an interactive visual analytics tool as compared to having this information in textual form. The implementation of FinVis in financial decision-making is a natural extension
to this area of research. Economics experiments can be used to
quantify the improvement in decision-making attributed to visualization. The use of laboratory experiments to understand decisionmaking is widespread in economics, and these have recently been
implemented to quantify the value of visual analytics techniques for
decision-making [29].
3.2 Overcoming Cognitive Limitations
FinVis is a visual analytics tool that can help individuals overcome
cognitive limitations and reduce the need for heuristics, improving
decision-making. For example, when choosing between n financial
instruments, individuals tend to follow the “framing and diversification” heuristic and allocate 1/n proportion of their wealth to each
instrument, which is not always optimal [3, 14, 17]. FinVis reduces
cognitive costs and reduces the need for this heuristic. Further, due
to “ambiguity aversion,” investors tend to choose an inappropriate
default portfolio without considering options [3]. Choosing one’s
own portfolio helps the individual to identify with the portfolio and
stick to an investment plan [10]. FinVis is an exploratory tool that
mitigates these problems by allowing investors to quickly assess
outcomes of possible portfolio options and choose an appropriate
allocation. This allows individuals to move away from the default
portfolio and successfully identify with their choice. Finally, some
individuals tend to be overconfident compared to their abilities and
after selecting a portfolio would prefer their own portfolio to that of
an expert [10]. These “egocentric biases” can lead to serious misin-

vestments and financial crashes [10]. FinVis improves the choices
of investors by helping them to diversify, thus reducing negative
financial impact of untrained and overconfident investors. Other investors are not confident enough and fail to develop any plan [24].
Graphical representations increase confidence and accuracy [8], so
that through use of FinVis, overconfident individuals may improve
abilities and uncertain individuals may become more confident. Using FinVis helps individuals increase financial knowledge, which is
directly correlated with success in investment planning [24].

the APR (R, displayed as a percentage).

4 F INANCIAL M ODEL I MPLEMENTATION
We use the standard portfolio theory approach to calculate expected
returns, standard deviations, and correlations [20]. The model uses
historic investment return and standard deviation data values as input, as these are the best available predictors of future investments
[20]. Standard deviation is used in this paper as a measure of risk,
as is common in the financial field [26].
4.1 Liquid and Invested Assets
Net wealth can be broken up entirely into liquid assets and invested
assets. FinVis tracks liquid wealth. When an investment is made,
the principal used to make that investment is no longer available for
further investment during that period.
When there is no risk associated with an investment, the principal
is deducted from the liquid assets for the duration of the investment
and subsequently, the principal and earnings are added back in to
the available liquid assets. When risk is a factor, the earnings are no
longer a single possible value. We could choose to be as optimistic
or pessimistic about the return, but the most probable value will
always be the interest without accounting for risk, which is what
FinVis uses.

value of investment diversification, we must account for the change
in risk due to correlations.
The aggregate risk is defined as:

4.2 Interest
We use compound interest when calculating expected returns, using
the following formula:

n

σaggregate =

n

∑ ∑ wi w j σi σ j ci, j

(3)

i=0 j=0

I = P(1 + R)T

(1)

In Equation 1 and subsequently in this paper, I is the interest or
return on investment, P is the principal amount invested, R is the
expected annual return rate, and T is the time elapsed in years since
the initial investment was made. In the FinVis program, R is labeled as “APR” and displayed as a percentage and T is labeled as
“Length.”
4.3 Risk
FinVis displays both individual risk and aggregate risk of investment allocation decisions. FinVis aims to help users improve diversification of portfolios; therefore, the risk discussed here is unsystematic risk, and does not include systematic risk (i.e., recessions,
wars, and so forth) that cannot be diversified away. Risk is shown as
two standard deviations above and below the expected return of the
investment, and returns are normally distributed. FinVis displays
both individual risk (from each investment choice) and the aggregate risk (from the entire portfolio), which results in approximately
a 95% confidence interval and gives the user a very good idea of the
most probable earnings. To account for risk, we modify Equation 1
by either adding or subtracting two standard deviations (2σ ) to the
return. The resulting formula is:
I = P(1 + R ± 2σ )T

(2)

The aggregate risk of n investments also depends on their correlations. For example, when investments are perfectly correlated,
no reduction in risk results from diversification. When those investments are perfectly negatively correlated, one is the complement
of the other, and all risk can be eliminated. In order to show the

V ISUAL & I NTERACTIVE I MPLEMENTATION

5.1 Investment Display & Modification
Each investment is simultaneously shown in two ways: in the table
of all investments (Figure 2(a)) and in the plot window (Figure
2(b)). In the table, the details of each investment are enumerated
and each field is sortable. This display allows the user to quickly
see which investments have the lowest risk or highest principal, for
example. A corresponding visualization marks each investment as
either a ring when unselected or disc when selected. Each marker
is placed at the start year of each investment and at the expected net
wealth value for that year.
Once an investment has been selected from the investments table,
its properties are shown in the modification panel. Figure 3 shows
the panel for the investments in Figure 2 where the selected investment is of Type B. The investment option, principal, and start year
are all editable and may be altered as many times as the user wishes.
For the user study, where all investment options are pre-defined, the
remaining properties are derived from those three. Changes to investment properties immediately update the visualization to allow
for quick exploration.
There are two buttons available between the investment list and
modification panel, labeled as “+” and “-”. The former allows the
user to add a new investment, which is immediately selected. The

197

latter removes the currently selected investment and selects the next
one, if there are any left.

5.2 Visualizing Risk
Risk is shown in two distinct ways. First, the aggregate risk (within
two standard deviations) is displayed as a Gaussian gradient where
darker parts of the gradient represent more probable outcomes.
Since exactly two standard deviations from the mean are always
displayed, the range of intensity values can be precomputed and
converted to a linear scale.
The risk is also displayed on a per-investment basis so that the
user can ascertain each investment’s contribution to the aggregate
risk. Thus, the aggregate risk is divided by linear blue borders as
seen in Figure 2(b). Subsequent investments have their risk contribution displayed closer to the center. The most recent contribution
is in the middle and the least recent has its optimistic range at the
top and its pessimistic on the bottom. Here, optimistic refers to the
positive two standard deviations’ worth of risk, and pessimistic, the
negative.
We provide a formula that satisfies the two necessary conditions for defining the aggregate risk: the sum of all individual risk
must equal the aggregate risk and the proportions must account for
the principal. Larger investments must take up a correspondingly
greater share of the aggregate risk. The formula we derived to satisfy both of these conditions is shown in Equation 4.

σˆi =

(σi / ∑nj=1 σ j )wi

σaggregate

(4)

where σi is the unadjusted standard deviation of the investment
we are calculating the individual risk for and σˆi is the effective
standard deviation accounting for covariance between investments
made in the same year.
5.3 Showing Context
To show the amount remaining to invest, the liquid assets, a partially transparent purple line is plotted on top of the chart1 , as seen
in Figure 2(b) for the investment choices listed in Figure 2(a).
In addition to the selected investment being highlighted in the
table of investments (Figures 2(a), 4(a)), it is also shown as a yellow highlight over the selected investment’s risk contribution (Figures 2(b), 4(c)), which is the area between its upper and lower

boundaries. The user focuses on the highlighted section to easily
see changes as they modify the selected investment.
5.4 Baseline Version
A baseline tabular version of the program was made to be used in
our laboratory experiment. The baseline version presents the same
key information, including aggregate risk, expected wealth, and liquid assets in sortable columns with one row per decision year (Figure 4(b)). The only difference between the baseline program and
FinVis is that the latter also includes visual information of context,
risk gradient, and risk boundaries for each individual investment,
which are derived from the key information. This additional information would be impractical to present in tabular form and thus
must be presented visually. Both versions have identical controls,
capabilities, and investment list displays. A comparison between
versions is shown in Figure 4.

E XPERIMENTAL D ESIGN

6.1 Anticipated Findings
We conjecture that FinVis can help decision-makers in a number of
ways, and we directly tested each of our predictions using a laboratory experiment. Our laboratory experiment consisted of a treatment with subjects making decisions using the FinVis visual analytics application, and a separate baseline treatment with subjects
making decisions using an application with the same information
in tabular form. Our expected findings were:

1. FinVis is a useful visual analytics application that can improve
decision-making by helping subjects choose optimal allocations that maximize return and minimize risk.
2. FinVis engages subjects and subjects using FinVis will choose
to explore the dataset more than their counterparts using the
baseline application. This should lead to greater learning over
time in the FinVis treatment as compared to the baseline.
3. FinVis will increase the confidence of participants in decisionmaking in the experiment and also in practical application.
Increased confidence is positively correlated with the ability
to follow through with a financial plan [24].
6.2 Experimental Setup
Inexperienced undergraduate students from Purdue University volunteered to participate in the study; 27 subjects in total volunteered
2 . Experiments were conducted at the Vernon Smith Experimental Economics Lab using standard laboratory protocols. Subjects
earned between $9 and $18 in the experiment, where their earnings
depended on their choice of investment portfolio. Subjects whose
portfolio choices resulted in higher experiment earnings earned a
greater amount in the experiment as compared to subjects whose
portfolio choices resulted in lower experiment earnings; thus, there
was a high incentive to make good decisions that maximized return
and minimized risk.
We used a between subjects design, with 13 subjects participating in the treatment using FinVis (FV) and 13 different subjects
participating in the baseline treatment (B) using a tabular display
with the same information. The information and training was the
same in both treatments. Self-reported academic majors included
business, engineering, information technology, science, and health
sciences. It is possible that business majors would be likely to perform better in this experiment and that this could account for the
improved performance in FV; however, over half of participants in
B were business majors, while less than one third of participants
in FV were business majors. About 60% of participants were male
and 40% were female, with the same proportion in each treatment.
The average age of participants was 21, and most participants were
between age 18 and 23, with the same approximate ages in both
treatments. None of the demographic characteristics had a statistically significant effect on subjects’ decisions.
While FinVis is capable of allowing an arbitrary number of investments, we provided subjects with four generic investments, A,
B, C, and D with returns and standard deviations of 3%, 5%, 7%,
2% and 3%, 6%, 12%, 0%, respectively to align with previous work
[23]. The correlation between B and C was -0.8, while all other correlations between investments were 0. Correlation between i and j,
ρi, j , is defined as:

ρi, j =

σi, j
σi σ j

(5)

where σi is the standard deviation of investment i, σ j is the standard deviation of investment j, and σi, j is the covariance between
i and j. Covariance is the extent to which the investments covary,
and is defined as:
m

σi, j =

∑

Ri,k − E(Ri ) R j,k − E(R j )]

(6)

k=1

where Ri,k is one possible return on security i, E(Ri ) is the expected value on security i, and m is the number of likely outcomes
for a security for the period.
2 1/27 subjects did not successfully complete the pre-experiment task and
did not participate in the full experiment

Each subject had 3 years (2020, 2021, and 2022) in which to
make allocation decisions. We chose years far in the future in an
attempt to keep the current financial situation from influencing the
controlled laboratory experiment. Three decision years were used
because this gives subjects the opportunity to plan for the future.
While we could have allowed decisions further into the future in
order to make the experiment more akin to a retirement planning
task, we feel that this would have complicated the experiment without providing further information about decision-making. In order
to allow for learning, the decision task was repeated for 6 periods;
thus, subjects made decisions in 3 decision years and this was repeated for 6 different periods. After each period, an outcome was
randomly selected according to the resulting Gaussian distribution
at the end of the final decision year and reported to the subject. At
the end of the experiment, random numbers were drawn to determine which period was to be paid. Only 2 periods were paid, which
is a common practice in economic experiments [18]. Subjects received a $1,000 experimental dollar endowment at the start of each
period, and were paid for the profit earned after returning the initial
endowment to the experimenter. Experimental dollars were converted to U.S. dollars at the rate of $100 experimental dollars to $1
U.S. dollar.
Subjects could make any number of decisions for each year when
choosing to allocate the $1,000 experimental dollar endowment.
For example, subjects could either make one decision in each year
and allocate the full endowment to one of the four investments,
or subjects could make multiple decisions in each year, allocating
fractions of the endowment to any or all of the investment choices.
Subjects were told that they could add, remove, or modify investment decisions as many times as they desired, and subjects moved
through the experiment at their own pace. The program recorded
both the final choices made, the time taken for each period, and
the number of times investments were added, removed, or edited.
These latter measurements help us understand to what extent exploration of the dataset occurred.
6.3 Training, Risk and Confidence Elicitation
Before the beginning of the experiment, subjects also received a
short training on reading the information screen presented by FinVis. Subjects participating in the baseline treatment received a short
training on reading the tabular information screen. The training
took approximately 30 minutes for both treatments, and included
descriptions of the components of the program and a tutorial.
A simple quiz was administered in which subjects were given a
static information screen similar to the one presented in each treatment and asked to answer 3 questions about the screen to gauge
subjects’ basic understanding. This quiz was not difficult and did
not require exploration of data. Subjects who did not answer all
questions correctly were asked to leave and did not participate in the
experiment. This minimal requirement ensured that only subjects
who paid attention to instructions and knew how to read a table or a
graph participated in the experiment. Fourteen subjects participated
in the FinVis treatment, and 13/14 completed the quiz successfully.
Thirteen subjects participated in the baseline treatment, and 13/13
completed the quiz successfully.
Prior to the experiment, we elicited subjects’ objective risk preferences using a simple lottery task commonly used in economics
experiments [18]. Fifteen lottery choices were presented and subjects were asked their preference for the safe option versus the gamble. In this task, subjects often choose the safe option in lotteries
with a greater chance of loss and choose the gamble in lotteries
with a lower chance of loss. Subjects who choose the safe option
more often are considered risk averse, while subjects who choose
the gamble more often are considered risk loving. At the end of
the experiment, one of the lotteries was selected for payment - subjects earned between $0 and $3 in this task. We also asked a risk

preference question commonly used in behavioral finance to elicit
subjective risk tolerance - this question asked subjects to decide
whether they would take a gamble to increase or decrease their income [2]. It is useful to compare risk preferences to decisions in the
experiment in order to control for risk preferences when analyzing
decisions.
At the end of every period before the outcome was known, we
also asked subjects how confident they were that their decision was
the best one. This is commonly elicited in the finance literature [8]
and is important for quantifying the possible increase in confidence
from using FinVis. This also helps us to gauge how confidence
may change over time in either treatment. Finally, at the end of the
experiment subjects were also asked to rate the usefulness of the information screen and the likelihood that they would use this screen
to make decisions in practice. Subjects were also asked to report
on their confidence in their overall decisions and in their decisionmaking abilities in financial planning. Confidence and usefulness
were rated on an 8-point scale, while likelihood for future use and
decision-making abilities were rated on a 3-point scale.
7 R ESULTS
Experiment results confirmed our conjecture that FinVis improves
decision-making. Allocations in the FinVis treatment (FV) resulted
in statistically significantly greater expected returns for the same
level of risk as compared to allocations in the baseline treatment
(B). The FV group explored the dataset at almost double the rate
of the B group, and significant learning occurred in the FV group
but not in the B group. Post-experiment questionnaires showed that
subjects in the FV group were more confident making decisions.
Also, all subjects in the FV group reported that they were likely
to use FinVis in practical application, as compared to slightly over
half of the B group.
Subjects did not differ statistically significantly in their risk preferences, and this was confirmed using an unpaired independent
sample t-test for both the objective and subjective risk elicitation
tasks. This suggests that the two treatments are comparable in this
regard. Table 1 summarizes the means and standard deviations of
all subjects’ allocation decisions in all periods for funds A, B, C
and D in each treatment. We used the proportion of total money
invested averaged across all 3 decision years for this calculation.
7.1 Finding One: Improved Decision-Making
The optimal decision is one which maximizes the expected return
at any level of risk, and this “efficient frontier” was calculated using
the theoretical approach developed by Markowitz [26]. We solved
the following constrained minimization problem:
Minimize
Subject to the Constraints:

P′ ΩP
P′ ΩP = E
P′ 1 = 1
P≥0

(7)

where Ω is the n × n variance-covariance matrix, P is a n × 1
vector of investment expected returns, E is the vector of expected
return of the portfolio and 1 is a vector of 1’s. The efficient frontier
is created by varying E so that each data point on the frontier corresponds to a vector of investment proportions. Figure 5 shows this

theoretical benchmark overlaid with a scatter plot of all expected
returns and risk properties of actual portfolio choices of subjects in
each treatment for periods 3 through 63 . We derived the return and
risk properties of the portfolio allocation choices for each period by
calculating the expected return and standard deviation of the chosen
portfolio in each year and then taking the average across three years.
Subjects in FV outperformed subjects in B in making decisions that
were closer to the efficient frontier. We analyzed the expected return and risk of portfolio choices in FV versus B using an unpaired
independent sample t-test, and the results are summarized in Table 2. For each t-test, we report p-values for (Ha : expected return
of FV > expected return of B) and (H0 : risk of FV = risk of B).
Accounting for learning in the first few periods, subjects in the FV
treatment chose portfolio allocations with statistically significantly
greater returns as compared to subjects in the B treatment. Risk
of chosen allocations was not statistically significantly different between treatments.

Figure 5: Theoretical vs. Actual Return & Risk

We found that subjects were less likely to resort to using the
1/n heuristic when using FinVis. Subjects did not use this heuristic often in either treatment, perhaps because the baseline tool also
mitigated the need for this heuristic. We calculated the number of
decisions in which subjects appeared to be using this heuristic by
counting the number of times that allocation choices for all of A,
B, C and D were ‘close’ to 41 using the open interval from 20% to
30% of the total invested. Across all periods and treatments, this
occurred only 2 times in B and 1 time in FV. We extended our measure to include the open interval from 14% to 36% and found that
such decisions occurred 10 times in B and only 4 times in FV.
7.2 Finding Two: Greater Exploration and Learning
through Visual Analytics
We were also able to test the exploratory nature of FinVis by comparing the amount of time and exploration spent in each treatment.

are still learning in periods 1-3, so these are not plotted.

We recorded the number of times an investment was added, removed, or modified during each period. Modification of an investment included actions such as changing the type, principal, or start
year of the investment. Investments were modified an average of
107 times per period in FV and 55 times per period in B. Investments were removed an average of 6 times per period in FV and 4
times per period in B, and added 13 times per period in FV and 11
times per period in B.
We used an independent sample t-test for each period and found
that subjects in FV modified investments more than subjects in B,
and this was statistically significant in almost all periods. Further,
the FV group removed and added investments at a greater rate, and
this was statistically significant in half of the periods. Table 3 summarizes the resulting p-values. It is unclear why results in period
6 reflects reduced exploration in FV, but it is possible that subjects
have explored sufficiently by this point. While the FV group explored the decision space more, both groups ended with a similar
number of investments at the end of each period (a mean of 7 and
standard deviation of 3). In half of the periods, subjects in FV spent
statistically significantly more time for each portfolio allocation decision, while in the remaining half of the periods subjects in FV did
not spend a statistically significantly different amount of time for
each decision. On average, subjects in FV spent 7 minutes on each
period, and subjects in B spent 5 minutes. These results suggest
that the FinVis tool improves the amount of exploration, which can
help reduce the “ambiguity aversion” bias. Increased exploration
may be a contributing factor to greater learning over time in FV
and compared to B.
7.3 Finding Three: Increased Confidence and Perception of Usefulness
Confidence was elicited at the end of each period using an 8-point
scale from ‘least confident’ (0) to ‘most confident’ (7). Average
confidence levels were 3.6 for the B group and 4.1 for the FV group.
Subjects were also asked to report their overall confidence at the
very end of the experiment: the average confidence level of the FV
group was 4 while the average confidence level of the B group was
3.5. The median confidence was 4 for both groups. The confidence
elicitation is not ideal because this is a between-subjects design;
therefore, we cannot compare the same subject’s confidence across
treatments. For this reason, we also asked subjects if after completing the experiment they were more, less, or equally confident
in their abilities to understand financial planning. 85% of subjects
in B reported that they were equally confident, while 15% reported
that they were less confident. In contrast, 23% of subjects in FV
were more confident, 62% were equally confident, and 15% were
less confident. We conclude that some improvement in confidence
does occur with the use of FinVis. The greater confidence of the
FV group is an important result, because individuals who are not
confident would be less likely to be able to develop a financial plan
in practical application [24].
We also asked subjects how likely they are to use a system such
as the one presented to them to plan investment decisions in practice. 38% of B subjects reported that they were “not very likely”
to use the baseline program, 46% of B subjects were “somewhat
likely”, and only 15% of B subjects were “very likely” to use it.

In contrast, 61% of FV subjects were “somewhat likely” and 39%
of FV subjects were “very likely” to use the FinVis program. This
result suggests that FinVis would be more widely adopted by the
general public.

C ONCLUSIONS

AND

F UTURE W ORK

We developed a visual analytics tool that allows the non-expert user
to make improved personal finance decisions. A laboratory experiment was conducted and we found that subjects in the treatment
using the FinVis program outperformed subjects using a modified
version with the same information in tabular form, and this result
was statistically significant. FinVis helped subjects learn to overcome decision biases that are common in economics, and improved
subjects’ confidence. This is a meaningful result, suggesting that
visual analytics lowers the cognitive cost and allows subjects to analyze decisions without resorting to suboptimal “rules of thumb”.
8.1 Future Work
The current version of FinVis is necessarily simple in order to establish a baseline for future extensions. Our ultimate objective is to extend FinVis for use in practical applications, which can be achieved
through a few additions to the system. These include adapting the
system to allow easy addition of investments of any duration or
characteristics. The existing financial model does not account for
many possible factors like periodic trends, inflation and transaction
costs, which could be incorporated to improve the predictive power
of FinVis. Alternative visual analytics tools can also be developed,
and experimental methods can be used to compare their value to
that of FinVis.
