A BSTRACT
Understanding the space and time characteristics of human interaction in complex social networks is a critical component of visual
tools for intelligence analysis, consumer behavior analysis, and human geography. Visual identification and comparison of patterns
of recurring events is an essential feature of such tools. In this paper, we describe a tool for exploring hotel visitation patterns in and
around Rebersburg, Pennsylvania from 1898-1900. The tool uses
a wrapping spreadsheet technique, called reruns, to display cyclic
patterns of geographic events in multiple overlapping natural and
artificial calendars. Implemented as an Improvise visualization, the
tool is in active development through a iterative process of data
collection, hypothesis, design, discovery, and evaluation in close
collaboration with historical geographers. Several discoveries have
inspired ongoing data collection and plans to expand exploration to
include historic weather records and railroad schedules. Distributed
online evaluations of usability and usefulness have resulted in numerous feature and design recommendations.

1 I NTRODUCTION
As a part of the research and development agenda for visual analytics [15], the development of integrated software for rapid construction of visual data analysis tools is a recent focus of research
in both information and geographic visualization [11]. The goal
is to allow users to explore information that contains geospatial,
temporal, and abstract components in a flexible, integrated, interactive graphical environment that requires minimal training to use.
In pursuit of this goal, Improvise [17] is an exploratory visualization software application that is written entirely in Java and is freely
available on the web under an open source license. In Improvise,
analysts rapidly build and browse multiple coordinated views of
their data. What makes Improvise special is that it provides precise
control over how interaction affects the presentation of space, time,
and abstract data attributes in and between multi-layer maps, scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots, tables, spreadsheets, and other
views. Most importantly, Improvise visualizations can be rapidly
modified and extended to develop hypotheses and exploit discoveries during ongoing geovisual exploration and analysis.

This paper describes the evolutionary process of developing a
visual tool for exploring visitation patterns in hotel guest registers.
Genealogists and autograph collectors have long valued information found in the registers of historic hotels. Academic researchers
can also extract a wealth of information about commercial and cultural connectivity patterns from these archival documents. Most
registers contain a date, name, and hometown for each visitor. They
may also include information such as whether the guest represented
a business, minstrel show, or baseball team, whether they were traveling with a spouse, or whether they stabled a horse in the livery.
Starting with a data set transcribed from the guest register for
the Rebersburg Hotel in Rebersburg, PA from 1898-1900, the visualization evolved through an iterative process of creating views,
populating them with data, and coordinating them in terms of user
interaction. This tightly integrated method of building and browsing visualizations in Improvise makes it possible to realize and experiment with different displays of the hotel data set in a matter
of hours, including a multi-layer map of guest hometowns along
railroads and rivers, table views containing nested bar plots of visits over time for individual guests and their residences, and an arc
diagram showing sequences of visits by guests individually and in
groups.
The key component of the visualization is a glyph-based technique called reruns that displays temporal information in the cells
of a wrapping spreadsheet, thereby allowing exploration of cyclic
temporal patterns across multiple natural and artificial calendars.
Using glyphs rather than pixels (as in visualization of infant sleep
cycles [18]) increases the number of timescales that can be encoded
in a single view. Interactive scrubbing over time (by panning and
zooming rows and columns of cells) offsets the corresponding decrease in the number of data items that can appear inside the view
at any given time. Interactive adjustment of period length enables
visual identification of periodic behavior of varying duration, much
the same as in spiral-based visualizations of periodic data [2].
Extensive cross-filtering between the reruns view, map, and other
views allows analysts to follow chains of evidence involving complex groupings of people, dates, and places. Moreover, the data
domain, rapid design approach, and analysis process appear to be
directly applicable to current efforts to develop visual tools for use
in intelligence analysis and emergency response management.
Using the visualization, historical geographers have discovered
numerous interesting patterns that prompt a large increase in data
collection and a desire to expand exploration to include weather and
transportation information. Evaluation of the tool suggests strong
support for continued efforts along these avenues as well.
2 DATA C OLLECTION AND T RANSCRIPTION
The register for the Rebersburg Hotel [3] lists daily guests at a small
hotel in Rebersburg, a village in the Brush Valley region of Centre County, Pennsylvania, between June 1898 and November 1900.
All told there are 2411 guest entries. Some 219 different places of
origin are recorded, including 162 towns and cities in Pennsylvania, 14 in New York, and seven in Ohio, as well as 36 places in 13
other states, plus Canada and a visitor from London, England. With
nearly a hundred guests each month signing the register from this

35

The spatial and temporal patterns found by these methods are
limited to aggregated representations of the data set. The texture of
individual dates and guests was lost. Moreover, these search methods are relatively time consuming. In order to understand the intricacies of social connectivity patterns at the level of individual people and relationships, new methods are needed to bridge historical
domain knowledge with visual analysis techniques. (For examples
of historical geographers working in this area see [8, 9].)

wide variety of places, thousands of data points represent patterns
of local and regional connectivity. However, when analyzing the
actual archival document (figure 1), patterns were not immediately
apparent. Barely legible signatures and cryptic notations were bewildering and the eye rested on the bizarre, such as a sketch of a
log cabin added by a traveling vaudeville company or the batting
line-up of a visiting baseball team.
The data set was transcribed into a spreadsheet so that visits
could be sorted and temporal and spatial patterns discerned using
computational methods. The process of transcribing each entry
into appropriate columns in the spreadsheet took approximately 80
hours. Once the data set was transcribed, the columns for guests
and residences were sorted to check for errors and/or inconsistencies within the data set. Place-name indexes were consulted to clarify settlement names. Some place names could not be deciphered
or located, nor could some surnames (overall, 6% of the data set
was not legible). Summary tables were made for total number of
visits per person and per declared home residence. Then, graphs
of these tables were created to provide a visual representation of
which visitors and residences appeared most often. Many guests
appeared several times throughout the two-and-a-half-year period.
Forty people registered at the hotel on at least four occasions; one
came 78 times. Further research using other archival resources revealed that some of these repeat visitors were draymen (heavy cart
drivers), hucksters (local peddlers), and traveling salesmen. Three
of the hucksters, A. M. Sheats, R. A. Sheats, and Harry Welshans,
came to the hotel a combined 148 times from Booneville in neighboring Sugar Valley. For each of these men, the observed pattern
of visits involves a single day of the week: Tuesdays for Welshans,
Fridays for both Sheats. E. K. Hess, a traveling salesman from
Williamsport, paid 40 visits to the hotel. Like the Booneville hucksters, his visits were also predominantly on a single day, in his case
Thursdays, with very few visits on any other day of the week. A
graph of monthly visit totals by all guests revealed evidence of seasonal rhythms; some summer months had nearly twice the number
of visitors as winter months.
The geographical location of each home residence was obtained
by merging the hotel data set with an existing spatial data set. The
home location and number of visits were then mapped using commercial GIS software, revealing distance-decay gradients. More
than 1800 visits were by people whose claimed residence was less
than 50 miles from Rebersburg, and more than half were visiting
from within 20 miles of the hotel. Many of these places were accessible only by horse and wagon, as the nearest railroad stations
were nine miles south in Coburn and 20 miles north in Mill Hall.

3 E XPLORATORY V ISUALIZATION IN I MPROVISE
Improvise is a self-contained, web-capable visualization builder
and browser that shares many capabilities with other coordinated
multiple view visualization systems [10, 13, 12] and toolkits [5, 7].
Users browse visualizations using mouse and keyboard interactions
to navigate multidimensional space and select data items across
multiple coordinated views.
Improvise visualizations are built around a coordination model
called Live Properties that is coupled with a visual abstraction and
data processing language called Coordinated Queries. Coordination takes place through shared interactive parameters that determine what, how and where views display data. Multiple views are
coordinated whenever they are connected through at least one such
parameter. Coordinated Queries is a flexible, yet high-level visualization query language for coordinating access, processing, and rendering of multiple data sets across multiple views. Query expressions specify how to map data attributes into graphical attributes in
views. Multiple data sets can be loaded, indexed, grouped, filtered,
sorted, and visually encoded in terms of navigation and selection
in and between multiple views. The combination of Live Properties and Coordinated Queries enables open-ended visual analysis
by allowing users to design, construct, explore, and extend highlycoordinated visualizations of multiple simultaneous data sets interactively.
Improvise consists of a graphic user interface on top of a modular library of visualization components (figure 2). In the user interface, designers create, layout, parameterize, and coordinate views.
Building occurs inside the same top-level window that contains
views. Building is fully live, so that all design changes take effect
immediately without the need for a separate compilation stage. This
live, amodal interface design allows trained users to switch rapidly
between building and browsing. The goal is to facilitate open-ended
visual exploration and analysis of information by close-knit teams
of collaborating domain experts and experienced visualization designers. In other words, to support improvisational visualization on
a timescale of hours or days.

Figure 2: The Improvise software architecture.

Improvise has been used to build a wide variety of information
visualizations, and has recently been extended for geovisualization
of census, election, and ham radio communications involving spatial, temporal, and abstract data attributes. The ongoing evolution of
the hotel register visualization is one of the major successes of this

effort. (Because it is just one of many Improvise “documents”—all
saved as regular, self-contained XML files—we have not adopted a
formal name for the visualization as an independent tool. In fact,
we refer to it internally simply as “the hotels vis.”)
4 H OTELS V ISUALIZATION I NTERFACE
Using Improvise, we have developed a visualization of the guest
register for a hotel in Rebersburg, PA from 1898-1900. The visualization is a result of an iterative process of design, construction, testing, exploration, and evaluation involving close collaboration between visualization researchers [Weaver, Robinson, Peuquet,
MacEachren] and historical geographers [Fyfe, Holdsworth]. This
process has resulted in four major versions and dozens of minor versions of the visualization over the course of six months. Evolution
of the visualization has been driven primarily by the exploratory
and analytic needs of the historical geographers, who have adopted
the visualization as a important tool in their research arsenal.
The visualization (figure 3) consists of the following views:
• A table view, showing the names, total visits, and pattern of
visits over time for each guest.
• A table view, showing the same information for each residence (place of origin).
• A reruns view, showing total visits on each day using text
and/or color. Squares distinguish weekends from circular
weekdays. Months and seasons optionally appear as cell
edges and a fill gradient, respectively. Cycle length and cell

size can be rapidly adjusted using sliders. Mousing over a cell
shows its date in the top left corner.
• A vertical histogram along the right side of the reruns view,
summarizing total visits for each period.
• A horizontal histogram along the bottom of the reruns view,
summarizing total visits for each day in the cycle.
• A multi-layer map, showing crow-flies paths from residences
to the hotel, relative to railroads and rivers.
• An arc diagram [16], showing past (red) and future (blue) visits by guests visiting on selected dates.
• A drill-down table view, showing individual register entries.
All views support additive selection of multiple data items. In
the reruns view, selection of individual dates or particular cycles
and periods happens by clicking individual cells or rubberbanding around blocks of cells. The map allows selection of residences
by clicking, rubberbanding, or lassoing regions. Improvements to
querying and rendering performance have resulted in navigation
and selection coordination that is much faster than in earlier versions, enabling smooth interaction throughout the visualization.
Extensive cross-filtering between views enables exploration of
complex interdependent groupings of people, dates, and places.
Bidirectional filtering allows users to show subsets of guests and/or
home residences (as selected in the corresponding table views) in
the reruns view, and conversely to show subsets of dates (as selected

Organized Groups

When examining the visitation patterns of the hucksters from
Booneville, relative consistency in weekday visits for each huckster is immediately identifiable (figure 4). Filtering the reruns view
on the three selected guests reveals alternating visits on Tuesday
and Friday. Rapidly switching which of the three is selected reveals that Welshans stays on Tuesday and that Friday visits by R.
A. Sheats transition to Friday visits by A. M. Sheats in March 1898.
The latter is also suggested by per-guest charts of visits over time
in the guests table view.
Prior to the use of the visualization, each register entry for these
visitors had to be manually added to a calendar. In this cumbersome
process, the individuals’ visitation patterns could not be compared
in the context of all the other guests. In addition, the original calendar did not have the ability to change the cycle length for exploration of different cyclic temporal patterns.

Visual exploration has been a key factor in the discovery of several
spatiotemporal patterns of social relationships at a time when travel
was by horse and buggy locally, or along specific railroad corridors
over longer distances. In particular, the visualization has provided
significant evidence in support of hypotheses regarding cooperation
between travelling merchants, the effects of weather and seasonal
climate variations, circuitous routes taken by salesmen, and gatherings on holidays, as well as a variety of idiosyncratic travel patterns
involving individuals, families, and other groups.

in the reruns view) in the guests and residences table views. Filtering between the residences table view and the nested bar plots in the
guests table view allows users to show temporal visitation patterns
for all guests, restricted to travel that involves selected residences.
Similar filtering in the opposite direction shows temporal patterns
of travel from all towns by selected guests only.
Using a process of successive selection and filtering, it is possible to ask specific questions and follow detailed chains of evidence.
For example, an analyst might explore possible repeat meetings between guests prior to some critical event by asking the question,
“For visitors on a particular date, on what previous dates did two
or more of them visit repeatedly?” To start to answer this question,
the analyst would select the critical event date in the reruns view,
filter the guests table on date, select all guests in the guests table,
filter the reruns view on selected guests, select all dates in the reruns view that involve multiple visitors, then look for guests having
multiple visits with similar temporal patterns in the guests view. Filtering the residences table and map view on dates and guests during
this process would provide increasingly specific information about
travel from particular cities, possibly revealing overlapping origins,
destinations, or paths for guests under scrutiny.
Moreover, this process can involve unknown or uncertain people,
places, and times by selecting similar names, nearby residences (as
indicated in the map), and preceding or following dates. The ability to visualize uncertainty is critical for dealing with noise in the
original data and errors in the transcription process. In the visualization, uncertain guest (44%) and place (14%) names are indicated with question marks. Uncertain portions of such names are
similarly indicated (e.g. “?, PA”). Because all views can display
all register entries—including uncertain ones—it is possible to explore patterns involving unidentified persons across time and space.
The exception is the map view, which does depict uncertain guests
from certain places but does not depict any guests (certain or otherwise) from uncertain places. Many instances of possible errors
in the transcription process were discovered using the visualization
itself. In particular, the ability to select and filter on multiple guests
and residences gave us a means to explore whether similar names
in fact refer to the same person or place.

Weather and Climatic Effects

Finding the regular pattern of Friday visits by A. M. Sheats
prompted us to look for deviations from this routine. By setting
the reruns view to a 14-day cycle then scrolling to earlier dates,
we were able to determine that there were two periods when his
scheduled visits were not on Fridays. It was only after the seasons
option was turned on that we noticed that the only times he did not
arrive on a Friday was during winter months (figure 5). This has
led us to believe that the weather may have had something to do
with these variations. While the exact reason for these deviations
has not yet been determined, the tool has now guided us to examine
historical climate data to test this hypothesis. Such records indicate
that February 5-14, 1899 included “the arrival of the greatest Arctic
outbreak in United States meteorological records.” [6]
The visualization also reveals how time of year strongly correlates with the overall number of visits, possibly due to seasonal

Hotels

While exploring the travel patterns of frequent visitors, selecting
traveling salesman E. K. Hess of Williamsport led to the discovery
of visitation patterns spanning multiple weeks (figure 7). Changing
the cycle length of the reruns view to 14 days reveals that Hess visits strongly correlate with the second Thursday in this cycle, suggesting that he visited every other week. Perhaps more interesting is that there are several cases in which he did not return until
the fourth or even sixth week, always maintaining an even number of weeks between visits. This pattern suggests that salesmen
from larger cities such as Williamsport may have had larger circuits than those of the local hucksters, thus preventing them from
coming every week. The visualization also shows that two other
guests, William B. Chamberlain of Milton and Harry McClosky of
Williamsport, also adhered to similar schedules, always visiting an
even number of weeks after their previous visit and on the same day
of the week. This pattern prompts further research inquiries to determine the profession of these men and possibly identify additional
commercial connectivities, especially as all three men always came
in the second week of successive two week periods.

Gatherings

Using the reruns view, it is possible to efficiently determine on
which days the hotel had an unusually high number of guests, then
query those days to see if there are large groups of people traveling
together. For example, it can be seen that on Sunday September 2,
1900, there were 42 guests listed in the register (figure 8). Drilldown reveals that the double visit involves two entries under the
same name (W. L. Smith) but from different hometowns (Carroll
and “Fiedbar”, an illegible place name). Selecting all dates for visits by the 42 guests reveals that 32 of them were one-time visitors.
Additional exploration reveals that two repeat visitors, C. M.
Frank and C. H. Beck, both from Carroll, met twice at the beginning of the summer, perhaps to plan the fall event. Identifying this
pattern of repeat visits involved filtering guests on date (Labor Day
weekend Sunday), selecting all guests, filtering dates on selected
guests, selecting the other two dates with more than one visitor, then
noting that Frank and Beck had three visits total each (figure 9).

Reruns

Figure 8: Visits on Sunday, September 2, 1900 (Labor Day weekend). Non-highlighted dates show other visits by the same guests.

These results prompt further research inquiries as to whether
there was Labor Day activity, perhaps with a dinner at the hotel,
and a cascading set of questions: What other holidays attracted
visitors? Were there other times when different people with the
same surname congregated, perhaps for a family reunion? Do busy
days involve weddings, baptisms, or funerals? Genealogical dataconstruction activity could be supported in the visualization by incorporating data sets for county birth, marriage and death registers,
and local church or cemetery records. Showing multiple calendar
data sets in parallel might involve visual encoding of even more
data dimensions in the existing reruns view, or addition of multiple
reruns views that coordinate with each other using synchronized
scrolling and brushing.

5.5 Interesting General Relationships
In addition to enabling specific discoveries, the visualization reveals
general relationships in the data set that uphold prior observations
and hypotheses. For example, we knew from transcribing that the
number of guests on weekend days was much lower than during the
week, a result reaffirmed in the horizontal histogram when showing
all visits over cycle lengths that are multiples of seven.
In another case, several different guests were registered at the
hotel who shared the same surname, Nearhood, as the proprietor of
the hotel. When querying all guests with this last name (figure 10),
it appears that, unlike most guests of the hotel, Nearhoods frequent
the hotel mainly on weekends. All but three are from Centre Hall,
a town ten miles to the west, serving as another reminder that roads
were unimproved and thus places were too far away to allow for a
daytime visit without an overnight stay.
5.6 Future Queries
Research in historical geography is much like intelligence analysis
in the sense that it involves careful detective work to coax answers
to highly specific questions from sparse and often extremely noisy
data. For instance, women appear very infrequently throughout the
register. When they do appear, most often they are listed as coming
with men under the terms “and wife” or “Mr. and Mrs.” In some
cases, “and lady” appears next to a guest’s name—though we never
found “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”! Only eleven women registered by
themselves under the titles “Mrs.” or “Miss”. This prompts further
research inquiries concerning where these women came from, what
means and patterns of travel were involved, and whether associated
males registered by themselves on other occasions.
Some guests note when they sign the register that they are traveling with one or two horses (housed in the livery stable behind the
hotel). This prompts further inquiries as to who these people were
and where they came from. For guests not listing a horse, how did
they arrive at the hotel? One means of transportation may have been
the stagecoach—the block for which still sits in front of the building
today—but this does not account for the lack of a horse annotation
by our local hucksters (who by definition would have the goods
they were selling with them, and hence likely a wagon). Does two
horses signify a freight wagon, whereas one horse implies a buggy?
A search of census records for all names of people traveling with a
horse might reveal a specific occupational sector. The literature on

Hotels

Figure 10: Travel from Centre Hall by possible members of the hotel
proprietor’s family. Nine of 15 visits by Harry O. Nearhood (highlighted) occurred sporadically over a three week period in April 1900.

hucksters suggests they often had a weekly circuit, only returning to
their “home” place on weekends to refill their wagon at their store.
In such cases, the obvious question is: What hotels were frequented
the night prior and the night following their stay at the Rebersburg
Hotel? In other registers being analyzed, notations sometimes give
instructions for forwarding mail, and invariably it is to a named hotel in another town. Toward answering these questions, we have
recently added a second hotel register data set to the visualization
and are currently transcribing several more.
6 E VALUATION
We conducted a series of formative evaluations of the visualization.
These evaluations targeted two goals: to solicit ideas for improvements and enhancements, and to evaluate it in terms of how well it
satisfies a set of precepts for the design of visualization tools.
Twelve Penn State graduate students participated in the evaluation. All were enrolled in a graduate seminar on geovisual analytics. All but two were enrolled for graduate studies in Geography
that focus on emerging issues in GIScience. The other two students
came from related fields in the school of Information Science &
Technology. Members of the user group possess varied knowledge
of GIS systems and are familiar with research priorities for the advancement of visual analytics.
6.1 Distributed Usability Assessment
Software evaluation activities often require significant investment
of human and financial capital to develop and organize activities
and procure technology to capture data. To facilitate assessment of
the hotels visualization, we adapted e-Delphi, a web-based toolkit
designed to support Delphi exercises. The Delphi method [4] was
devised by the RAND Corporation shortly after World War II as a
way for structuring group decisions in a manner that ensures personality conflicts and power relationships do not taint the presentation of ideas. The e-Delphi toolkit has been used in the past in
consensus building exercises with climate change scientists [14].
Evaluation sessions take place in an online collaboratory in which
moderators can quickly initiate and lead multiple rounds of discussion and other activities. Round-based activities include surveys,
metrics, free responses, voting, threaded discussions, or a mixture
of these methods.

We adapted the e-Delphi toolkit as a means to support group input to software evaluations. We did not apply the Delphi Method
per se; we were not focused specifically on building a consensus
among our users, developing a forecast, or setting policy, which
are the typical uses of the Delphi method. The toolkit allows us to
conduct qualitative evaluations via the web with little investment in
time and effort by either researchers or participants. The flexible design of the toolkit allows us to support a distributed, asynchronous,
user centered design process.
6.2 Process
We conducted three rounds of evaluation using e-Delphi. In Round
1, we asked users to imagine extensions to the visualization tool. In
Round 2, we had users indicate their opinions on the fit of the tool
to a set of design precepts. Round 3 had users discuss the responses
they provided in Round 2.
6.2.1 Round 1
We asked users to complete two short tasks to become familiar with
the capabilities of the visualization. We then asked them to respond
to four short answer questions in e-Delphi:
1. Briefly describe a scenario in which a historian might use a
visualization tool like the one you have tested.
2. What other types of data would be interesting to examine with
the tools you used today? Why?
3. Assume your task is to design one additional visualization tool
to work with the set you have used today. Describe what you
would add next and why.
4. Imagine you work at a newspaper and you have been given
this software to develop story ideas for future articles. What
tools and interactions would you need to do your job?
These questions were designed to provoke suggestions for situations in which the visualization might be useful, additional kinds of
data that might be required to tell a story using the visualization, and
extensions that could be incorporated into the visualization to enhance exploration and analysis. We asked users to avoid critiquing
basic appearance and behavior aspects of the visualization interface
in favor of focusing attention on higher-level ideas and goals for future prototypes. Users had 90 minutes (as part of seminar class
time) to complete the sample tasks and answer these prompts. We
allowed users to return to their responses for three days afterward
in case they wished to revise their answers.
6.2.2 Round 2
Amar and Stasko [1] identify six precepts that can be used to evaluate the design of information visualizations in terms of how well
they bridge Worldview and Rationale gaps:
• Provide facilities for creating, acquiring, and transferring
knowledge or metadata about important domain parameters
within a data set. [Worldview]
• Support discovery (automated or manual) of useful correlative
models and constraints. [Worldview]
• Support the interactive formulation and verification of user
hypotheses. [Worldview]
• Expose uncertainty in data measures and aggregations and
show possible effects of uncertainty on outcomes. [Rationale]
• Clearly present what comprises the representation of a relationship and present concrete outcomes when appropriate.
[Rationale]

• Clarify possible sources of causation. [Rationale]
In Round 2 we assessed the visualization in terms of these precepts. We asked users to indicate their level of agreement that the
visualization satisfied these precepts on a five-point Likert scale.
We also requested a short text response to provide justification for
their choices. The instructions suggested that they re-examine the
toolkit as necessary to refresh their memory. The activity took 90
minutes and we again provided several days for revision.
6.2.3

Round 3

In Round 3, we asked users to examine a major theme that we noticed in the results from Round 2: the Worldview precepts were
more satisfied by the visualization than the Rationale precepts. The
instructions were to discuss this dichotomy in terms of which things
should be implemented next to introduce a more appropriate balance to the design. Users had another 90 minute session during
class time and a few days afterward for revision. We extended response time an additional week to compensate for spring break.
6.3
6.3.1

Results
Round 1

Round 1 provided a great deal of valuable feedback on potential extensions to the visualization, additional data sources, and situations
in which it might be particularly useful. One proposed extension
was the addition of a geographically-based filtering capability, to
allow the use of the map as the primary interface for selecting guest
visits with a bounding box over cities of interest. Another user
suggested the need for a means to help find groups of people who
travelled together on the same day, perhaps from different places
and for different lengths of stay. Several users mentioned a desire
to drill down to greater detail for each guest, to view a profile for
each person. This profile would contain personal information such
as their workplace, address, birthday, and other details. Other suggestions for additional data sources include: transportation schedules, letters and other personal communication, bank transactions,
hospital records, and the ability to integrate the results of Google
searches for dates and names.
Users also requested sophisticated capture and annotation tools
as part of the visualization so that they could develop stories about
what they were seeing. Suggestions for situations in which such
tools might be useful included: tracking the impact of a major event
(such as a flood or hurricane), analyzing the travel behavior of a
specific individual or group of people, and characterizing hotels in
terms of the types of people they typically attract.
6.3.2

Round 2

The agreement between responses we received in Round 2 indicated that our users generally agreed that the visualization works
to bridge the three Worldview gaps to create knowledge, support
discovery of correlative models, and support the interactive formulation of hypotheses. On the other hand, users generally disagreed
that it satisfies the three Rationale gap precepts to expose uncertainty, present concrete outcomes, and clarify causation.
The biggest weakness noted by users was the inability to expose uncertainty in data and indicate its effect on outcomes. This
was the only precept of the six that received all negative or neutral
responses. Users pointed out that there was no explicit visual indication of uncertainty in the data set. A few noted that the only way
for uncertainty to enter the picture in the current design was if the
user could infer it from prior intimate knowledge of the data set.
6.3.3

Round 3

Round 3 provided further clarification of the survey responses received in Round 2. To better expose uncertainty and show its effects

41

on data, users suggested the creation of a visual summary for register entries that are incomplete or otherwise uncertain. Because
the register data set is coded with question marks where names or
places are uncertain, it will be relatively easy to implement a summary table that either contains all such records or tags each record
with a more obvious indication of uncertainty.
In order to better satisfy the need to present what comprises a
relationship and to suggest concrete outcomes, users suggested we
work first on clarifying the tasks that might be accomplished using
the visualization. This request stemmed from the fact that some
users were unclear about the relationships they should be looking
for, so they could not confidently define better ways to suggest outcomes.
To clarify causation, the visualization could provide details on
demand for individual dates, guests, and residences. Users expected to see ancillary information like holidays, special events,
and weather in the reruns view. In the map, the number of guests
and their names could appear as a popup when mousing over residences and paths of travel. The guests view could provide an option
to further visually highlight individuals or groups using avatars to
better break down patterns viewed in the reruns and map views.

C ONCLUSIONS

Exploratory visualization provides a faster and more productive
means of analysis than previous methods of examining historic hotel visits. By coordinating the reruns view with map and tabular
displays, the hotels visualization allows detailed and contextualized queries regarding cyclic temporal patterns (in days, weeks,
months, and years), seasonal temporal patterns with corresponding climate indications, social grouping patterns, spatial patterns
of travel from particular places or regions, and complex combinations of all of these. Although the visualization focuses on historical travel patterns in a specific social context, application to current problems of interest in the intelligence analysis and emergency
response communities—the behavior, movement, and communication of persons, groups, vehicles, and resources under the influence
of terrain, climate, and weather—is an obvious next step. In fact,
we anticipate that guest databases for multiple modern hotels (or
other nexus points in travel networks) could be incorporated into
the visualization in a short time. Future plans involve increasing the
usefulness of the visualization by adding historical weather records
and railroad schedules in order to analyze actual means and paths
of travel by hotel visitors.
The e-Delphi evaluations resulted in overall positive feedback as
well as concrete suggestions for design improvements and extensions to the visualization. As we implement these changes we will
continue to solicit feedback from both domain experts and general
users. The e-Delphi toolkit allows us to quickly conduct evaluations
that can be repurposed for multiple user groups with little effort on
our part. As the visualization matures, we will transition our evaluation efforts to techniques such as verbal protocol analysis and
formal focus groups composed of professional analysts.
By creating innovative ways of examining spatiotemporal data,
the visualization aids significantly in exploration of historical hotel
register data, providing an opportunity to see travel patterns that had
previously gone unrecognized. Data for other hotels in other places,
once transcribed, can be quickly incorporated, and spatiotemporal
patterns and irregularities can be quickly discerned. As a result, hypothesis generation and testing has accelerated over the traditional
techniques utilized in historical geography. Visual analysis has led
to multiple discoveries that have triggered new thought processes
and shaped new research questions about social connectivity relationships in rural areas at the turn of the twentieth century.
