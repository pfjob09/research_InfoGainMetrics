A BSTRACT
In the mobile call mini challenge of VAST 2008 contest, we explored the temporal communication patterns of Catalano/Vidro social network which is reflected in the mobile call data. We focus
on detecting the hierarchy of the social network and try to get the
important actors in it. We present our tools and methods in this
summary. By using the visual analytic approaches, we can find out
not only the temporal communication patterns in the social network
but also the hierarchy of it.

I NTRODUCTION

Our team solved the mobile call mini challenge in VAST 2008 contest. In order to find out temporal relationships among people and
hierarchy in the mobile call network, we developed a tool called
TemporalNet to explore the temporal mobile call graphs based on
our network visualization framework JSNVA.
1.1 Tools
JSNVA (Java Straight-line drawing Network Visual Analysis
framework) is a software framework for network visual analysis
in different applications. It has a clear architecture and supports a
more systematic way of implementing different straight-line graph
drawing algorithms which show different networks on different
views. JSNVA can be used as a front-end for visualization and
a back-end for analysis in applications, and it can be customized
for different applications. Based on JSNVA, we developed a tool
called TemporalNet to show the communication patterns in the call
graphs. In the mini challenge, we mainly used the force directed
layout algorithm to show the social networks.

2.2 Temporal Relationship
In order to detect the communication patterns, we construct call
graphs based on the call records. A call graph G is a pair (V, E),
where V is a finite set of vertices (mobile users), and E is a finite
set of vertex-pairs from V (mobile calls). So if user u calls user v,
then an edge (u, v) is said to exist in E. The edge (u, v) can be
either directed or undirected. According to the mobile phone call
records from June 1st 2006 to June 10th 2006, we find that the social
network structure changed greatly on June 8th 2006. In the first 7
days, the leader of the social network was 200.
In Fig. 1 the red edges are the calls formed on June 7th and the
blue ones are the calls formed on June 8th . We use the PageRank
value of each individual in the directed call graph formed in these
10 days to show the importance of the individual [1]. The sizes of
vertices indicate the importance of vertices. We find an interesting pattern that all the neighbors of 200 vanished in the call graph
formed on June 8th 2006 and there were some actors with large degrees replaced their positions. By visualizing the calling behaviors
of the actors in Fig. 1, we find out that the structure of the social
network changed greatly on the 8th day. The people who communicated with 1, 2, 3 and 5 changed to communicated with 309, 397,
360 and 306. In order to make this pattern more clearly, we set color
of 1, 2, 3, 5 as red and set color of 309, 397, 360, 306 as blue. We
will show the method of detecting equivalent actors in more details
in the following.

A NALYSIS A PPROACH

2.1 Data Set
The mobile call records cover a ten-day period in June 2006, and
are narrowed to about 400 unique mobile phones during this period.
The data set includes records with the following fields: identifier for
caller, identifier for receiver, time, duration and call origination cell
tower. The data set also tells us that Ferdinando Catalano’s identifier may be 200; close relatives and associate that he would be
calling would include David Vidro, Juan Vidro, Jorge Vidro, and
Estaban Catalano; Ferdinando would call brother Estaban most frequently; David Vidro coordinates high level in Paraiso activities.

2.3 Equivalent Actors
The problem of detecting similar vertices in a network is not a new
one. Two actors are considered structurally equivalent if they share
many of the same network neighbors [2]. There are a lot of measures to show the similarity between data objects, such as simple
matching coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, cosine similarity, Pearson’s correlation coefficient etc. [2, 3]. In order to get the similarity
between two vertices in the call graph formed in these 10 days,
we choose the Jaccard coefficient to measure how many common

neighbors they share. Let N(i) be the neighborhood of vertex i in a
network and |x| be the size of set x. Then the Jaccard coefficient of
an actor pair (i, j), which is symbolized by J(i, j), is given by the
following equation:
J(i, j) = J( j, i) =

|N(i) ∩ N( j)|
|N(i) ∪ N( j)|

their importance. As David Vidro coordinates high-level in Paraiso
activities and communications, we find that the person whose ID is
0 communicated with all the important people who communicated
with 200. He also communicated with the persons in the second
group whose identifiers are 306 and 309. We also guess that the
persons whose identifiers are 1 and 2 may be Juan Vidro and Jorge
Vidro. The one whose ID is 0 should be David Vidro.
3.0.2 Hierarchy
Fig. 3 shows the social network by combing the common green
vertices in Fig. 2 (A) and (B) as the third level. In our opinion, the
hierarchy of the Paraiso movement social network has 3 levels: the
first level is composed by the persons whose IDs are 0, 200 and 300;
the persons who are in red and dark blue are in the second level;
other persons in Fig. 3 are in the third level. The two groups with
dark blue and red are these people who have equivalent positions in
the social network.

Table 1 shows the Jaccard coefficients of these actor pairs with
high degrees in the call graph during the 10 days. The equivalent
actor pairs are (1, 309), (5, 306), (3, 360) and (2, 397).
3 R ESULTS
We can get that there are two groups of people who communicate
with a lot of people in the Catalano/Vidro social network. The first
group is the neighbors of 200 and their identifiers are 1, 2, 3 and 5.
The second group is the people who have the equivalent positions
with the people in the first group whose identifiers are 309, 397, 360
and 306. All the people in the second group called the person whose
ID is 300. As shown in Fig. 2, we use the egocentric networks of
200 and 300 to show the social network structure. We get the social
network by detecting the two egocentric networks whose roots are
200 and 300 in 2 hops. Fig. 2 (A) shows the social network of the
first 7 days, and Fig. 2 (B) shows the social network of the last 3
days. The green nodes are the ones in both social networks.

4 C ONCLUSION
Based on the mobile call records of the mini challenge in VAST
2008, we analyze the social network structure of Catalano/Vidro society. By visualizing the calling behaviors of the actors in the social
network, we find on the 8th day the structure of the social network
changes greatly. There are equivalent actors replace the positions
of Ferdinando Catalano’s neighbors and these actors all called the
person whose ID is 300. At last, after exploring these communication patterns, we construct a reduced social network structure to
show the hierarchy of the social network.

3 days.

3.0.1 Actors’ Names
We believe that the person whose ID is 200 is Ferdinando Catalano and the person whose ID is 5 should be his brother Estaban
Catalano. As the person whose ID is 200 have communicated with
6 persons and the person whose ID is 5 have communicated with
him most frequently. They have communicated for 14 times and
15183 seconds during these 10 days. The person whose ID is 3 is
the second one who communicate with Ferdinando Catalano most
frequently, while they have communicated for 8 times and 8520
seconds. So we believe that the person whose ID is 5 should be
Estaban Catalano. The sizes of vertices in these figures indicate
