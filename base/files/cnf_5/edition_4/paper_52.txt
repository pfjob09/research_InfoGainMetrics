Abstract
Similarity searching is an excellent approach for
getting information from subjective materials like
images or videos. Some excellent works on special
domains have done. We focus on Statistical images.
These kinds of images have some excellent features
that can be clearly extractable and useable in
similarity searching. But there no significant work has
been done in this area. So we have done some
preliminary works in this domain. By some extensive
analysis we classify images of this domain in some sub
domains and also identified the nature of features
those can be considered as silent. We develop a
prototype based on this analysis where we store
extracted features information of a statistical images
as Meta data. Then we devise some strategy to do
similarity searching using standard query formulation.

Keywords: Similarity searching, Statistical images,
Information extraction, Meta data.
1. Introduction
Information matching can be grossly divided in two
kinds- Exact matching and Similarity matching.
Information matching in Images are basically
similarity matching. Image matching is done by global
features or local features[1] extracted from images.
There are some general features common to all kind of
images like-color histogram (global feature) or shape
of silent objects (local feature) but domain specific
knowledge give more meaning to these features.
Though there are some general developed systems
(QBIC, KMeD[1]) for similarity matching but it looks
more meaningful when domain specific knowledge is
incorporated with such systems. There are some fine
work done in medical sector[2] , satellite images[3]
and some other domains. Petrakis [2] system builds on
the pre concepts of common body organs like heart

and lungs as labeled objects (according to medical
physics) to find the “unexpected” or “unlabeled”
objects (e.g., “tumor,” “hematoma,” etc.) those are not
similar to natural organ.
We focus our similarity matching on Statistical figures.
If we observer carefully then we will find most of the
recent documents (specially scientific and business
docs) contain some kind of statistical images to make
the concepts more understandable. Actually this trend
boosted after introduction of GUI in OS. There are
some common features on statistical figures which
make its suitable for domain specific similarity
searching.
As there is no precedence of similarity searching in this
domain we have to support preliminary analysis
extensively. We organize our work in three phases • Analyze features of statistical figures or
images (SI)
• Representation of features as meta data
• Develop an approach for similarity matching
o Inter sub domain
o Intra sub domain
We also developed a prototype system where we
implement these concepts partially. In the following
sections we check previous techniques for image
features extraction for similar searching. Then we
specify our approach for this domain with a developed
prototype; finally we focus our future trend of research
in this field.

2. Related works
If we observe the statistical figure then we will find
that local features such as shape, color and position can
be a good candidate for similarity matching than global
features like color histogram. So we utilize local
features mostly with some special global feature to
develop our system.
The most important feature in statistical domain is
shape. We classify statistical images mostly in three

categories according to the objects shape in presented
images as –
• Bar chart
• Pie Chart
• Line Chart
There are some advance techniques for finding
shapes from figures [4] & [5]. We use typical method
to extract different objects form the figure; we take
color difference from background as an indication of
shape. Relative positioning of objects in an image is
also an important feature. We use row or column
scanning to get the relative positions of objects [6].

find the following features that can be used for
similarity searching• Number of line
• Number of silent points in a line
• Position of each silent points
• Color of lines
• Textual Annotation

3. Analyze features of SI
We mentioned that there are mainly three categories
of statistical figures we consider- Bar, Pie or line
charts. Each of them has some special features to
extract that can be used for similarity searching. A
special feature that is implicitly common of this
domain is that they possess geometrical shapes only.
Actually we use this feature to filter non statistical
figure.

If we observe a bar chart (Figure 1) carefully then we
will find some common feature that can be useful for
similarity search• Number of bars
• Width of each bar
• Height of each bar
• Horizontal or vertical alignment of
base
• Color sequence
• Textual annotation
3.2 Important features of Pie chart
Now for simple Pie chart (Figure 2) we observe the
following features• Number of slices
• Angle of each slices
• Area of each slices
• Color of each slices

matching is possible as -matching in sub-domain like
comparing Bar chart with Bar chart, Pie chart with
Pie chart etc and cross matching like Bar chart with
Pie chart. To support both of them we have done
some analysis to find the features of different domain
that can be resemble with each other. In the following
sections we describe both of them as Intra and Inter
domain matching.

4. Representation of features as Meta
Data
In previous sections we described possible features
information that can be extractable from a statistical
image. It’s a common trend to save this information
as meta data as searching similarity from meta data is
much faster and convenient. We save this
information in structured database with some
formatting. Some special features like color
sequence, height/width sequence need formatting to
support sub-string matching. Other features are
mostly numerical (number of bar/slices/lines etc) and
saved as number.

5.1 Intra domain Matching
It’s a simple matching based on the extracted feature
of an Image. We can make the match harder by
adding the features constraint when we search the
similarity. As shown in Figure 5, according to the
number of bars these three charts are similar. But if
we add more constraint like the color sequence and
height of the bar then they become non-similar. In
our prototype system we give user this option to
reduce the search result.

5.2 Inter domain Matching
Base on the same data different presentation is
possible. It’s a common strategy to represent
information for clear understanding, as shown in
Figure 6 both Images posses same data but different
chart. So matching of different kind of charts is also
possible. After analyzing we find some resembling
features of different charts. In Table-1 We show
them.

6. Prototype Development
According to our above analysis we built a partial
prototype system. It mainly consists of two parts –
Image recognition & retrieval module and Similarity
searching module. In Figure 7 and Figure 8 we gave
the architecture of the modules as diagrammatic

view. We use local feature to recognize statistical
objects in a picture. For different type of figures we
propose deferent type of agent with its own
information retrieval criteria based on the features
discussed in section-3. We implement similarity
searching as searching by example. An image is
presented as a sample to find the similar images in
our database. First the system collects features
information of the sample image as meta data, then
compare the data with our stored meta DB and shows
only those images that resemble with it.
In Figure 9 we show our developed system. We
support some extra features for similarity searching
that we did not include in our discussion as they are
not fully analyzed like area covered by silent objects.
Due to deformation or scaling of images it become
hard to match similar figures. So we also support
ratio analysis of some features to find similar images.

7. Conclusion

Acknowledgments

Similarity searching is a very popular theme in image
searching. Though domain specific implementation is
common now but we did not find any work in
Statistical Images. Due to extensive use of computer
aided document composer (like Excel) it becomes a
typical matter to have some statistical figures in
documents. There are other sources of statistical
figures; actually any works with some kind of
measurement produce them. So building specialized
searching module for this domain will enhance
information extraction capability.
We think our
work is pioneer work in this domain and it makes our
challenge harder to implement our ideas. We analyze
this domain and categorized generically though more
specified categorization is possible. From our
analysis we identified the main features of each
category. Finally we implement a prototype based on
our analysis. This prototype is not fully standardized
as we need more analysis on salient features of this
domain and need some sophisticated model to handle
extracted meta data.
