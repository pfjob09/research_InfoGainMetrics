Abstract
In telemedicine, the storage of image and forwarding of
image requires high storage space and high bandwidth
respectively. To save the storage space and to reduce the
bandwidth for communication; the image is to be
compressed. Recently the Multi-resolution technique by
wavelet transform has emerged as a cutting edge
technology within the field of image analysis and
compression. Relatively new class of wavelets called
Multiwavelet; are new addition to the body of wavelet
theory. Realizable as matrix –valued filter banks leading
to wavelet basis, were introduced and which are able to
posses all desirable properties like Orthogonality,
Symmetry, and Short support etc. simultaneously, which
are needed for better performance compression. In this
paper we have proposed a heterogeneous wavelet filter
approach for MRI image compression. The performance
of the proposed method is compared and analyzed in
detail and the promising results and findings are
presented.

1. Introduction
The Indian health care industry is one of the biggest
industries in the world. Where, the telemedicine is the
method, by which the patients can be examined,
investigated, monitored and treated, with the patient and
the doctor physically located in different places. A major
goal of telemedicine is to eliminate unnecessary traveling
of the patients and their escorts. Medical image
acquisition, storage, display and processing and image
transfer forms the telemedicine. This acquisition, storage
requires the enormous amount of data [1-4]. Therefore it
is often necessary to compress the image while storing
the necessary data for subsequent reconstruction [5]. The
performance of existing image coding standard generally
degrades at low bit rates because the underlying block
based discrete cosine transform (DCT) scheme [6].
Recently, the wavelet transform with the concept of
Multi-resolution Analysis (MRA) has emerged as a very
powerful tool for image data compression [7-9]. It
provides a vehicle for image processing application,
because it has ability to take into account Human Visual
System (HVS) characteristics, good energy compaction
capabilities under transmission and decoding. It is also

more robust under transmission and decoding error,
which results in compression ratio. Over the past few
years, a variety of powerful and sophisticated wavelet
based schemes for image compression have been
developed and implemented [10-14]. To achieve a
high compression rate, it is often necessary to choose
the best wavelet filter bank and decomposition level,
which will play a crucial role in compressing the
images. The selection of wavelet filters plays a
crucial part in achieving an effective coding
performance, because there is no filter that performs
the best for all images [15-17]. For better
performance in image compression, filters used in
wavelet transforms should have the property of
Orthonormality, Filter length, Vanishing order or
moment, Smoothness, Filter magnitude response,
Group delay, Decomposition level, Regularity
etc.[18][19]. Due to implementation constraints
scalar wavelets do not satisfy all these properties
simultaneously [20]. Relatively new class of wavelets
called Multiwavelets holds promise in obviating
some of the limitations of wavelet by possessing
more than one scale filters. Multiwavelets have
several advantages over scalar wavelets such features
as short support, orthogonality, symmetry, and high
number of vanishing moments, which are known to
be important in image processing [21-24].
Multiwavelet can achieve better level of performance
than scalar wavelets with similar computational
complexity. In this paper a multi-resolution system
based on Multiwavelets and a combination of
heterogeneous wavelet filters approach is proposed
for MRI image compression and the performance of
the system is analyzed experimentally.
This paper is organized as follows the multiresolution technique i.e. Wavelet and its properties
and also motivation behind multiwavelets for
compression are reviewed briefly in Section 2. The
proposed multi-resolution system is described in
Section 3. The experimental results and discussion on
MRI images are presented in section 4. Finally, the
concluding remarks are given in Section 5.

2 Wavelets (W) For Image compression:
2.1 Wavelets (W) and its Properties
The Practical implementation of wavelet
compression schemes is very similar to that of

subband coding schemes. As in the case of subband
coding, we decompose the signal (analyze) using filter
banks. The outputs of the filter banks are downsampled,
quantized, and encoded. The decoder decodes the coded
representation, upsamples, and recomposes the signal.
The figure 1 shows the two dimensional Discrete
Wavelet Transform Analysis (Decomposition) and
Figure 2 shows the synthesis (reconstruction)

Higher filter order gives more energy and increases
the complexity of calculating the DWT coefficients,
while lower order preserves the energy. i.e. it
preserves the important edge information. Therefore,
we must take care of wavelets in image compression
application concerning good balance between filter
orders, degree of smoothness and, computational
complexity. These properties depend on the image
contents. Vanishing order is the measure of
compaction property of the wavelet and it
corresponds to the number of zeros in the LL sub
band [23],[27].

2.2 Motivation behind Multiwavelets for
Compression

Figure 1 Two Dimensional DWT Analysis for 1
level

Figure 2 Two Dimensional DWT Synthesis of 1
level
The Current Compression system uses the biorthogonal
wavelet filters instead of orthogonal, because; orthogonal
filters have a property of energy preservation, whereas
biorthogonal filters lack it [25-26]. Orthogonal Filters
lead to orthogonal wavelet basis functions; therefore the
resulting wavelet transform is energy-preserving; this
implies that the Mean Square Error (MSE) introduced
during the quantization of the DWT coefficients is equal
to the MSE in the reconstructed signal. In biorthogonal
wavelet, the basis functions are not orthogonal; therefore
they do not preserve the energy but conserve it. The
efficiency of a transform depends on how much energy
compaction is provided by the transform; Wavelet Filter
can be used to analyze or decompose signals and images,
which is called Decomposition. The same components
can be assembled back into the original signal without
loss of information, which is called reconstruction or
synthesis. Shorter synthesis basis functions are desirable
for minimizing distortion that affects the subjective
quality of the image. Longer filters are responsible for
ringing noise in the reconstructed image at low bit rates
[23]. Each wavelet family is parameterized by an integer
N called the filter order, which is proportional to the
length of the filter. The length of the filter is related to
the degree of the smoothness of the wavelet and can
affect the coding performance. This relation is different
for different wavelet families and non-smoothness basis
function introduces artificial discontinuities, which are
reflected as spurious artifacts in the reconstructed images.

Algorithms based on wavelets have been shown to
work well in image compression. For better
performance in image compression, wavelets
transforms require filters that combine some of
desirable properties such as orthogonality, Symmetry
etc. However, the design possibilities for wavelets are
limited because they cannot simultaneously posses all
the desirable properties. In contrast to the limitations
of wavelets, Multiwavelets are able to posses the best
for all these properties simultaneously due to the
extra freedom in the design of multi-filters. Another
desirable feature of any transform used in image
compression is the amount of energy compaction
achieved. A filter with good energy compaction
property can decorrelate a fairly uniform input signal
into a small number of scaling coefficients containing
most of the energy and large number of sparse
wavelet coefficients. This becomes important factor
during quantization. Therefore better performance is
obtained when the wavelet coefficients have values
clustered about the zero with little variance to avoid
as much as quantization noise as possible. Thus
Multiwavelets have the potential to offer better
reconstructive quality of the same bit rate and can
achieve better level of performance than the wavelets
with a similar computational complexity [21[28].
2.2.1 Multiwavelets (MW): Multiwavelets are
similar to the wavelets but have some important
difference i.e. Multiwavelets are characterized with
several scaling functions and associated wavelet
functions [29],[30]. Let the scaling functions be
denoted in vector form as Φ(t) =[φ1(t), φ2(t), ,
φL(t)]T, where Φ(t) is called the multiscaling function,
T denotes the vector transpose and φj(t) is the jth
scaling function. Likewise, let the wavelets be
denoted as Ψ(t) = [ψ1(t), ψ2(t), . . . , ψL(t)]T, where
ψj(t) is the jth wavelet function. Then, the dilation
and wavelet equations for Multiwavelets take the
following forms, respectively:

Φ (t ) = 2

∞

∑ H Φ (2t − k )
k

k = −∞
∞

Ψ (t ) = 2 ∑ Gk Φ (2t − k )
k = −∞

……. (1)

The low-pass filter H and the high-pass filters G are N ×
N matrix filters, instead of scalars. In theory, N could be
as large as possible, but in practice it is usually chosen to
be two. This degree freedom can be used to incorporate
useful properties of the Multiwavelet such as
orthogonality, symmetry, and high order approximation
[22]. For single scaling and wavelet functions extend to
the matrix version. The resulting two channels, 2 × 2
matrix filter bank operates on two input data streams,
filtering them into four output streams. Each of these
streams is then downsampled by a factor of two. This
procedure is as shown in Figure-3

Figure3. Multiwavelet Filters with repeated input

2.2.2. Decomposition of Multiwavelets: In

scalar wavelet, during the single level of decomposition
the image data is replaced with four blocks
corresponding to the sub bands representing either lowpass or high-pass filtering in each direction (Horizontal,
Vertical, Diagonal and Approximation). Multiwavelets
have two channels, so that there will be two sets of
scaling and two sets of wavelets coefficients. 2-D
Multiwavelet decomposition has the 16 subband
intermediate image (single level decomposition) as
shown in figure-4.

Decomposition
As Scalar wavelet transforms give a single quarter sized
low-pass sub band from the original larger sub band. In
Multiwavelets, the multilevel decompositions are
performed in the same. Multiwavelet iterates on the lowpass coefficients from the previous decomposition; the
quarter image of “Low-pass” coefficients is actually a
2x2 sub bands.

The next step decomposes the “Low-Low-Pass” sub
matrix in the similar manner which gives the Second
level of Decomposition and as shown in Figure-5.. An N
number of Decomposition of a 2D image will produce
the 4(3N+1) subband (sub images)[29].

image Compression

Figure-6: Multi-Resolution system for MRI
image Compression.
The Proposed Multi-resolution system for MRI image
compression is shown in figure-6. Here the MRI
images are first decomposed into decomposition
filters and than transformed coefficients in each detail
sub band are pre-processed by keeping the number of
coefficients constant and then reconstruct the image
using the reconstruction filter coefficients.
3.1 Performance Metrics for Image Compression:
The source image is decomposed into sub bands,
which can be treated as sub images. At each level of
decomposition 16 sub images and they can be divided
into 4 blocks as shown in figure-2. The Low-Low
(LL) sub band block shows the image’s approximate
(this block includes four sub images). The Low-High
(LH) subband block, High-Low (HL) and High-High
(HH) block shows the detail part of the image in
Horizontal (H), Vertical (V) and Diagonal (D)
directions respectively. To get the next level again
decompose the approximate image i.e. Low-Low (LL)
sub bands and so on. The approximation sub image
shows the general trend of pixel values, and three
detail sub images show the Vertical, Horizontal and
Diagonal details or changes in the images. If these
details are very small, they can be set to zero without
significantly changing the image. The value, below
which, details are considered small enough to be set
to zero, is known as threshold. The greater the
number of zeros the greater the compression ratio.
The amount of information retained by an image after
compression and decompression is known as the
retained energy and this is proportional to the sum of
the square of the pixel values. If the energy retained
is 100% then the compression is known as Lossless;
as the image can be reconstructed exactly. This
occurs when the threshold value is set to zero,
meaning that the details have not been changed. If
any value is changed, then energy will be lost; this is
known as lossy compression. Ideally, during
compression, the number of zeros and the energy
retention should be as high as possible. However, as
more zeroes are obtained, more energy is lost; so a
balance between the two needs to be found [14-15].
Retain Energy (RE) and Number of Zeros (NZ) are
calculated by following formulas:

100 * (Vn (CCD,2)) 2
and
(Vn(origional Signal )) 2
100 * (ZCD)
NZ =
No. of coeificients

RE =

Where, Vn is the Vector norm, CCD is the coefficients
of the current decomposition and ZCD is the Number of
zeros of the current decomposition. The results also are
evaluated through Objective picture quality and they are
Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR).

4. Results and Discussion:
The MRI image compression results obtained using
multiwavelets based Multi-resolution system with
different
decomposition,
pre-processing
and
reconstruction filter banks by keeping with some number
of coefficients constant. The quality matrices, RMSE,
PSNR, Retain Energy (RE) and Number of Zeros (NZ)
are calculated. In this experiment work we have
calculated the above matrices with heterogeneous
wavelet filter bank approach. Firstly, we have done
experimental analysis by changing the decomposition
and reconstruction wavelets filter bank by keeping the
pre-processing filter bank same i.e. haar, d4, bi9, bi7, sa4
decomposition and reconstruction filter banks are
evaluated through bih5ap pre-processing filter banks. We
have achieved good compression with haar wavelet filter
bank; keeping a 1024 number of coefficients constant
and the results which are shown in Table-1 and Figure-2
give the comparative results of above mentioned filters.
We have also evaluated the performance by keeping the
decomposition and reconstruction same for 'haar' and
'd4'; by changing the pre-processing filter bank with
‘bih3ap’, ‘sa4ap’, ‘bighm2ap’, ‘id’ pre-processing filter
banks. The performance of 'haar' and 'd4' with different
pre-processing filters analyzed and compared with
different pre-processing filter banks. 'Haar' gives the
good compression by keeping the 1024 coefficients
constant. Among all the above pre-processing of filter
bank haar gives the good compression with ‘id’ preprocessing filter banks and the results which are shown
in Table 2 and Figure-3 gives the comparative results of
‘haar’ and ‘d4’ with various pre-processing filters. And
Figure-1 shows subjective results in related context. It is
observed that with different decomposition filter banks
and reconstruction banks gives the different compression
ratio while changing the different preprocessing filter
banks. If we increase constant number of coefficients the
compression ratio is less whereas the quality of the
image is good and vise versa.

5. Conclusion:
The performance of the compression and decompression
generally depends on the image characteristics. For the
images mostly low frequency contents (ordinary still
images) scalar wavelets give better performance.
However the Multiwavelets appear to excel at preserving
frequency contents, as medical images are normally high
frequency patterns. In this paper, we have highlighted the

compression
ratio for
Multiwavelets
with
heterogeneous wavelet filter bank approach. We have
focused how the compression ratio can increases by
selecting appropriate decomposition, reconstruction
and pre-processing filters. The compression ratio of
MRI image is determined by considering the RMSE,
PSNR, Retain Energy and Number of Zeros. We have
achieved good compression with haar wavelet filter
bank, keeping a 1024 number of co-efficient constant;
by keeping same pre-processing filter bank. Also we
have achieved good compression while changing the
different
pre-processing
filter
with
same
decomposition and reconstruction filter bank. It is
concluded that the compression ratio depends on the
type of image and type of transforms because, there is
no filter that performs the best for all images. Hence,
there is always necessary to select the appropriate
threshold value to get higher compression and the
minimum loss of image contents.
