Abstract
Typically, the shape preserving property for a parametric curve can be verified by checking for the total positivity
of the collocation matrix or finding the existence of corner
cutting algorithm as presented in [8]. However, there are
several cases that although the curve is satisfied the shape
preserving property, the shape of the curve does not preserve the shape of the control points, e.g., Delgado-Pe˜na
curves (DP curves). Hence, an alternative algorithm for
the shape preserving verification was proposed based on
five factors for verifying shape preserving property: the position of the control points, the order of the control points,
the type of the curve, the weights of the rational curves, and
the number of duplicate control points. Ultimately, four varieties of parametric curves, e.g., B´ezier , Said-Ball, WangBall and DP Curves, were verified and compared for their
shape preserving property.

1. Introduction
In 1959, B´ezier curves were firstly developed by Paul de
Casteljau, a physicist and mathematician at Citro¨en [4], but
independently established and publicized later in 1962 by
´
Pierre Etienne
B´ezier , an engineer at Renault [3]. Although
these curves were used in two different automobile companies, afterward they have been widely used in computeraided geometric design (CAGD) and computer graphics
systems because of its elegant and simple representation using Bernstein polynomials. In 1974, a cubic Ball basis was
introduced and used in Consurf systems [1, 2]. In 1987, the
generalized Ball polynomials for the higher degree of Ball
blending functions were presented by Wang [14] and independently introduced by Said in 1989 [12]. The work by
Wang has never been exposed because of Chinese language
until in 1996 Hu et al. [9] brought them in and named them
differently according to Wang-Ball and Said-Ball polynomials, respectively. This is because both curves share the

same Ball polynomials of degree 3. In addition, their recursive algorithms for calculating a point on the curves are
illustrated. In 2003, Delgado and Pe˜na [7] introduced a new
polynomial basis and claimed that the curve is normalized
totally positive (NTP), named by DP-Ball curves in [5, 10].
However, its cubic polynomials are not the same as of original Ball basis. Thus, for avoiding the confusion, the name
Delgado-Pe˜na or DP curve will be used instead. This mathematical property yields to an important requirement for
curve design, which is the shape preserving property. In
[8], the shape preserving properties of B´ezier and Said-Ball
curves are mathematically proven by verifying the NTP of
the collocation matrix while in [10] Wang-Ball curves were
verified not to have the shape preservation for the same reason.
Since 1991, the proof of shape preserving property of
a curve can be accomplished by verifying the totally positive (TP) or the existence of corner cutting algorithm of the
curve. Total positivity can be simply done by calculating
all minors of the collocation matrix. If they are all positive, then every curve of that kind of polynomials holds the
shape preserving property. From several observations, NTP
seems to be valid for some varieties of curves, e.g., B´ezier
and Said-Ball curves. However, it does not work for the
cases of DP curves even though they have claimed that their
curves are shape preserving as described in [7].
From Figure 1, it is obvious that there is only one shape
of DP curves no matter how locations of the control points
are placed. Moreover, the peaks of DP curves are merely
convergent to the middle (one or two) points of the sequence
of control points. This implies that these one or two midpoints have highly influenced on the shape of the DP curves.
For examples, in Figure 1, the bending corner of DP curve is
convergent to the third control point while Figure 2 shows
that the bending corner of the curve is convergent to the
midpoint of the third and the fourth control points.
Furthermore, the Wang-Ball curves are the farthest curve
from its control points compared to the others. Even though
the shapes of Wang-Ball curves mimic their control points,

DP curves, can be described as follows:

through the first and the last endpoints of the control
points. Thus, the first and the last endpoints intuitively
influence the shape of the curve.

2. Convex Hull Property: All parametric curves lie inside the convex hull of their control points, i.e., their
polynomials are nonnegative and sum to 1. B´ezier
control points can be transformed from Said-Ball [13],
Wang-Ball [6] and DP control points [5], respectively.
Thus, B´ezier control points lie inside the convex hull of
the three kinds of control points because B´ezier control
points can be written in terms of Said-Ball, Wang-Ball
and DP control points.
3. Polynomial Symmetry Property: Two curves that
correspond to the two different orders of control points
look the same. Technically, they are different only in
the direction in which they are traversed. Thus, each
polynomial of these four parametric curves is symmetric with respect to t and 1 − t (see Figure 3).

Parametric polynomial curves have some important
properties that make them well suited for geometric modelling. Exploring these properties and their semantics provides a great deal of insight into the shape preserving property of the curves. The common properties of these four
parametric curves, e.g., B´ezier , Said-Ball, Wang-Ball and

the distance from a point on the curve and its corresponding point on the line segment connecting to every control
point is the greatest. However, it can be noticed that both
Wang-Ball and DP curve do not possess the shape preserving property because the control points of the curve cannot
preserve the shape of that curve.

4. Pseudolocal Control: Each polynomial, namely ith
polynomial of degree n (e.g., Bernstein polynomial,
Bin (t)), has only one maximum and attains it at t =
i/n, where i = 0, . . . , n. If only one control point
(ith control point) is moved, then the shape of the
curve will be mostly affected in the region of the curve
around this parametric variable t = i/n.
5. Polynomial Derivative: The maximum value of each
polynomial can be obtained at t = i/n, where i =
0, . . . , n, or by calculating the parametric variable t in

the polynomial derivative = 0. At a particular t, the
actual values of all polynomials sum to 1. This is obviously appeared both at the first and the last endpoints.
This causes the endpoint interpolation. Hence, they influence the shape of the curve. Furthermore, the third
maximum value of the polynomials is also taken into
account whether it affects the shape of the curve. From
observations, the third maximum, denoted by ith polynomial of degree n, has, more or less, some effects on
the shape of the curve. In order to find the third maximum, the derivatives of blending functions are set to
0 and then solve the equations to find the maximum
among those solutions. The comparison of each polynomial derivative of four curves will be expressed in
section 4.
6. Polynomial Integral: The integral of each polynomial
sum to 1. The comparison of each polynomial Integral
of four curves will also be shown in section 4.

3. Shape Preserving Property
From the previous section, those properties can lead to an
important property. That is the shape preserving property.
In order to verify the shape preserving property, only the
calculation of total positivity of the collocation matrix is not
enough. The reason is there are five important factors that
influence to the shape of the curves:
1. The position of the control points
2. The order of the control points
3. The type of the curve, i.e., the blending functions or
the polynomials related to the curve variety
4. The weights of the rational curves, and
5. The number of duplicate control points.
In Figure 4, the shape of B´ezier and Said-Ball curves
are changed according to each position of the control points
while Wang-Ball and DP curves are not. The fourth control
point influences the shape of DP curve the most while in
Figure 5, the midpoint between the fourth and the fifth control points influences the shape of the curve. In Wang-Ball
curves, it seems that the shapes of Wang-Ball curves are not
much changed relatively to their control points.
Figure 6 illustrates four sets of B´ezier , Said-Ball, WangBall and DP control points of the same curve. In other
words, this curve is represented by different sets of control points and different blending functions. It is obvious
that the same B´ezier control points are closest to the curve
compared to Said-Ball, Wang-Ball and DP control points,

respectively. This is another good example that shows the
DP curve does not preserve the shape of its control points.
In the cases that there are a number of consecutive duplicate control points, the shape of the curve will be changed
by those duplicate control points. Let k be the number of
duplicate control points, Figure 7 shows the different shapes
of four curves with the same set of control points but the
replications are occurred at the third control point. We can
see that the curve is converged to the third control point.
Hence, the convergent direction, shown by the shape of the
curve, to a particular control point can imply that that control point influences the shape of the curve for some specific
reasons.
In this work, a technique for the verification of shape
preserving property was proposed based on the factors mentioned above. It is quite obvious that the control points and
their order significantly influence to the shape of the curve.
The weights are omitted in this article because only nonrational curves are considered. The cases of duplicate control points are rarely found in real and not practically used
for curve modeling. Thus, the blending functions are seriously concerned in this paper.

4. A Proposed Shape Preserving Verification
Technique
The shape-preserving property is a simple requirement
for curve modeling. Since 1991, there have been only two
techniques used to verify whether non-rational curves hold
shape-preserving property [8]: checking for the normalized
total positivity (NTP) or seeking for the existence of the corner cutting algorithm. Total positivity of a curve can be
satisfied by checking whether the parametric curve is for-

mulated by TP basis. A basis is TP if its collocation matrix
is TP, i.e., all its minors are non-negative [11]. If a curve is
proven to be TP, then the shape of the curve preserves the
shape of its control polygon. The latter method is to check
for the existence of the corner cutting algorithm which obtains the B´ezier control points from the verified curves control points.
There are three parametric curves, e.g. B´ezier , Said-Ball
and DP curves, proven to be totally positive. Consequently,
the shapes of these curves preserve the shape of their control
points [7, 8], while Wang-Ball curve does not. Among these
curves, B´ezier curve has been known to be the best approximation of the control polygon because the curve is closest
to its control polygon. However, it is also not suspicious for
the shape-preserving property of the Said-Ball curves, except for the DP curves. This leads to the question whether
only calculating for TP is enough for the shape-preserving
verification. In this work, an algorithm for shape preserving
verification is proposed.

polynomials of degree n with B´ezier control points, denoted
by {bi }ni=0 , {P0n (t), P1n (t), . . . , Pnn (t)} be a basis for nth polynomials with control points, denoted by {pi }ni=0 , and

Proof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 1.
From the previous two lemmas, it is obvious that if the
shape of the curve preserves the shape of control points,
then the shape of the curve is also influenced by its polynomials or its blending functions. This leads to the proposed
algorithm.

It is noticed here that the maximum deviation values
of the integrals of Wang-Ball and DP polynomials are
0.132623 and 0.212186, which are significantly high. Thus,
both polynomials do not preserve the shape of their curves
and neither do their control points.
The integral values of four parametric curves of order 7
and 8 are illustrated in Figure 8 and 9, respectively. From
the figures, the midpoint and two midpoints of the even and
odd degree DP curves, respectively, influence the shape of
the curves the most because they have the high magnitude
occurred at those control point positions.

5. Conclusion and Discussions
In this paper, an algorithm for the verification of shape
preserving property of a curve is proposed by testing its
polynomials or basis functions. This method is based on
the intuitive idea that the shape of the curve is influenced
by not only the control points and their order, but also its
blending functions. In other words, the curve polynomials
preserve the shape of the curve. This is also reasonable for
both mathematical points of view and the observations.
In this study, the shape preserving technique can verify
whether not only the polynomials preserve the shape of the
curve but also comparing the quantity of shape preservation among four varieties of parametric curves. The result
is Bernstein polynomials preserve the shape of B´ezier curve
better than the Said-Ball polynomials. The Said-Ball polynomials preserve the shape of Said-Ball curve better than
Wang-Ball and DP polynomials. However, Wang-Ball and
DP polynomials do not meet the shape preserving requirements.
