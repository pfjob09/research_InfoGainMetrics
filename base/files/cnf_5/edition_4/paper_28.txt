Abstract
The

construction
2

of a

range restricted

bivariate C interpolant to scattered data is
considered in which the interpolant is positive
everywhere if the original data are positive.
Sufficient conditions are derived on Bézier points
in order to ensure that surfaces comprising quintic
Bézier triangular patches are always positive and
2

satisfy C continuity conditions. The first and
second derivatives at the data sites are then
calculated (and modified if necessary) to ensure
that these conditions are satisfied. Its construction
is local and easily extended to include as upper and
lower constraints to the interpolating surfaces of
the form z = C(x,y) where C is a polynomial of
degree less or equal to 5. A number of examples
are presented.

in term of mean and maximum absolute errors with
previous results in [13] are presented in section 5.
Finally, the conclusion will be given in Section 6.

2. Sufficient Positivity Conditions for a
Quintic Bézier Triangular Patch
Consider a triangle T (as in Figure 1), with
vertices V1(x1, y1), V2(x2 ,y2), V3(x3, y3), and
barycentric coordinates u,v,w such that any point
V(x, y) on the triangle can be expressed as V = uV1
+ vV2 + wV3 , where u + v + w = 1 and u v,w ≥ 0.

1. Introduction
Various methods concerning with visualization
of surface data to preserve positivity using bivariate
functions such as in [1], [2], [9], [11] and [12]
concentrate only on generating the resulting C1
smooth surfaces. As far as we know, very little
effort or no attempt has been made to extend the
various schemes to enable interested parties to
visualize C2 surfaces from scattered data.
Motivated our previous work in [12] and the
second author’s work in [13], this paper will
propose sufficient conditions be derived on Bézier
points in order to ensure that surfaces comprising
quintic Bézier triangular patches are always
positive and satisfy C2 continuity conditions. Each
triangular patch of the interpolating surface is
formed as a convex combination of three quintic
Bézier triangular patches (as in [3]) and thus
require inputs up to the second-order partial
derivatives at vertices of the triangles. Initial values
of inner Bézier ordinates will be estimated using
cross boundary derivatives and C2 continuity
conditions across shared edge of adjacent triangles.
We begin by deriving sufficient conditions on
Bézier ordinates which ensure the positivity of
quintic Bézier patches in section 2. An outline of
the surface construction is given in section 3, while
section 4 presents the implementation of rangerestricted interpolation. Examples and comparison

Figure 1 : Triangle T
A quintic Bézier triangular patch P on T is defined
as

P(u,v,w) =
∑ bijk Bijk5 ( u,v,w )

where

Bijk5 ( u,v,w ) =

Let the Bézier ordinates at vertices be strictly
positive, i.e. b500, b050, b005 > 0. Sufficient
conditions on the remaining Bézier ordinates shall
be derived to ensure the entire Bézier patch to be
positive. For simplicity in writing the Bézier
ordinates at vertices, let A = b500, B = b050, and C =
b005. Our approach is to find the lowest bound on
the remaining Bézier ordinates, such that if all the
Bézier ordinates apart from A, B, C, have this
value, then P(u,v,w) = 0. We thus assume that, the
remaining Bézier ordinates have the same value -r
(where r > 0). So, (1) can now be written as,

∑ rBijk5 (u,v,w). (2)

P(u, v,w) = Au5 + Bv5+Cw5 -

i + j+ k = 5
i ≠ 5, j ≠ 5, k ≠ 5

∑

Since

i + j + k =5
i ≥ 0 , j ≥ 0 ,k ≥ 0

∑

i + j + k =5
i ≠ 5 , j ≠ 5 ,k ≠ 5

Pmin ( u,v,w ) =

Bijk5 ( u,v,w ) = 1, then

Bijk5 ( u,v,w ) + u5 +v5 + w5 = 1.

Thus,
P(u,v, w) = Au5 + Bv5 + Cw5- r (1- u5-v5-w5 )

(3)

Clearly P(u, v, w) > 0, when r = 0. We are
interested to find the value of r = r0 when the
minimum value of P(u, v, w) = 0. The partial
derivatives of P in (3) with respect to u, v and w are
given by,

To obtain the value of s0 for given values of A, B
and C, we need to calculate the root of (7) that will
give a lower bound on the remaining Bézier
ordinates, i.e. r0 = 1/s0. We can use a simple

iterative scheme which must ensure one-sided
convergence, i.e. that s0 is approached from above.
The convexity of G(s) means that this can be
achieved using the method of false-position as in
[13] (see [4] for further details). An initial estimate
for the root will be the value of s for which the line
joining 80/N and 80/M has the value 1 as shown in
Figure 2. Thus, we obtain the following
Proposition.
Proposition. Consider the quintic Bézier
triangular patch P(u, v, w) with b500 = A, b050 = B,
b005 = C, where A, B, C > 0. If bijk ≥ -r0 = -1/s0 ,
(i,j,k) ≠ (5,0,0), (0,5,0) and (0,0,5), where s0 is the

≥ 0, ∀ u, v, w ≥ 0, u + v + w = 1.
Note that, in practice, if any of the values of A, B,
or C are zero (i.e. the given data are not strictly
positive), we will assign the value zero to r0 for that
triangle.

3. Construction of C2 positivitypreserving interpolating surface
We want to construct a C2 positivitypreserving surface F(x,y) which interpolates given
scattered data, (xi, yi ,zi ), i=1,2,…,N, where zi > 0.
The surface comprises quintic Bézier triangular
patches, each of which is guaranteed to remain
positive. We use Delaunay triangulation to
triangulate the convex hull of the data points (xi,yi).
Estimation of first order partial derivatives of F
will be obtained by using the method proposed in
[7]. For second order partial derivatives estimation,
we will use the quadratic approximation of least
squares method i.e.

(

min ∑ ax i 2 + bx i y i + cy i 2 + dx i + ey i + f − z i

)

2

i

where a, b, c, d, e and f are the coefficients to be
determined. The second order partial derivatives at
vertex Vi can then be estimated by Fxx= 2a, Fxy=b,
Fyy=2c. We will refer to b500, b050, b005 as Bézier
ordinates at vertices, b410, b401, b140, b041, b014, b104,
b320, b302, b230, b032, b023, b203 as boundary Bézier
ordinates and b311, b131, b113, b122, b212, b221 as inner
Bézier ordinates respectively (see Figure 3). From
given data, F(Vi )and estimated partial derivatives
Fx, Fy, Fxx, Fyy, Fxy at vertex Vi, we can determine
all the control points bijk except for the three inner
control points b122, b221, b212. For instance (refer to
Figures 1 and 3), at vertex V1, we shall obtain the
following six control points:
b500 = F (V1 ) , b410 = b500 + De3 (V1 ) / 5 ,
b401 = b500 − De 2 (V1 ) / 5 ,

where

De 2 (V1 ) = ( x1 − x 3 ) Fx (V1 ) + ( y1 − y 3 ) F y (V1 )
De23e3 (V1 ) = ( x 2 − x1 ) 2 Fxx (V1 ) +
2( x 2 − x1 )( y 2 − y1 ) Fxy (V1 ) + ( y 2 − y1 ) 2 F yy (V1 )
De22e 2 (V1 ) = ( x1 − x 3 ) 2 Fxx (V1 ) +
2( x1 − x 3 )( y1 − y 3 ) Fxy (V1 ) + ( y1 − y 3 ) 2 F yy (V1 )

De23e 2 (V1 ) = ( x1 − x 3 )( x 2 − x1 ) Fxx (V1 ) +
[( x1 − x 3 )( y 2 − y1 ) + ( x 2 − x1 )( y1 − y 3 )]Fxy +
( y1 − y 3 )( y 2 − y1 ) F yy (V1 ).

Similarly, the other 12 Bezier ordinates can be
obtained using input data at vertices V2 and V3,
respectively. However, initial estimates of the
above ordinates may not satisfy the positivity
condition for P. With regard to our Proposition, we
need these Bézier ordinates to be greater or equal to
-r0. If they are not, then the magnitudes of Fx, Fy,
Fxx, Fyy and Fxy at the vertices need to be reduced
so that the condition is satisfied. The modification
of these partial derivatives at vertex Vi, is achieved
by multiplying each derivative at that vertex, by a
scaling factor 0 <αi < 1, i = 1, 2, 3. The smallest
value of αi is obtained by considering all triangles
Tt, t = 1, …, k that meet at vertex O, which satisfy
the positivity condition of all these triangles (see
Figure 4). Determination of scaling factor αi for
each vertex is done as follows: Consider say, a
triangle T1 of a triangulation domain with vertices

O, A and B. Let O =V1, B =V2, C =V3. At vertex
V1, scalar β j , j = 1,2, . . . 5 are defined as follows:
1. If F (V0 ) + De1 / 5 < − r0 , then
β 1 = − 5((r0 ) i + F (V0 )) / De1 , otherwise β 1 = 1,
2. if F (V0 ) − De 2 / 5 < − r0 , then
β 2 = 5(r0 + F (V0 )) / De 2 , otherwise β2 = 1,
3. if F (V0 ) + C1 /5 < - r0
then β 3 = 5(r0 + F (V0 )) / C1 , otherwise β3 = 1,
4. if F (V0 ) − C 2 / 5 < − r0 then
β 4 = 5((r0 ) i + F (V0 )) / C 2 , otherwise β4 = 1 and
5. if F (V0 ) + C 3 / 5 < − r0 then
β 5 = − 5((r0 ) i + F (V0 )) / C 3 , otherwise β5 = 1
where C1= [2 De1 (V0 ) + De21e1 (V0 ) / 4] , C2 =

[2 De 2 (V0 ) − De22e 2 (V0 ) / 4] and C3 =
[ De1 (V0 ) + De 2 (V0 ) − De22e 2 (V0 ) / 4] .
Then we define γ 1 = min ( β 1 , β 2 , β 3 , β 4 , β 5 ) at
vertex V0 of T1. We can obtain all γ t , t = 2, 3, . . .,
k using similar steps as above. Finally, in order for
all five Bezier ordinates adjacent to V0 to fulfill the
positivity condition in the Proposition, we will
choose α 1 = min ( γ 1 , γ 2 , . . ., γ k ) . The above
process is then repeated at all Vi of the triangulation
in order to obtain all the scaling factors αi, i = 1,2,3.
The adjusted Bézier ordinates except for b122, b221,
b212 of the whole triangular patches that satisfy the
Proposition can then be calculated.
For each triangle, the inner Bézier ordinates b122,
b221, b212 remain to be calculated, in such a way to
guarantee preservation of positivity and to ensure
C2 continuity across patch boundaries. We shall use
similar method as in [3] to determine initial
estimates of these ordinates. A local scheme Pi, i =
1,2, 3 is defined by replacing b122, b221, b212 with
i
i
i
b122
, b212
, b221
respectively which will satisfy C2

,
conditions across boundary ei. Ordinates b122
2

b212
, b221
are obtained using cross boundary
derivatives on edges e1, e2, e3 respectively. These
ordinates will then be used to estimate the
1

remaining local ordinates i.e. b212
, b221
, b122
,
2
3
3
b221
, b122
, b212
(see [3] for further details). Initial
estimates of these Bézier ordinates in each triangle
may not satisfy the positivity condition of P(u,v,w)
as stated in the Proposition. Now, we shall describe
i
i
i
a method to adjust b122
, b212
, b221
for each local
scheme in order to satisfy the Proposition. Let TA
and TB be two adjacent quintic Bézier triangular
patches with a common boundary curve (see Figure
4). In order to achieve C2 continuity along shared
edge, the conditions involving ordinates to be
adjusted are given as follows [6]:

b122
and c122
, we can now adjust b212

and c212
to satisfy the Proposition and C2
conditions in (10) and (11) respectively. For the
1
boundary case, if b212
and c1221 < –r0, we reset
both ordinate values to be –r0.

The final interpolating surface P is then defined
as a convex combination of all local schemes in
order for sufficient conditions on all sides of the
triangles to be satisfied, i.e.
P(u,v,w) = c1P1(u,v,w) + c2P2(u,v,w) + c3P3(u,v,w)
or
P (u , v, w) =

4. Range-restricted interpolation
In the previous section, we have described the
construction of C2 interpolating surface which is
constrained to lie above the plane z = 0. We shall
extend our scheme to include a larger set of
constraint surfaces that are of the form z = C(x, y)
where C(x, y) is a constant, linear, quadratic, cubic
quartic or quintic polynomial, i.e.

C ( x, y ) =
+

constructed piecewise as a single quintic triangular
patch, where G(x,y) is also a single piecewise
quintic triangular patch. We can use a similar
construction method if the data points lie below the
constraint surface by writing G(x,y) as C(x,y) –
F(x,y). The above construction method can be
extended to describe the interpolating surface that
lie between both the upper and lower constraint
surfaces.

Our first example taken from [9] consists of 63
data points of a positive function, f in
domain D = ( −1, 4 ) x( −1.4 ,1.4 ), where
f ( x, y ) = ( x + 1 )2 ( x − 1 )2 ( y + 1 )2 ( y − 1 )2 , ( x, y )∈ D.
The interpolating surface that does not preserve
positivity of the original data is given in Figure 5
When
our
where min f ( x, y ) = − 0.0907.

proposed positivity-preserving scheme is applied,
the corresponding surface is shown in Figure 6
where min f ( x, y ) = 0.

where ai, i=0,…,5, bj, j=0,. . .,4, ck, k=0,. . .,3, dl,
l=0,…,2, em, m=0,1 and f are real numbers. These
surfaces are considered because they can be
expressed as quintic Bézier triangular patches on
each triangle of the triangular mesh. Thus, C2
piecewise polynomial surfaces consisting of
polynomial pieces of the form z = C(x , y) on the
triangulation of data sites can also be treated as
constraint surfaces.
We would like to generate a C2 interpolating
surface z = F(x, y) through data points (xi, yi, zi) , i
= 1, 2, . . ., N which lies either above or below the
constraint surface or lie between both constraint
surfaces. This problem can be easily reduced to the
problem of positivity-preserving interpolation
which we have considered earlier. Assume the data
points lie above the constraint surface. The initial
problem of constructing interpolation surface
F(x,y) with respect to constraint surface C(x,y) is
similar to the construction of a function G(x,y) =
F(x,y) – C(x,y) such that G is positive and C2 with
G(xi,yi) = z i* , where z i* = zi – C(xi,yi) is a new set
of data points. As described earlier, the positivitypreserving interpolation surface F(x,y) is

Note that g ∈[ 0,1 ] in D. In this later example, we
apply our range restricted method using lower and
upper constraint planes, z = 0 and z = 1,
respectively. The interpolating surface without
imposing these constraints is displayed in Figure 7.
Clearly, the surface crosses both constraint planes
with min g ( x, y ) = − 0.1087 and max g ( x, y )
( x , y )∈D

( x , y )∈D

= 1.0866. After applying these constraints, the
interpolating surface stays in between these two
planes where min g ( x, y ) = 0 and

imposing lower and upper constraints on the
generated final surface.

6. Conclusion
In this study, we have considered the generation of
positivity-preserving interpolation using quintic
triangular Bézier patches by imposing relaxed and
simpler conditions on Bézier ordinates which was
similarly done previously for C1 cubic triangular
patches generated in [13]. We also extend the
problem of C2 positivity-preserving interpolants to
the case of range restricted scattered data by
