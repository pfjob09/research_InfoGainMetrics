Abstract
Noise reduction is one of the most important
processes to enhance the quality of reconstructed
image. In this paper, we present an adaptive blockbased singular value decomposition method for noise
reduction. Instead of applying block-based singular
value decomposition (BSVD) directly to noisy images,
we propose to apply BSVD on the noisy edge image
version obtained from the difference between the
original noisy image and its blur image version. From
the experimental results, we demonstrate that our
proposed approach compared with traditionally
methods can remove noise, preserve edges as well as
effectively smooth in the homogenous region.
Therefore, our method leads to a practical method to
be used for noise reduction.

1. Introduction
Noise reduction is an essential issue in the field of
digital image processing. When filtering random noise
from a noisy image, there are two main issues need to
be considered, which are how much noise had been
removed, and how well edges are preserved without
blurring. Traditionally, there are several simple
techniques for noise suppression such as moving
average filtering and Gaussian filtering. However,
they can effectively suppress noise but it fail to
preserve many useful detail, being merely a lowpass
filter [1]. In the past decades, there had been
considerably interest in using the wavelet transform as
a powerful tool for recovering signal from noisy data.
This method is generally referred to as wavelet
shrinkage techniques. In 1995, Donoho presented a soft
thresholding method for denoising in 1-D signal [2].
Chang, Yu and Vetterli introduced an adaptive wavelet
thresholding for image denoising and compression [3].
They proposed a new shringkage method, BaeyShrink,
which also outperformed Donoho and Johnstone’s

Sureshrink. However, wavelet denoising method has
two main drawbacks, which are the choice of the
threshold and the specific distributions of the signal
and noise may not be well matched at different scales
[4]. In 1997, Konstantinides, Natarajan and Yovanof
introduced noise estimation and SVD filtering using
block-based singular value decomposition (BSVD)
[5,6]. They divided the whole image matrix into each
8X8 block size, which are much less in computation
time demanding. They demonstrated that BSVD
outperformed soft thresholding method that even with
Donoho’s optimal threshold, the filtered image are
quite blurry. In addition, an approach for image
denoising by performing SVD filtering in detail
subbands of wavelet domain was proposed [7].
In this research study, we concentrate on noise
reduction filtering based on BSVD algorithm, which is
suitable for image noise reduction. However, this
method can perform well to preserve image detail
(edge) but fail to smooth in the homogeneous region
pointed out by Hou [7]. Therefore, our goal is to
present an adaptive BSVD filtering for noise reduction
method. In contrast to apply BSVD on the noisy image
directly [5], we propose to apply BSVD on the noisy
edge image version obtained from the difference
between the original noisy image and its blur image
version. Gaussian filter is used to apply to original
noising image to get a blur image version. From the
experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed
approach can suppress noise, preserve edge as well as
effectively smooth in the homogenous region.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
provides a brief introduction of SVD. Section 3
contains SVD based noise reduction. In Section 4, the
proposed method is introduced and explained. Section
5 gives some experimental results to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally,
concluding remarks are given in section 6.

2. Singular Value Decomposition
Every matrix A of m × n size (m ≥ n) can be
decomposed into a product of three matrices,
n
KK
A = USV T = ∑ si ui v it

(1)

i =1

Where U and V are orthogonal matrices with column

vectors ui and vi , and S = diag ( si , s2 ,..., sn ) ,
which is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements of
S can be arranged in a descending order called the
singular values of A and [5],

s1 ≥ s2 ≥ ... ≥ sn

(2)

3. SVD filtering for noise reduction
For SVD filtering, it decomposes the column space
of observation matrix into a dominant and subordinate
part, which can be attributed to the noise-free signal
and noise [7]. To suppress noise, we need to keep the
energy in the signal subspace and get rid of the energy
in noisy subspace. In this paper, we used SVD to
decompose image by size nxn into n subbands
50

Each subband has only one singular value. The
singular value will effect to the Signal to Noise Ratio
(SNR) of each image subband.
Figure 1 shows SNR versus singular value between
original image and noisy image subband. As can be
seen, the larger singular values mean the more SNR. If
singular value less than zero, the information is less
than noise of its subband.

4. Proposed method
BSVD is a good method for noise suppression while
preserving information detail of image data. However,
it is not a good method when applying to the
homogenous region because this method can cause unsmooth result on the smooth region [7]. Therefore, we
introduce an adaptive BSVD method to suppress noise
as well as smooth in homogenous area. The flow chart
of our proposed method is shown in figure 2. In
contrast to apply BSVD on the noisy image directly
[5], we propose to apply BSVD on the noisy edge
image version obtained from the difference between
the original noisy image and its blur version. Finally,
the reconstructed image is performed by the
combination of the BSVD noise reduction image result
with its blur image version.

Next, we focus on to find the optimal σ of the
Gaussian filter and the best possible block size of
BSVD in order to get the best performance for noise
reduction. To evaluate the performance of noise
reduction, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and
Edge measurement (Edge) are used [8],

The model of noisy image with additive noise can be
written as,

N =I+E

(5)

where N is an noisy image , I is an original image
and E is Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard
deviation σ . When we apply Gaussian filter to the
noisy image, the noisy image can be approximately
equivalent to,

N ≈ ( I1 ) + ( I 2 + E )

 MAX I 2 
PSNR = 10 ⋅ log 

 MSE 

dB

where MAXI is the maximum pixel value of the image.
When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per
sample, MAXI is equivalent to 255 and the Mean
Square Error (MSE) is given by,

Figure 3 shows the original image compared with
original noisy image and their blur and edge image
versions. In this process, the Barbara image was
blurred by Gaussian filter. Next, edge of image ( I 2 ) is
found by minus the original image (N) by its blur
image version ( I1 ). To compare between edge image
and blur image of original image and noisy image,
noise is dominant on an edge map more than blur
version. Therefore, we proposed to reduce noise on the
noisy edge image version ( I 2 +E) using BSVD
filtering.

In this experiments, Barbara image size 512x512, at
8-bpp resolution is used. The Gaussian noise zero
mean, noise variance 100 is added to original Barbara
image. As the results, figure 4 show that the optimal
value σ of Gaussian filter approximately equal to 1
that provides the best performance both in PSNR and
Edge measurements. While the optimal block size of
BSVD, as can be seen in figure 5, block size 16 is
slightly better than block size 8 but computation cost is
demanding. Then, block size 8 is the best suitable.
In addition, we compare our proposed approach
with other conventional approaches such as Gaussian
filter, BSVD, DWT denosing (soft thresholding). The
noise variances are varied from 25 to 169. The result is
shown in figure 6. We can see that our proposed
approach out performs all traditional methods.

In table 1-4, the proposed method performs the best
in PSNR and edge measurements even high textures
image (Goldhill) or smooth image (Face). In figure 8,
we also zoom the image results in the area of texture
and smooth region (Barbara face). As can be seen, our
proposed approach can suppress noise, preserve edge
and smooth in the homogenous region, especially
noticeable on the Barbara face area. Furthermore, our
proposed approach can improve PSNR and Edge
measurement either image perturbed by quite or small
noise. The average computing time for our approach
were 0.17 second and 1.078 second to run on 256X256
and 512X512 (8–bpp), respectively using Matlab 7.0
on a Laptop, HP Pavilion DV6108TX, with Intel Core

6. Conclusion
This paper presents an effective noise reduction
method, an adaptive block based Singular value
decomposition (BSVD) filtering, which can reduce
noise, preserve edge (detail information) as well as
effectively smooth in the homogenous image area. We
also compared our proposed approach with other
methods. The comparison suggests that the proposed
method results are competitive and outperforming with
other methods. However, the problem for this scheme
is the optimal threshold value for various noise
variances of BSVD filtering, which should be carefully
chosen. Future work, a method to find an optimal
threshold for various noise variances will be
considered in order to get the better performance.
