Abstract
Aerial photos with LiDAR data were processed with
genetic algorithms for not only the feature extraction but
also orthographical image. DSM provided by LiDAR
reduced the amount of GCPs needed for the regular
processing, thus the reason both of the efficiency and
accuracy are highly improved.
Keywords--- GA, LiDAR, Feature Extraction.

1. Introduction
The need for precise Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
in producing the stereo images have been a time and cost
consuming tasks for all the image processing work
(Lillesabd and Kiefer, 1999). Beside the existing data
base, one can only create the matching DTM from stereo
pairs of incoming images. For that, large amount of
ground control points (GCPs) are needed, so is the stereo
images that fit within the pre-defined conditions. Three
dimensional virtual reality (3D VR) is one of the
particular usage that require much dense DTM grid than
others. LiDAR could provide both the DTM and DSM at
one aerial data gathering, point cloud data thus convert
into DTM grid within error of 15 cm. In a few days of
processing time, the DTM grid with meters level interval
is ready for the processing. At this project, the co-axis
digital aerial camera and LiDAR machine are arranged to
inquire the data simultaneously, therefore one image has
associated DTM/DSM along with it that makes the
orthographic handling much easer and also faster.
Matching the ground features with image pixels
automatically with high precision have been a
challenging work for many decays. Genetic algorithms
could search the global domain, and also reject the
candidates with large bias automatically. With it, one can
match the DSM to image with much less human
interactive. Once the orthographic image was processed,
GAs was brought into for unsupervised feature extraction
and also for the producing of 3D VR.

IDL and ENVI package were used for data handling
and also the orthographic image processing, the GA code
was developed with C code and it can be run at any
window base system.
An 2 km X 2 km checking ground have been used to
verify the outcome of this study. The DTM of this testing
site was carried out by GPS-RTK survey at 10 meters
interval with errors of 5 cm at each component. Another
1/1000 aerial photos are also taken with 40 GCPs, and
adequate overlap (65%) to insure the stereo digital image
mapping could be performed. Orthographic image with
LiDAR and digital camera and its associated DTM
match the ground measurements within errors of 20 cm.

2.Data Gathering
LiDAR data was gathered by Optech 3070 with
onboard GPS and IMU system to get both of the precious
footprints in the navigation stage and also accurate
locations of aircraft to get the exact coordinates of
ground laser reflected points (Beiser, 1974). Imagery was
captured by Optech digital camera with image size of
4077 x 4092 pixels, several GCPs occupied by GPS was
distributed with every 10 km interval at ground to
provide the ground true control. LiDAR machine was
operated with digital camera simultaneously to gather the
co-axial ground image so is the DTM. Operating photos
of LiDAR and digital camera is illustrated at Figure 1.

Original data captured by this digital camera is
shown at Figure 2. The DTM and DSM gathered by
LiDAR for the same region were shown at Figure 3 & 4,
respectively.

3.Data handling
DSM data and its associated original aerial image
was processed into orthographic image by ENVI with no
need of the stereo image pairs. Entire process took about
10 minutes at Pentium 4 1.4 G CPU machine with
Windows XP and 4G ram for one image of 50 M in size.
Result shown in Figure 5.

To reduce the process error, it is necessary to
increase the accuracy of matching the feature points at
ground to the corresponding points at image. The genetic
algorithm (GA) was brought into this stage for
performing the fuzzy matching with weighting index
method. Genetic algorithm follow the fundamental sprits
of natural selection, by using the crossover and mutation
two distinct functions to reach the global extreme
meanwhile rule out the improper candidates at early
stage to reduce the unnecessary handling routines
Goldberg, 1989). Subset of the image converted into
matrix with DNs with its associated location as genes.
All the digital number that derived from image DNs
become as chromosome. Method of Run Length
Encoding (RLE) to transform the serious of digital data
as vectors (Mather, 1999). These steps was performed at
both of the image and also LiDAR data, then matching
index was conducted first at the region that possess the
GCP, once the so called “tie point” been found. GA code
then computes the scale, orientation, rotation, skewing,
tilts difference between these two data set. All the
processing was performed with real number GA instead
of regular binary method for the purpose of cutting off
the converting time from binary to real number back and
fore. For doing such, we have reduce the need of human
interact and also the amount of necessary GCPs with the
same accuracy and much less time.

The same techniques were used to conduct the 3
dimensional image processing for the purpose of virtual
realization and also 3D flight simulation, too. One of the
senses was captured and shown as figure 6, the avi file
for the 3D movie is available and will be shown at the
presentation.

LiDAR and Digital Camera at Central Taiwan.

4.Feature Extraction with Wavelet
To perform automatic unsupervised or supervised
image classification or feature extraction from images,
raster to vector, is the most important and also time
consuming task for data converting into GIS ready usage.
Wavelet is used to automatic sorting the images contains
regions with contrast above predefined threshold, then
classify the marked region into landslide and river band
also with wavelet analysis of DNs (Canny, 1986). Such
technique could not only apply on the aerial photos but
also satellite images, too. Classified image file with
wavelet is shown at Figure 7, it is clear to see the region
with higher contrast have been marked. By choosing the
proper wavelet family and also the order of filter
function, it is fully automatic process. We have
processed total 285 aerial photos that covered about 1000
km2 with wavelet in about 2.5 hours and the producer
index is above 95% successful, this imply the final
outcome of this combination is qualified in this part of
application.

5.Conclusions
We found the combination of GA and LiDAR could
reduce the pre-processing tasks for the 3D VR
tremendously. With this automatically handling schema,
one can cover large area with much less time and also
preserve certain quality of accuracy. This improvement
could help in handling large amount of satellite images
for the purpose of hazard assessment and ground
condition verification. Wavelet function in dealing the
image classification and feature extraction have reach the
95% producer index level without human interfering,
which means the fully automatically imagery processing
for LiDAR data with digital camera is a reachable goal
with modern technology. If one could convert the
processed results into GIS ready layer automatically,
near real time geo reference database auto-updated job
could be reached, integration of GPS, GIS and RS (3S)
technology will change the phase of data providing in
regarding to the digital earth. The location base GIS is
another potential client for this technique, so is the
human kind at entire world..
