Abstract
We consider the shape of two point Hermite interpolation on the sphere. A three-parameter family of spherical
rational quartic curves has been derived. We derive the
singularity conditions theoretically and discuss the shape
of the solutions, which is characterized by the presence of
loops and cusps on restricted as well as whole segment. Our
results can be used to develop a practical scheme for spherical Hermite interpolation, which would generate quartic
spherical C 1 Hermite splines.

1 Introduction
As polynomial and rational functions are standard in industrial applications [11, 6], different tools have been developed to represent spherical curves in the last years [4, 7, 12].
Spherical curves have various applications including techniques for motion design in robot kinematic and computer
animation [8, 10]. Rational spherical curves are more useful
specially in CAD/CAM system based on parametric representations of curves. These curves are also used in algorithms for the construction of Pythagorean hodograph
curves [2, 3, 5].
Rational quartics on the hypersphere S 3 in fourdimensional space have been used by Wang and Qin [13]
for solving the C 1 Hermite interpolation problem. The data
(two points with associated ﬁrst derivative vectors) spans a
hyperplane. It is natural to study those solutions which are
contained in this hyperplane, i.e., three-dimensional solutions although other solutions also exist. Recently, using the
generalized stereographic projection [1], J¨
uttler and Wang
[9] have proposed a two-parameter family of spherical rational quartics interpolating C 1 Hermite data on the sphere S 2
in three-dimensional space and obtained the conditions numerically (but not theoretically) which guarantee the curves
without loops (double points) and cusps.

In this paper, we use an elementary calculation to derive a three-parameter family of the spherical rational quartic curves in three-dimensional space. We not only simplify the method of J¨uttler et al. [9] but also provide one
more degree of freedom as well as the generalization of their
scheme. We obtain the singularity conditions theoretically
and discuss the shape of the solutions, which is characterized by the presence of cusps and loops. Next section gives
a background for the Hermite interpolation using spherical
rational quartics with description of method. In Section 3,
we give two useful choices of the three parameters for an
easy generation of a special C 1 interpolation and analyze
its shape on the restricted segment with help of mathematical tools. We generalize our scheme in Section 4 and obtain
singularity conditions on the whole segment for the threeparameter family of general spherical rational curves.

2 Preliminaries
We study the problem of C 1 Hermite interpolation (two
points with associated ﬁrst derivatives) with spherical rational curves by considering a quartic
X(t) =

2p0 p1 − 2p2 p3 , 2p1 p3 + 2p0 p2 , p21 + p22 − p20 − p23
of degree 4 on the unit sphere in 3-dimensional space with
quadratics pi (= pi (t)), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, where r(t) = p20 +
p21 + p22 + p23 . Note the identity
(2p0 p1 − 2p2 p3 )2 + (2p1 p3 + 2p0 p2 )2
+(p21 + p22 − p20 − p23 )2 = r(t)2

in [1, 9]. Given two points Q0 and Q1 on the unit sphere
with associated ﬁrst derivatives (tangent vectors) D0 and
D1 , we ﬁnd a spherical rational curve X(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
such that
X(0) = Q0 , X (0) = D0 , X(1) = Q1 , X (1) = D 1 .

The given data includes not only the tangents, but also
the length of the boundary derivatives, i.e., the parametric
speed at t = 0 and t = 1 which may be important for applications in computer animation or kinematics, where spherical curves correspond to rotations. Here, the interpolation
of a given (angular) velocity distribution can sometimes
be desirable in CAD/CAM applications. In order to simplify the analysis, the points Q0 (= (− sin φ, 0, − cos φ))
and Q1 (= (sin φ, 0, − cos φ)) are assumed to be in the
lower half of the xz-plane. Their bisector in the xz-plane
is assumed to be the z-axis. Then, using the well-known
parametrization of a circle by q = tan φ2 , the C 1 Hermite
boundary data can be represented as

where Z = 0 is ﬁxed in [9]. Thus, after taking the Hermite
data into account, we obtain a three-parameter family of solutions. The three free parameters are the three coordinates
(X, Y, Z) of the inner control point b of the B´ezier curve
(5).

The object of this section is to derive the cusp and loop
conditions for the restricted (not whole) segment X(t), 0 ≤
t ≤ 1 of the form (1). The number of freedom being 3, we
consider the following special cases: p3 (t) = 0 (⇔ a3 =
c3 = Z = 0) and p2 (t) = 0 (⇔ a2 = c2 = Y = 0 ) to
analyze the shapes (cusps and loops) of the quartic curve
segment X(t).
Theorem 3.1. (p3 (t) = 0),
(i) A cusp occurs at (0, 0, 1) if
64q 2 S2 T2 + (1 + q 2 )2 (S2 T1 − S1 T2 )2 = 0,

of degree 2 in B´ezier form for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, where

64q 2 S2 T2 + (1 + q 2 )2 (S2 T1 − S1 T2 )2 > 0. (8)

Now we consider the existence of cusp(s) and loop(s) on the
curve of the form (1).

Let b = (1, X, Y, Z), then X(t) depends on three parameters X, Y, Z since

where Q0 · D0 = Q1 · D 1 = 0. In addition, we assume that neither of the given tangent vectors vanish nor
the two end points are the same, i.e., (T1 , T2 ) = (0, 0),
(S1 , S2 ) = (0, 0), and q = 0. Then, an elementary calculation gives an explicit representation of the family of solutions, depending on three free parameters X, Y and Z. The
solution matching a given set of C 1 Hermite boundary data
have three degrees of freedom. We consider a curve

4 Singularity conditions on whole segments
The object of this section is to derive the necessary cusp
and loop conditions for the whole curve X(t)(−∞ < t <
∞) of the general form (1). We assume T2 (X 2 + Y 2 −
q 2 (1 + Z 2 )) = 2qT1 (1 + q 2 )(Y + XZ). Then, pi (t), 0 ≤
i ≤ 3 have no common zeros. Denote pji (= pji (t)) and

Theorem 4.1. A cusp requires the existence of a real common zero of U (t) and V (t)where if p0 (t) and p3 (t) have a
real common zero, 64q 2 S2 T2 + (1 + q 2 )2 (S2 T1 − S1 T2 )2 =
0 and then, (X, Y ) is given by

= 0,

(16)

from which follows (t, s) = (0, 1). Note Q0 = Q1 to
see there is no loop. Next, p0 (t) = 0 requires p0 (s) = 0,
i.e., p0 (t) must have two distinct zeros in (0, 1). Let t =
1/(1 + m) for m > 0, then, p0 (t) = 0 reduces to
4qS2 m2 − (1 + q 2 )(S2 T1 − S1 T2 )m − 4qT2 = 0, (17)
which must have two distinct positive roots (by Descartes’s
rule of signs) if ﬁrst two inequalities in (8) exist.
Theorem 3.2. (p2 (t) = 0),
(i) A cusp occurs at (0, 0, −1) if
64q 2 S2 T2 + (1 + q 2 )2 (S2 T1 − S1 T2 )2 = 0,
(1 + q 2 )(S2 T1 − S1 T2 ) − 8qS2 ×
(1 + q 2 )(S2 T1 − S1 T2 ) + 8qT2 > 0.

(1 + q 2 )(S1 T2 + S2 T1 )

(18)

Proof. A cusp occurs if X (t)(= (x (t), y (t), z (t))) =
0. Denote the determinants of the coefﬁcient matrices of
(x , y ), (y , z ) and (z , x ) by di , i = 1, 2, 3. Then, a simple calculation shows that
d21 + d22 + d23 = 16(p20 + p23 )(p20 + p21 + p22 + p23 )4 . (22)
Depending on whether p0 (t) and p3 (t) have a real common
zero, we consider the following two cases.
Case 1 For p20 + p23 = 0 (⇔p0 (t) and p3 (t) have no real
common zero). Since at least one of the above coefﬁcient matrices is nonsingular, solve x (t) = 0 and
y (t) = 0 for p1 and p2 to obtain (20). Note z (t) = 0
since x2 (t) + y 2 (t) + z 2 (t) = 1.
Case 2 p20 + p23 = 0 (⇔p0 (t) and p3 (t) have a common
zero). Note p21 + p22 = 0. Then, x (t)(= 2(p21 +
p22 )(p1 p0 − p2 p3 ) = 0 and y (t)(= 2(p21 + p22 )(p2 p0 +
p1 p3 )) = 0 require p0 = p3 = 0. Since p0 (t) and

the zero of p0 into p3 , p0 and p3 to get

where lij (x) = p2i (x) + p2j (x) for i, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, i = j.
First we consider the case when l12 (s)l03 (s) = 0. Solve
(25)(i)-(ii) for p0 (t) and p3 (t) (note that (25)(i)-(ii) are two
circles with respect to (p0 (t), p3 (t)) to obtain

us to show u2 (< 0) = 0, u21 − 4u0 u2 > 0 for (X, Y ) by
(27).
Finally, we consider the case when l03 (s) = 0, then,
(25)(iii) requires l03 (t) = 0 or p0 (t) = a0 (1 − t)2 + 2t(1 −
t) + c0 t2 and p3 (t) = a3 (1 − t)2 + 2t(1 − t)Z + c3 t2 to

where lij (s) for i = 1, j = 2 satisﬁes (25)(iii) and for
i = 0, j = 3 requires l03 (s) = l12 (s) which reduces the
second case to the ﬁrst one. For simplicity of calculation
and presentation, we let t = 1/(1 + m) and s = 1/(1 + n),
where s = t. Multiply the both sides of (26) by l12 (s), and
divide the differences of the left hand sides and the right
hand ones by (m − n) to obtain two equations (linear in m),
the Sylvester’s resultant of which in m can be factored into
a product of quartic r4 (n) and quadratic r2 (n) where

Similarly, solve (25)(i)-(ii) for p0 (s) and p3 (s) to obtain
the same quartic r4 (m) and quadratic r2 (m). Therefore,
a loop occurs if the quadratic r2 (n) has two distinct real
zeros, i.e., u2 = 0, u21 − 4u0 u2 > 0.
Next, we consider the case when l12 (s) = 0, then,
(25)(iii) requires l12 (t) = 0 or p1 (t)(= −a0 q(1 − t)2 +
2t(1 − t)X + c0 qt2 ) and p2 (t)(= a3 q(1 − t)2 + 2t(1 −

c0 Y = −c3 X, a0 Y = −a3 X, Mathematica greatly helps
us to obtain
(X, Y ) =

6 Conclusion
We simpliﬁed and generalized the scheme presented by
J¨uttler et al. in [9] on C 1 Hermite interpolation (two
points with associated ﬁrst derivative vectors) on the sphere
. We obtained a three-parameter family of rational spherical
quartics to solve the problem theoretically and derived the
conditions for loop and cusp on restricted and whole segment.
Our method can be used to develop a practical scheme
for spherical Hermite interpolation, which would generate
quartic spherical C 1 Hermite splines. For each segment of

the spline, the remaining three degrees of freedom have to
be dealt with appropriately based on suitable heuristic techniques or using numerical methods for minimizing a suitable fairness measure. Shape of the solution is very important in both approaches. One extra degree of freedom
provides more ﬂexibility to users for practical applications.
