Abstract
In the paper, a new principal curves design is presented
which is based on a new subdivision scheme. Principal
curves are extensions of principal component analysis and
are smooth curves, which pass through the middle of data
sets. The core of principal curves design is to iteratively
average the current local projections of the data sets which
produce smooth ’middle’ curves. The adaptive principal
curves design is generated in two steps: forming the fold
line by joining up the nodes in order, generating scheduled
smooth curves by iteratively subdividing the fold lines. The
experiments demonstrate the validity and facility of our algorithm.

1. Introduction
Principal curves were originally deﬁned by Hastie and
Stuetzle[1](hereafter HS) to formally capture the notion of
smooth curves passing through the ’middle’ of multidimensional data set. The principal curves can well describe the
pattern features, retain structure information, have nothing to do with thickness of strokes, translation and distortion. The original HS deﬁnition of principal curves is
based on the concept of self-consistency, which means that
each point of the curves is the average of all points that
project there. Principal curves [2-5] are extensions of this
method in which a linear manifold can be used instead of
the line subspace determined by principal component analysis. However, there is clearly a difﬁculty with this in that it
is always possible to fast a ﬁnite training set with no error.
Finding principal curves which can have not only high level
smoothness but also reduced error compared with the initial
fold line is still meaningful and difﬁcult. The goal of this paper is to develop an algorithm for principal curves design,
which is based on subdivision method of computer aided
geometric design. In order to make the principal curves
open out the middle feature of the scattered data sets well

and truly, we present a new subdivision scheme for curves
design and apply it to iteratively reﬁne the fold line.
The paper is divided as follows. Section 2 discusses the
new subdivision method. Section 3 discuses the principal
framework of the algorithm and shows the experiment results. Section 4 is the conclusion.

2. Subdivision Scheme
Subdivision deﬁnes a smooth curve or surface as the
limit of a sequence of successive reﬁnements. Subdivision
method has widely appeared in geometric modelling and
mechanical design [6,7]. In order to generate smooth curve
from initial control polygon through successive reﬁning, the
analyses of the construction of reﬁnements and the convergence of the corresponding subdivision scheme are necessary.
The typical subdivision schemes of curves are of Chaikin
[8] and Dyn [9]. The limit curves generated by the two subdivision methods cannot approximate initial control polygon very well. In the paper we construct a new 4-point approximating subdivision scheme for smooth curves design.
Then act the scheme on the fold line by projection to generate smooth principal curves. The limit curves are of C 2
. The reﬁnements and its convergence analysis of the new
subdivision method will be given in the following subsections.

2.1. reﬁnements for curves
Because the operation of one step acting on a polygon
in Chaikin scheme looks as if cutting corners of the original control polygon and the 4-point interpolatory scheme
of Dyn likes pilling up peaks along the initial polygon, the
4-point approximating subdivision scheme combines the
above two schemes and the limit curve has geometric features of both the schemes i.e. cutting corners and piling up
hills.

. Then the limit curve generated by the
where0 < w < 16

scheme is of C .
These weights are the solutions of a constraint problem
derived from the constraint conditions of C 2 -continuity.
The limit curves generated by the scheme are of of C 2 . The
proof of the theorem is in subsection 2.2. Fig.1 gives the
comparison of the approximating extent of the initial polygon and the limit curves generated by Chaikin’s method,
Dyn’s skill and ours. The results show the limit curve produced by our method is prior to the skills of Chaikin and
Dyn.
The generating function formalism lends itself well to
derive sufﬁcient conditions for subdivision schemes to be
C k . The scheme step can be compactly written in a single
equation

Lemma 5 If S is a subdivision scheme of the form above
and 12 Sk+1 converges uniformly to the zero function for all
initial data P 0 then S ∞ P 0 ∈ C k for any initial control
polygon P 0 .
The smoothness analysis of theorem can be derived from
the above lemmas.

2.2. Convergence analysis
Given S being a subdivision scheme deﬁned by the
rules satisfying (2), the characteristic L-polynomial of this
scheme derived from the method Dyn[10] is
α = [· · ·, 0, 0, −w,

It is obviously that the parameters of α satisfy (5). The
scheme converges uniformly to a continuous limit function
due to

where 0 < w < 16
For our scheme we have

Now we give some results from Dyn[10].
Lemma1 Let S be a subdivision scheme deﬁned by a mask
satisfying (5).Then there exists a subdivision scheme S1
with the property
dP n+1 = S1 P n

(6)

where P n = S n P 0 ,and (dP n )j = 2n (pnj+1 − pnj ).
Lemma2S is a uniformly convergent subdivision scheme,if
and only if 12 S1 converges uniformly to the zero function
for all initial data P 0 .
Lemma3 If S is a uniformly convergent subdivision
scheme,then it determines a unique compactly supported
continuous function S ∞ P 0 .
Lemma 4 Let S be a subdivision scheme with a characteristic L-polynomial
α(z) = (

1+z k
) q(z)

If the subdivision scheme Sk ,corresponding to the Lpolynomial q(z) converges uniformly,then S ∞ P 0 ∈ C k for

The following results can be deduced by analogy,i.e.

Hence all the sufﬁcient conditions are satisﬁed for this
scheme to be C 2 .

3. The Adaptive Principal Curves Design
On the basis of subdivision skill in computer geometry,
the paper puts forward a kind of novel and high efﬁcient
technique to gain principle curves.
The algorithm includes two steps.
Nodes extraction and fold line forming: the algorithm
match the nodes with the average of values of pixels in moving windows ordered on the total or the part of an image.
Then linking the nodes in certain order.

Subdivision the fold line: subdividing the fold line by
(1) and (2) till certain smoothness. Fig.2-ﬁg.4 demonstrate
the results of our algorithm acted on different scattered data
sets.The principal curves design algorithm based on subdivision introduced in the paper is a general tool, which is not
restricted to the three examples discussed here. The quality of the output are controlled only by the initial fold line
and the subdivision method selected. In order to maintain
the favorable character of the initial fold line it is necessary
that assigning each part of the segmented image for a single
direction.

4. Conclusion
We have shown that principal curves can be obtained by
acting subdivision rules on fold lines. Linking the nodes
generated by projection forms the fold lines. The advantage of the principal curves design is that it is simple
and adaptive when we have the initial nodes and the fold
lines.Meanwhile, the subdivision method developed in the
paper is suitable generating better smooth principal curves.
Because of the restriction of the linking relation of the
nodes, it is difﬁcult for extraction the principal curves from

improving the methods in order to ﬁnd principal curves of
complicated image.
