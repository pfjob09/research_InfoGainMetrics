Such methods include isometric mapping (Isomap)[6], locally
linear embedding (LLE)[7], laplacian eigenmaps[8], and local
tangent space alignment (LTSA)[9] etc. While these methods
are defined only on training data, and the issue of how to
map new test data remains difficult. Therefore, they cannot be
applied directly to recognition problems.
Recently, some methods resolve this difficulty by finding a
mapping on the whole data space, rather than on training data;
for instance, locality preserving projections (LPP)[10], [11]
and neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE)[12]. These
methods are designed to preserve data locality or similarity in the embedding space rather than good discrimination
capability. Some manifold learning algorithms explicitly address classification problems, such as marginal Fisher analysis (MFA)[13], and locality sensitive discriminant analysis
(LSDA)[14]. The above methods tend to give undesirable
results if samples in a class form several separate clusters
(i.e., multimodal). To address this shortcoming, Sugiyama
proposed a new dimensionality reduction method called local
Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA)[15], which effectively
combines the ideas of FDA and LPP; that is, LFDA maximizes
the between-class separability and preserves the within-class
local structure at the same time. Thus, LFDA is useful for
dimensionality reduction of multimodal labeled data.
However, LFDA is considered a local discriminant method
for manifold learning, since the discriminative margin in
LFDA is determined by the limited nearby data pairs, while
LDA and MMC explore global information of different classes
in all samples for discrimination. As shown in [16-18], local
discriminant methods(i.e. MFA, LSDA, LFDA) may be optimal for a part of dataset and lose counterpoise for supervised
learning. In some cases, the performance of LFDA may
be much worse than that of LDA and MMC, and fails to
dimensionality reduction and classification.
In order to overcome the unbalanced learning problem in
LFDA for image recognition, we propose a new method, called
local and global marginal discriminant analysis (LGMDA).
This method combines global discriminant measure and local
clustering information together to achieve good discrimination
for better classification. The global discriminant measure enforces separation of overlapping samples from different classes
and local discriminant efforts compact data in the same class.
The proposed method is to eliminate or reduce local structures
with large between-class overlaps via the linear projection.

Abstract—Reducing the dimensionality of data without losing
intrinsic information is an important preprocessing step in image
recognition. Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA) is a
linear projective map that arises by solving the multimodal
problem, which effectively combines the ideas of FDA and
LPP. However, since the limited data pairs are employed to
determine the discriminative ability, such local discriminative
methods usually suffer from the maladjusted learning. To improve the discriminant ability of LFDA, this paper proposed
an improved manifold learning method, called local and global
marginal discriminant analysis (LGMDA), by incorporating the
maximum margin criterion (MMC) for image recognition. As a
result, the proposed method tries to find the submanifold that
best discriminates different classes and preserves the intrinsic
relations of the local neighborhood in the same class according
to prior class information. Experiments on the COIL-20 and
YaleB images databases show the effectiveness of the proposed
LGMDA.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Image recognition is a topic of considerable interest in
pattern recognition and computer vision. Over the past few
years, appearance-based methods have become more and more
popular, and are used to deal with image recognition tasks.
However, in many practical image recognition applications, the
performance of these methods may be degraded when faced
with many features that are not necessary for classification[1],
[2]. An important question in pattern recognition is how to
extract a small number of good features[3], [4].
One common way to overcome or alleviate this problem
is by using subspace learning to reduce the feature dimension, and many such subspace learning algorithms have been
proposed in the literature. Representative subspace learning
algorithms include principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher
discriminant analysis (FDA) and maximum margin criterion
(MMC)[5], which assume that the samples lie on a linear
embedded subspace and aim at preserving the global Euclidean structure of the image space. However, research has
shown that facial images lie on or near a smooth nonlinear
manifold. PCA and FDA for dimensionality reduction, often
fail to discover the intrinsic manifold structure of the image
space[4], [6]. Manifold learning method is a perfect tool for
data mining that discovers the structure of high dimensional
data sets and provides better understanding of data[6], [7].

The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by
experiments on two well-known image databases.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
first present a brief review of dimensionality reduction algorithms, and discuss the limitations of existing algorithms. The
LGMDA method is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 presents
the experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of
LGMDA. Finally, we provide some concluding remarks and
suggestions for future work in Section 5.

C. LGMDA
To improve the discriminant ability of LFDA, we incorporate the idea of iMMC to combine global discriminant
measure and local clustering information together to achieve
good discrimination for image recognition.
At first, we make an assumption that naturally occurring
data may be generated by structured systems with possibly
much fewer degrees of freedom than what the ambient dimension would suggest. Thus, we consider the case when the
data lives on or close to a manifold ℳ of the ambient space.
In order to model the local geometrical structure of ℳ, we
first construct a nearest neighbor graph G. For each data point
x𝑖 , we find its k nearest neighbors and put an edge between x𝑖
and its neighbors. Let 𝑁 (x𝑖 ) = {x1𝑖 , x2𝑖 , . . . , x𝑘𝑖 } be the set of
its k nearest neighbors. Thus, the weight matrix of G can be
defined as the Heat Kernel. However, it is not easy to choose
an appropriate parameter 𝜎 for the Heat Kernel. And also, the
Heat Kernel gives a non-sparse affinity matrix. It would be
computationally advantageous if the affinity matrix is sparse.
A sparse affinity matrix can be obtained by assigning positive
affinity values only to neighboring samples, so we define the
weight matrix of G as follows

II. T HE PROPOSED LGMDA METHOD
A. Typical Behavior of LFDA and MMC
Dimensionality reduction results obtained by the above two
methods are illustrated in Fig. 1 – two-dimensional two-class
data samples are embedded into a one-dimensional space.
For the simple dataset depicted in Fig. 1(a), both LFDA and
MMC nicely separate the samples in different classes from
each other. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), LFDA can overcome
the intrinsic limitation of MMC that learns the projection
direction to nicely separate the labeled samples. However, the
performance of LFDA is much worse than that of MMC as
shown in Fig. 1(c), which may be caused by the discriminative
margin in LFDA is determined by the limited nearby data
pairs, so it may be optimal for a part of dataset and lose
counterpoise for all samples. It implies that either LFDA
or MMC has a particular advantage over the other one that
motivates us to improve the discriminant ability of LFDA.

The nearest neighbor graph G with weight matrix A characterizes the local geometry of the data manifold. However,
this graph fails to discover the discriminant structure in the
data. In order to discover both geometrical and discriminant
structures of the data manifold, we construct two graphs, that
is, within-manifold graph G𝑤 and between-manifold graph
G𝑏 . For each data point x𝑖 , the set 𝑁 (x𝑖 ) can naturally be
split into two subsets: 𝑁𝑏 (x𝑖 ) and 𝑁𝑤 (x𝑖 ). 𝑁𝑏 (x𝑖 ) contains
the neighbors having different class labels, and 𝑁𝑤 (x𝑖 ) contains the neighbors sharing the same label with x𝑖 . Clearly,
𝑁𝑏 (x𝑖 ) ∩ 𝑁𝑤 (x𝑖 ) = ∅ and 𝑁𝑏 (x𝑖 ) ∪ 𝑁𝑤 (x𝑖 ) = 𝑁 (x𝑖 ).
′
Let W𝑙𝑏 be the weight matrix of G𝑏 and W′𝑙𝑊 be the weight
matrix of G𝑤 . We define the following:
{ ′
′
𝐴𝑖,𝑗 (1/𝑛 − 1/𝑛ℓ𝑖 ) 𝑖𝑓 ℓ𝑖 = ℓ𝑗
(4)
W𝑙𝑏,𝑖𝑗 =
1/𝑛
𝑖𝑓 ℓ𝑖 ∕= ℓ𝑗
{ ′
′
𝑖𝑓 ℓ𝑖 = ℓ𝑗
𝐴𝑖,𝑗 /𝑛ℓ𝑖
(5)
W𝑙𝑤,𝑖𝑗 =
0
𝑖𝑓 ℓ𝑖 ∕= ℓ𝑗

B. Motivation
To improve the classification performance of LFDA, the
maximum margin criterion is employed to supply a gap for the
maladjusted marginal learning. Though information of classes
is well considered, MMC has a shortage in the definition of
between-class scatter matrices. The sample mean of total data
and various types are separated as possible. However, owning
to the effect of edge class, some classes may become close to
each other, which results in overlapping of samples in adjacent
classes[18]. So, S𝑏 is redefined as:
′

S𝑏 =

𝑐−1
𝑐
1∑ ∑
𝑝𝑖 𝑝𝑗 Δ2𝑖𝑗 (𝜇𝑖 − 𝜇𝑗 )(𝜇𝑖 − 𝜇𝑗 )𝑇
𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑗=𝑖+1

(1)

When two data share the same class label, it is with high
confidence that they live on a same manifold. Therefore, the
weight value should relatively be large.
Now, the new discriminant objective of LFDA is embodied
as that it preserves the within-manifold scatter between each
sample in 𝑁𝑤 to its k-nearest intra-class neighbors and maximizes the between-manifold scatter between each sample in 𝑁𝑏
to its k-nearest interclass neighbors, which can be formulated
as
∑
′
max ∥y𝑖 − y𝑗 ∥2 W𝑙𝑏,𝑖𝑗

√
(𝜇𝑖 − 𝜇𝑗 )𝑇 (𝜇𝑖 − 𝜇𝑗 ), and all classes are
where Δ𝑖𝑗 =
treated fairly to avoid the leading role of edge classes in eigendecomposition.
Then, the improved maximum margin criterion (iMMC) can
be obtained and rewritten in the following form
′

arg max 𝑡𝑟(V𝑇 (S𝑏 − S𝑤 )V)
V

Based on the above discussion, we will describe our method
in more detail on next subsection.

Let the column vectors v1 , v2 , . . . , v𝑑 be the solutions of

high-dimensional objects into two-dimensional space, and the
comparison results are illustrated in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3(a)-(f) shows that LGMDA and LFDA produce better
results than other methods, and LGMDA performs the best.
The failure of PCA may be due to its unsupervised nature,
and the poor performance of LDA and SLPP is caused by the
multiple submanifolds image data. LFDA presents the almost
comparative performance as LGMDA in that it combines the
ideas of FDA and LPP to solve the multimodal problem,
but the discriminative margin in LFDA is determined by the
limited nearby data pairs, thus produces some overlapped
point. LGMDA cannot only find the sub-manifolds of highdimensional image space, but also enforces separation of
overlapping samples from different classes, and it achieves
the best performance.
B. Image recognition
We test our method and the state-of-the-art methods on
the mentioned two databases. Some processes during the
experiment are marked as follows:
(I) For each image in COIL-20 database, we manually crop
the ear image to size of 32 × 32 pixels. For each image in
YaleB database, the facial area is cropped manually from the
original image and resized to a resolution of 32 × 32 pixels
with 256 gray levels. Thus, each image can be represented by
a m-dimensional vector in image space. We lastly normalize
them to be zero-mean and unit-variance vectors.
(II) We split the data into training set and test set. The
training set is used to learn a lower-dimensional embedding
space using the different methods, and all the testing samples
are projected onto the lower-dimensional embedding space.
Then, a k-nearest neighbor classifier is performed in the
optimal embedding space for classification. In the experiments,
the number of nearest neighbors (k) is taken to be 1. For
those methods need PCA to reduce dimensionality firstly, the
number of principal components is decided by remaining 98%
energy.
The experimental details are discussed as follows:
(1) Experiment on the COIL-20 database: In this experiment, we randomly select i (i= 2, 4, 6, 8) samples of each
individual for training and the others for testing. We repeat
the classification process 20 times by using different splits
and calculate the average recognition rates. Fig. 4 shows the
recognition curves of various methods.
According to Fig. 4, we can obtain the following conclusion.
For all methods, the recognition accuracy increases with the
sample size of the training set. The reason may be that a large
set of training data can sample the underlying distribution
more accurately than a smaller set. In most cases, supervised
methods perform better than unsupervised methods, and the
reason may be that supervised method can make use of
discriminant information in the image space. Our LGMDA
method is the top performer in all the experimental cases,
which indicates that LGMDA is more effective than other
methods in extracting and representing image features for
recognition over the variation of angel.

III. E XPERIMENTS AND D ISCUSSION
In this section, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on two
well-known image databases, and the typical images of two
databases are shown in Fig. 2.
1) COIL-20[19]: Columbia Object Image Library is a
database of gray scale images of 20 objects. The objects
were placed on a motorized turntable against a black
background. The turntable was rotated through 360∘
to vary object pose with a fixed camera. Images of
the objects were taken at pose intervals of 5∘ . This
corresponds to 72 images per object. Here we conduct
experiments on the second set which contains 1, 440 size
normalized images of 20 objects. Each image is resized
to 128 × 128. Despite high dimensionality, the images
in this database are approximately parameterized by one
degree of freedom, e.g. the angle of rotation.
2) YaleB[20]: The YaleB face database contains 16, 128
images of 38 human subjects under 9 poses and 64
illumination conditions. In this experiment, a subset,
which contains 2, 414 near frontal gray-scale images
of 38 individuals with 68 images per individual, is
randomly selected to test the performances of LGMDA
on large database.
A. Embedding of multiple objects
In this section, we use COIL-20 dataset to illustrate the discriminant capability and dimensionality reduction capability
of LGMDA with the several representative dimensionality reduction algorithms, including PCA, FDA, MMC[5], SLPP[11],
and LFDA[15].
In this experiment, we choose five objects out of the 20
objects in COIL-20 dataset. We randomly select 10 samples
of each object for training and the others for embedding

subset, which contains 760 gray-scale images of handwritten
digits with 20 images per individual, is randomly selected to
test the performances of LGMDA on large database. In the
YaleB subset, i (i= 2, 4, 6, 8) images of each individual are
randomly selected for training, while the remaining images are
used for testing. All the results are 20 times averaged by using
different splits. The average recognition results are shown in

LGMDA outperforms other methods, and SLPP, LSDA, LFDA
are better than PCA+FDA and MMC. FDA and MMC discover
only the Euclidean structure, and cannot reveal the underlying
nonlinear manifolds that facial images lie on. Therefore, their
discriminating power is limited. SLPP, LSDA and LFDA are
supervised manifold learning methods and try to discover

C. Discussion
The experiments on the two image databases have revealed
some interesting points.
∙ For all methods, the recognition accuracy increases with
the sample size of the training set. The reason may be
that a large set of training data can sample the underlying
distribution more accurately than a smaller set.
∙ Our LGMDA method is the top performer in all the
experimental cases, which demonstrates that LGMDA
is more effective than other methods in extracting and
representing image features for recognition in two image databases. The good performance of the proposed
method indicates that LGMDA combines global discriminant measure and local clustering information together
to achieve good discrimination for better classification.
The global discriminant measure enforces separation of
overlapping samples from different classes and local
discriminant efforts compact data in the same class.
∙ An effective learning method can achieve good performance when the size of training sample is small. As
expected, the recognition rate of LGMDA is significantly
better than other methods when the size of training
images is small in Figs. 4-5. As shown in Fig. 5, it is
clear that the recognition rates of PCA+LDA and MMC
on YaleB database are significantly degraded than those
on COIL-20 database, which indicates that PCA+FDA
and MMC cannot extract the intrinsic discriminant features for face recognition when the facial images vary
in lighting and pose conditions as well as the image
database becomes large. FDA and MMC discover only
the Euclidean structure, and cannot reveal the underlying
nonlinear manifolds that facial images lie on. Therefore
their discriminating power is limited. However, LGMDA
can extract discriminant features for both discriminating between-class manifolds and preserving within-class
manifold structure, so it achieves more promising results
on COIL-20 and YaleB image databases.

IV. C ONCLUSIONS
As introduced in this paper, either MMC or LFDA has its
distinctive advantage for discriminative subspace learning. To
overcome the intrinsic limitation of LFDA, a new method,
called local and global marginal discriminant analysis method
(LGMDA), is proposed for image recognition. LGMDA combines the maximum margin criterion into the local margin
criterion utilized in LFDA to achieve good discrimination for
better classification. The global discriminant measure in the
maximum margin criterion enforces separation of overlapping
samples from different classes and local discriminant efforts
compact data in the same class. The effectiveness of the
