worthwhile classification of IGPs has been taken up to this
day with specific focus on their construction [5]. Also one
important aspect of IGPs that has failed to attract any kind of
classification is these patterns made of geometric shape. We
have had a good look into the human conclude to represent
star pattern in order to describe the pattern by its extraction
region that they are Islamic Geometric Shapes. Djibril
presented a method is also proposed for indexing and
classifying ISP images on the basis of the extracted features
[10, 11].
This research is a part of an application for analysis
Islamic Geometric Patterns images that can be used as a
practical application in art researches and industries such as
cloth design, architecture and etc. As well as, it can be used
in IGP reconstruction and is useful for Internet picture search
engine tools, too.
Moments and moments-based image invariants have
been used in image recognition extensively [22, 20]. Teague
[19] introduced the concept of Zernike moments to recover
the image from moment invariants based on the theory of
orthogonal polynomials.
Artificial neural network (ANN) has been inspired from
biological neural structure of human brain. Although, ANN
is very simple abstraction of its biological counterpart, but it
has been interested a lot because of its extensive power in
pattern classification and clustering in the resent years [15].
This paper is organized as follow. In the next section,
proposed system and its structure are described. Section 3
surveys pre-processing stage. Section 4 gives detail
description of Zernike moments and feature vector
enrichment in representation stage. In section 5 is devoted to
classification stage and introduces their properties. Section 6
reports the experimental results and finally, the conclusions
are outlined in last section.

Abstract— In this paper, we consider the use of orthogonal
moments for classify Islamic geometric pattern images. To
implement this technique, we use shape based classification.
Zernike moments have been utilized as shape image descriptor.
In classification stage, two different classifiers namely Knearest neighbor rule, feed forward neural network have been
used, which they are traditional nonparametric statistical
classifier. Set of different experiments on binary images of
regular, translated, rotated and scaled Islamic geometric shape
has been done and variety of results has been presented. The
results showed that orthogonal moment invariants are
qualified as features to classify Islamic geometric pattern. The
best result was 96.03% correct recognition demonstrating
Zernike moments and Nearest Neighbor are adequate for
Islamic star pattern recognition.

INTRODUCTION

Many researches in computer science have been done on
Islamic Geometric Patterns in recent years. Generally,
previous studies and research projects in Islamic geometry
can be divided into two main categories. The first groups are
provide algorithms to draw Islamic geometric designs and
second groups are in image processing fields like indexing,
analyzing and reconstructing the images of Islamic
geometric patterns [23,24]. These geometric patterns have
often presented a longstanding historic awe to group theorists
who have endeavoured to present a prudent classification of
these structures [1]. Many attempts that have been made to
classify the Star/Rosette patterns have resulted in a wide
variety of construction groups and classifications. Grunbaum
and Shephard tried to decompose these geometric patterns by
their symmetry groups after obtaining the base region, which
they had used to arrive at the properties of the original
pattern [2]. European group theorists like Dewdney have
proposed a classification based on reflecting lines off to
periodically placed circles [3]. Lee has presented simple
constructions for the common features of IGPs but has failed
to present a benchmark classification theorem [4]. Abbas and
Salman in their landmark thesis on symmetries of Islamic
Geometrical Patterns were of a firm opinion that no

PROPOSED SYSTEM

Fig. 1 shows the structure of proposed system, just like
every classical image processing system [7], the proposed
system is composed of several isolated processing stage. In
pre-processing stages, the operations like noise reduction and
segmentation are done for image enhancement. In
representation stage, labeling then Zernike moments are used
as shape descriptor. In the last stage, extracted features are

any number zero included of internal contours) that delimit
the objects region. Fig. 2 shows labeled image and a
geometric shape is extracted.

B. Feature extraction
Teague [19] has proposed the use of orthogonal moments
to recover the image from moments based on the theory of
orthogonal polynomials, and has introduced Zernike
moments. Zernike moments a set of complex polynomials
{V x, y } which form a complete orthogonal set over the
1, in polar coordinate [21] the form
unit disk of
of the polynomials is:
V r, θ
R
r e
V x, y
(1)
where n is positive integer or zero; m is integers subject
to constraints n-|m| is even, and |m|≤n;
is the
length of the vector from the origin to the pixel (x, y); θ=
arctan(y/x) is the angle between the vector r and x axis in
counter clockwise direction; R
is Radial polynomial
defined as:

PREPROCESSING

The purpose of pre-processing is to create an
intermediate representation of the input data. To extract the
features of the shape we use moments and we have to
eliminate the noise appeared while scanning. The data used
for the experiment was extracted from scan picture of 140
different patterns.
A. Noise Reduction
A nonlinear mean filter using a 3×3 mask has been used
for image noise reduction. This filter has high ability to noise
removal, retains sharp edges and fixes some undesired
disconnections if possible [7].

R

B. Segmentation
In this first stage the image is acquired and preprocessed
to reduce noise and enhance its quality. Then, a color
segmentation algorithm is applied to decompose the image in
homogeneous regions differentiated by color or texture
attributes. The output is again an image but each region
(object) has been properly labeled with an index that
differentiates it from the other regions and from the
background. We proposed to use Union-Find algorithms
[28].

where x2 +y2 ≤1.
The defined features of Zernike moments themselves are
only invariant to rotation. To achieve scale and translation
invariance, the image needs to be normalized first by using
the regular Zernike moments. The translation invariance is
achieved by translating the original image f(x, y) to f(x+ ,
y+ ), where

moment's calculation. Scale invariance is achieved by
enlarging or reducing each shape so that the image's 0th

the algorithm of back propagation. Table1 shows each layer
properties.

For each image, we have a vector of labeled geometric

B. Nearest Neighbor Rule
Nearest neighbor rule is also a conventional
nonparametric statistical classifier. In training stage, it stores
all training samples in a table. Then in testing stage, it
assigns an unknown input pattern to which class has
minimum distance to a training sample of that class.
Different definitions of distance can also be used here Cityblock distance and Maximum distance.

A. Multi Layer Perceptron
Neural Network is a network of non-linear system that
may be characterized according to a particular network
topology. Where, this topology is determined by the
characteristics of the neurons and the learning methodology.
The most popular architecture of Neural Networks used in
shape recognition takes a network with three layers. These
are: Input layer, hidden layer and output layer. The number
of nodes in the input layer differs according to the feature
vector’s dimensionality of the segment image size. Using

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this paper, the conventional classification methods,
nearest neighbor and neural network are used. The output
shows how a star shape is diagnosed from other shapes
properly. In this approach, shapes belong to one of two
classes, star and non-star. A three-layer MLP has been
utilized. In hidden layer log-sigmoid and in output layer
linear transform functions are used respectively. Fig. 6
demonstrates the results of a set of experiments using feature
vector consists of Zernike moments with respect to different
numbers of nodes in the MLP hidden layer. Results show 15
nodes seem to be adequate as the number of hidden layer
nodes. In all experiments, 0.6 and 300 are used as learning
rate and number of training pass respectively. In addition, the
features are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance
before being input to the MLP.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have presented a new proposed system
for the segmentation and classification of Islamic geometric
patterns. Our segmentation algorithm which is based on the
region extraction and our classification algorithm based on
shape recognition provide an exact classification of IGP
images.
In the pre-processing stage, a nonlinear mean filter was
used for noise reduction. In the representation stage, Zernike
moments were used as shape descriptor. These moments are
invariant under image reversal. In classification stage, two
different classifiers namely nearest neighbor rule with three
distance metric, multilayer perceptron are used. KNN is
traditional nonparametric statistical classifier. MLP is a wellknown neural network classifier. Set of different experiments
was done to select proper classifiers parameters (MLP) and
to see effect of number of training samples. In all
experiments, KNN had good results instead of MLP. Finally,
the best result was 96.03% correct classification which
shows orthogonal moments and KNN are adequate for
Islamic geometric shape recognition.
