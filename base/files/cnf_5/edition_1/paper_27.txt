due to the lack of high-dimensional data for feature selection
and classification.
Adoption of texture analysis is the recent trend for
classifying remote sensing images, such as PAN satellite
image [5][6], to compensate the lack of the spectral
information. Although the classification accuracy can be
improved from 10% to 44% after incorporating the texture
measures [7], such approach may not be appropriate for very
high spatial resolution image due to the high variance of
spectral values in the neighborhood pixels. Recently, featurebased representation of images using wavelet transform
potentially offers an attractive solution to this problem. The
process performs a number of feature extraction processes
from the raw image based on the wavelet transform [11]. The
features extracted from the image objects can be represented
by wavelet coefficients in low and high bands. The spatial
relationship between the extracted features and the image
objects add new dimensions in characterizing the objective
contents because the wavelet coefficients convey more
semantic meaning. By organizing these wavelet coefficients
into tree structure, object contents can be represented in
multi-scale at various details which is of particular benefit to
image classification.
Neural network has been used in remote sensing image
classification including multi-spectral and SAR images
[12][13] in the last few decades. It has been proven that the
supervised classification using neural network is superior to
the statistical classification technique [14][15]. Neural
networks for adaptive processing of data structures are of
paramount importance for structural pattern recognition and
classification [16]. The main motivation of adaptive
processing is that the neural networks are able to classify
static information or temporal sequences and to perform
automatic inferring as well as learning [17][18][19]. In
[16][20], the studies proposed supervised neural networks for
classification of data structures which was based on the use
of generalized recursive neurons and the Backpropagation
Through Structure (BPTS) algorithm. Comparing to the
conventional Backpropagation neural network, BPTS is
more reliable because of the well-structured algorithm. In
this study, we investigate the use of the BPTS algorithm to
classify the PAN remote sensing image as well as the
wavelet-based features decomposed from the original PAN
image.

Abstract—Neural network has been increasingly used in
remote sensing image classification in the last few decades.
Nevertheless, an efficient method for high resolution remote
sensing image classification, particularly panchromatic (PAN)
image, is still under investigation. This work presents a neural
network classification method for urban land cover mapping
using the wavelet-based features extracted from a PAN
IKONOS image. A structured-based neural network with
backpropagation through structure (BPTS) algorithm is
conducted for
image
classification.
After
wavelet
decomposition, the object’s contents from the PAN image can
be represented by its wavelet coefficients. The pixels’ spectral
intensity and the derived wavelet coefficients are combined as
attributes for the tree representation in the neural network.
With the designed neural network structure, a total of 2510
pixels of four land cover classes are selected as training data
and 19498 pixels for the same land cover classes are selected
for testing data. All the land cover classes are perfectly
classified (100%) using the selected training data and the
classification rate based on testing data set reaches to 99.68%.
The experimental results reveal that the proposed method
demonstrates a viable solution for classification of high
resolution panchromatic remote sensing data.

INTRODUCTION

Panchromatic (PAN) satellite image is a single band
grayscale remote sensing image which covers the visible and
part of the near-infrared red range of the electromagnetic
spectrum. PAN image has been successfully used in land
surveying and mapping purposes such as terrain modelling
[1]. Recently, several research work have further explored
the usage of PAN satellite image in various applications such
as feature extraction of roads/highways and buildings
[2][3][4], land cover mapping [5][6], urban growth studies
[7], change detection [8], tree crown determination [9] and
vessel detection [10]. PAN satellite image has finer spatial
resolution comparing to the multi-spectral image;
nevertheless, the latter is a superior in image classification
due to the availability of fruitful spectral information.
Generally, multi-spectral image classification approaches
may not directly be appropriate in classifying the PAN image

METHODOLOGY

combined as features for neural network classification. The
features obtained from the spatial domain include a pixel’s
spectral value, mean of all pixels’ intensity in the designed
class, and the standard deviation (STD) corresponding to the
mean. The features extracted from the frequency domain are
a pixel’s wavelet coefficient, mean of all pixels’ wavelet
coefficients in this class, and the STD corresponding to the
mean. Therefore, the tree structure as shown in figure 3
contains three parameters at each node.

A. Wavelet Transform
The discrete wavelet transform is considered and
summarized in figure 1 for feature extraction. It is noticed
that the original image (or previous low-pass results at level j)
can be decomposed into a low-pass band (Lj+1) and a highpass band (Hj+1) through filters at level j+1. By applying a
low-pass filter and a high-pass filter, the low-pass band (Lj+1)
is again decomposed into a low-pass band (LLj+1) and a
high-pass band (LHj+1). The high-pass band (Hj+1) is
decomposed into a low-pass band (HLj+1) and a high-pass
band (HHj+1). Sub-bands LLj+1, HLj+1, and HHj+1
represent the characteristics of the image in the horizon,
vertical, and diagonal views respectively. The local details of
an image, such as edges of objects, are reserved in high
bands. The basic energy of the image is reserved in LLj+1.
We refer to the four sub-bands created at each level of the
decomposition as LLj+1 (Low/Low), LHj+1 (Low/High),
HLj+1 (High/Low), and HHj+1 (High/High). Further
description of wavelet decomposition of the PAN image can
be found in [21].

B. Tree Strucutral Representations
A tree representation of an image decomposed by
wavelet transform is shown in figure 2. At level one (L1), the
original image (the top image) is decomposed into four
bands. The most left one in the line of L1 is the low
frequency band (LL1), and the right three ones are the high
frequency bands (LH1, HL1, and HH1). At level two (L2), the
previous low frequency band is decomposed into another
four bands. The most left one in the line of L2 is the low
frequency band (LL2), and the other three ones are the high
frequency bands (LH2, HL2, and HH2). Obviously, from
figure 2, one can notice that the basic energy and the edges
of object can be observed in low frequency bands and high
frequency bands at each level, respectively.

C. Input for Neural Network
The objective of supervised classification in remote
sensing image is to identify and partition the image pixels to
the feature classes (e.g. building and non-building) in
accordance to the statistics estimated from training samples.
In this study, the spectral and frequency information are

follows: a) the class of building consists of 3568, b) 4787
pixels are tested for the class of road, c) 8634 pixels are
selected for vegetation, and d) 2509 pixels are examined for
water bodies. Table I summarizes the detail of the training
and testing dataset for each land cover class.

sequence. Most structured information presented in the real
world are hardly be represented by simple sequences.
Although many early approaches based on syntactic pattern
recognition were developed to learn structured information,
devising a proper grammar is often a complicated task
because the domain knowledge may be incomplete or
insufficient [18]. On the contrary, the graph representation
varies in the size of input units and can organize data in a
flexible manner. The encoding process (shown in figure 3) is
independent on the classification task without pay attention
to the nodes. Recently, neural networks for processing data
structures have been proposed in [20] and BPTS has been
demonstrated its usefulness in processing data structures. It
extends the time unfolding which is carried out by backpropagation through time in case of sequences. A general
framework of adaptive processing of data structures was
introduced by [18][22][23].

A. Panchromatic IKONOS Image
A PAN IKONOS satellite image with size of 2048 ×
2048 pixels covering the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in is
used in this study (see figure 4). The extent of the image
covers part of the Toronto Pearson international Airport and
includes a number of busiest highways in the GTA (e.g.
highway 401, 427 and 409).The land-use of the area includes
residential areas (small town houses, warehouses), and
factories. The image is a cloud-free image acquired in the
year of 2006. The spatial, spectral, and radiometric
resolutions of the image are 1 m, 0.45-0.90 μm, and 11 bit,
respectively. In this experimental work, the land cover
classification problem comprises of four classes: building,
road, vegetation and water bodies.

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

This section reports the classification performance of the
proposed method. The attributes of all the nodes in the tree
are vectors of 3 inputs consisting of intensity, mean, and
STD as described in Section 2. In this investigation, a single
hidden-layer is adopted for the neural classifier, which has 3
input nodes, and 4 output nodes. The experimental results
with 9 hidden nodes used in the neural network are tabulated
in table 2. It is noticed that the classification rate of the road
class is 98.68% where there are 63 pixels within this class
are misclassified as vegetation. For the rest of the land cover
classes, the classification accuracies reach up to 100%.

B. Training and Testing Samples
There are two parts in the experiments: 1) training for the
neural network, and 2) results testing for performance
assessment. In order to make findings reliable, 2510 samples
are selected randomly as the training data set, among which
621 samples are for building, 297 for road, 1259 for
vegetation, and 333 for water bodies. The training samples

By using neural network for classification, the number of
hidden nodes could obviously affect the result [24].
Therefore, several different numbers of hidden nodes are
investigated in the experiment. The results are shown in table

153

3. Based on the training data set, all classification accuracy
rates are 100% when the number hidden node varies from 5
to 15. With the trained neural network, the testing is carried
out with testing data set. For 7 hidden nodes, the
classification rate is 99.56% and it increases slightly to
99.68% for 9 hidden nodes. For 15 hidden nodes, the
classification rate is 99.48%. The classification results show
that the structure-based neural network is accurate enough
for classifying all the land cover classes in the PAN
IKONOS image with the proposed approach; particularly,
the experimental result yields the best when the number of
hidden nodes is 9.

CONCLUSIONS

A method based on wavelet decomposition is proposed
for panchromatic IKONOS image classification with
adaptive processing of data structures. The classification
parameters include the features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains of the panchromatic image by using
wavelet decomposition. The spectral intensity and the
wavelet features are combined as the input attributes for the
BPTS algorithm. The training data for the neural network
contains 2510 for four different land cover classes and the
classification accuracy up to 100% is reached. With the
trained neural network, the classification rate achieves up to
99.68% with reference to another 19498 pixels as testing
samples. It can be seen that the proposed method using
BPTS and wavelet transform offers a viable solution for high
resolution panchromatic image classification.
