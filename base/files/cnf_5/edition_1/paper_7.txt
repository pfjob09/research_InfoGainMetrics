Interactivity is revolutionary in art history. The most
important element in interactive art is that the audience
participates in the artwork directly and re-creates the
meaning of the artwork. Several questions thus arise. What
does this mean? How does it function and how might it
affect its audience? How can we better understand the
participant experience [2]? The audience creates its own
content; hence, what is the role of the audience in interactive
art? Is their only action to play with the art or to be curious?
In this paper, we are interested in the meaning of their
actions. We look for more accurate methods with which to
learn more about audience action. Due to technological
limitations, interactive art is not yet advanced enough to
allow audiences to create the narrative.

Abstract— The aim of this research is to create a production
model for interactive art in a narrative form. We establish a
conceptual framework for the development of a narrative in
terms of its interactive scenario, graphic design, and technical
design. Based on this framework, we create a prototype of a
“Magic Monkey,” which is interactive art in a narrative form.
We exhibit a prototype of “Magic Monkey” and evaluate the
performance of the interactive narrative.

INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background and motivation
Interactive art is a form of digital installation-based art
that involves the audience in a way that allows the art to
achieve its purpose. Interactive is defined as ‘Inter,’ which
refers to the relationship between the audience and the object,
and ‘activeÿ which means action. In interactive art, works
are presented in half of the unfinished work and the audience
completes the work as half of the originator [1]. The
following table shows the concept of interactive art
compared to previous art forms.

The audience can interact with a character on a screen
that with the character having autonomous role. The
audience watches the character and responds to the real-time
actions of the character. The narrative affects this process.
The narrative brings the flow to the audience, and the flow is
the solution to a question. The audience creates the new
interest about their action in interactive art via the narrative.
Compared with previous interactive art forms, interactive art
in a narrative form provides a “flow” of experience to the
audience and involves the audience in a way that allows the
art to achieve its purpose.

The interaction can be conceived as embodying an
ecological relationship between users and digital characters,
each affecting the way the other behaves and interprets the
world. The relationship is ecological in the sense that
interaction is the result of the interdependency between the
human and the digital system, re-formatting the conventional
aesthetic distinction set up between a beholder and a
representational system [3].

these imports in which somebody wants something badly
and is having difficulty obtaining it, as quoted from “The
tool of screenwriting; A writers guide to the craft and
elements of a screenplay” as written by David Howard and
Edward Mabley. Interactive art in narrative form has these
imports, based on the previous studies on narratives,
specifically, “Writer’s Journey; Mythic Structure for Writers”
by Christopher Vogler.

1.2. Aim of this research
The aim of this research is to create a form of interactive
art entitled “Magic Monkey.” We establish a conceptual
framework for the development of a narrative, and we use
this framework as the basis for the creation of the prototype
of “Magic Monkey,” which is interactive art in narrative
form.

Development
Climax and ending

There is no theoretical approach to interactive art,
especially in narrative form. There have been many studies
of the effectiveness of interactivity [1] or aesthetics of
Interaction [4]. Interactivity discusses the factors of audience
participation [2][5]. These studies focus on the ‘play’ of an
audience for amusement purposes.
Other studies have investigated production of interactive
art. Based on their experience in the creation of interactive
artwork, several researchers have described their frameworks
and prototypes [3][6].
Figure1 Jeffry Shaw, Legible City, 1989

There has been much research into the structures of
interactive storytelling [7][8]. Interactive branch structures
help the audience understand interactive storytelling. In some
of this research, multiple stories are produced by the
audience. The audience choices determine the outcome of
the story in real time.

Many studies deal with a generator who creates a
situation automatically [9][10][11]. These systems make it
possible to produce a narrative based on a generator audience
who chooses the situation. However these studies propose a
prototype only for brief situations due to technological
limitations. Thus, the attempt to solve the limitation on an
author when designing a story leads to the creation of poor
story content.

Development

Climax and ending

We revised framework of narrative, in terms of
interactive narrative.

Interactive storytelling is limited in terms of its basic
structure. Many researchers neglect to value of amusement
which is caused by audience immersion. The choice of a
branch structure is not a factor of the narrative but also a
process through which to choose the narrative.

Table 3. Framework for Interactive art

In summary, the research about interactive art in a
narrative form finds the structure of a narrative that is a chain
reaction of the story.

Interaction design focuses on responding more readily to
the character. Hand movement is input action because hand
movement is usually the first action that occurs when people
encounter media for the first time. In such an event, the
content of the hand movements reacts to light, sound and
character animations. This help the audience enjoy and
become absorbed in the story.
Concept of the Respective Stages
In the introduction stage, the role of the hand as a form of
input is a flashlight. Light in the content moves along with
the flashlight by hand movement. This action is seen from
the viewpoint of the monkey. The Monkey starts to explore
the jungle by the audience.

DESIGN OF “MAGIC MONKEY” INTERACTIVE ART IN
NARRATIVE FORMS

Based on this framework, we created a production design
of interactive art in narrative form entitled “Magic Monkey.”
Magic Monkey desires to be a human being, but is having
difficulty achieving this goal. Magic Monkey appears as an
image on a screen and helps people in distress to escape from
a jungle. By taking on the role of Magic Monkey, the
audience creates a narrative through its own actions.

The second stage is a monkey who is an avatar for the
audience. It flies into the sky. When the audience touches a
butterfly on the screen, the butterfly moves to the audience in
the real world and the monkey in virtual world starts to fly
with the butterfly. This interaction mixing the real and virtual
worlds gives the audience a dreamlike experience by
including the audience in the content. This experience leads
the audience to concentrate on the content until the climax of
the story.

4.1. Scenario Design

In the third stage, the monkey hand touches the water
droplets and makes a sound. This simple interaction design
helps children easily follow the story. When children want
this specific type of play, they can create a melody. The
sound of the droplets has a scale that is determined by height
and motivated by a xylophone playing on glasses of water.
Slow motion makes a slow tempo and fast motion should
make a fast tempo depending on the children’s stories.

Visual graphics for children use bright colors and a
collage style. These types of graphics help children with their
cognitive development. Interactive images are occasionally
associated with problems of data linking and fitting, as the
entire audience cannot be fitted to the monkey character.
These problems lead to the possibility of unnatural
movements or animations. Therefore, animation and graphic
design in this case use a monkey character with jointed arms
and legs.

4.3. Technical Design
The prototype of Magic Monkey consists of gesture
recognition and data mapping for sonification, the use of
non-speech audio to convey information, and character
representation. Fig2. shows the building blocks and
information flow of the system.

4.2. Graphic Design
Design Concept
Children receive new stories in diverse media forms.
Most children are exposed to many types of books and
animations. Previous books are limited to a static form and
depend on the imagination of the children. Animations that
presenting in detail all of the stories in the scenes are limited
to individual children’s stories. Adding interaction is relevant
in such substantial dynamic content. This experience is long
remembered and can increase the effectiveness of learning.

For sonification, a collision of a water drop on the
“Magic Monkey” character generates a sonic event. Because
the height of the water drop upon the collision is used for the
event, data about each drop is stored.
Painting
Based on the modification, “Magic Monkey” was drawn
(Fig. 4). The original images of each part, such as the face,
body, arm, and leg were created separately, and were
combined on the screen by using the calculated coordinates.
The character was drawn again when the coordinates were
changed, thus so allowing the user to feel that the character
imitates his or her moves. Apart from the character, water
drops were created and these fell from the trees continuously.
A very small droplet image was created at the end of a leaf
and was then enlarged. When the size exceeded a threshold,
the droplet began to fall based on the acceleration of gravity.

Figure 2. Schematic diagram of Magic Monkey

Gesture recognition
To recognize the movement of the human body,
Microsoft’s Kinect, which enables users to interact without
touching a game controller, was used. In addition, in order to
utilize the Kinect hardware, a library provided by
PrimSense’s OpenNI was used. A skeleton-tracking
algorithm was implemented in the library

Figure 4. "Magic Monkey" painted with Processing

Sonification
The collision of a water drop on the character creates a
sound. The height of the water drop determines the pitch of
the synthesized sound, and we used the C#7 chord in
demonstration.

Figure 3. Recognized human body via a skeleton recognition algorithm
using Kinect

The system for gesture recognition was implemented
using OpenFrameworks, an open-source C++ toolkit for
multimedia applications. Fig 3. shows the recognized human
body. After obtaining the coordinates of the recognized body
parts, for example the tips of the toes and fingertips, using
the skeleton tracking algorithm, this data is transmitted to a
data mapping system through OSC (Open Sound Control)
which is a protocol for communication between computers,
sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices.

The sonification system which was implemented in this
work handles MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
messages, and therefore supports most sound synthesis
engines. In the demonstration, we used the virtual
instruments of a harp and Tibetan Singing Bowls in Apple’s
Logic as the sound sources.

V.

Data Mapping
It is possible to implement gesture recognition and data
mapping in a single program, but we divided these functions
into two parts due to the computational expense for tracking
users with Kinect, which was too high. The data mapping
system processes the transmitted coordinates. The latter is
used to generate sounds and move the “Magic Monkey”
character on the screen. It was implemented using Processing,
a programming environment based on Java for animation
and interaction. For character representation, the coordinates
should be modified. For example, the recognized leg
skeletons consist of the upper part and the lower part, but
“Magic Monkey” has three leg parts. Moreover, the
proportions of body and the head are different. Thus,
‘cartoonization’ of the body skeleton is necessary.

musical instrument using its entire body. The image on the
screen is a musical instrument and the audience chooses the
best music by their action. Magic Monkey touches water
drops on the leaves of the tree. The water drops make
different sounds. The audience produces its own sounds
through its actions and reactions. At the climax, the man is
deeply moved by Magic Monkey's fantastic music. At the
end of this artwork, the audience chooses whether to be with
Magic Monkey or not.

There is a significant difference between the nonnarrative and narrative groups in terms of how many times
they played waterdrops. The narrative audience played more
times than that of the non-narrative, with a total of 1518 and
884 times respectively. The narrative audience members
scored higher than the non-narrative audience members on
the maximum and the minimum number of times they
played.

The purpose of this evaluation is to help authors who
want to understand interactive art to examine the audience’s
need for narrative. Survey participants were sorted into two
groups, and asked to complete a questionnaire comprising
seven questions. The total number of participants was
twenty-four. Twelve of those did not know the narrative of
Magic Monkey (non-narrative group). The other twelve
already knew the narrative through reading the Magic
Monkey brochure (narrative group). Once they had read the
whole story of Magic Monkey, the non-narrative group
participated in the artwork. To ensure both groups performed
under the same conditions, I gave certain information about
the character of Magic Monkey to the audiences who did not
know the narrative. The audience survey included the

According to this result, audience members who did not
know the narrative considered the character most essential
to the events in the artwork. However, they also thought the
artwork needed the mission and development of the
narrative. Mission and development are therefore necessary
elements in making interactive art in narrative forms.

According to this result, audience members who did not
know the narrative set a premium on the importance of the
character. However they also considered the mission and
development of narrative as factors needing improvement.

Q 5 : Do you wonder what the next mission is?

6-4. Discussion
According to the results, there are significant differences
between the narrative and non-narrative groups in the way
they experience the artwork. Narrative has an effect on
interactive art, especially on the perceived engagement of
audiences. These results show that audiences who know the
narrative of the artwork want to participate in it more than
those who do not know the narrative. Considering narrative
in the creation of the content of the artwork, will help the
author to produce interactive art more effectively.

Interactive art is a new type of media artwork that is made
possible by digital technologies. The more advanced
technologies that are used, the audience can plays various
roles in this type of art. The narrative helps the audience be
interactive while experiencing a meaningful and funny story.
In this study, we produced a framework and created a
production prototype of a form of interactive art in narrative
form. We named this effort “Magic Monkey.” The audience
plays an interactive role, as Magic Monkey. By taking the
role of Magic Monkey, the audience creates the narrative
through its own acting.

On average, the audience members who already knew
the narrative wanted to develop this artwork. The narrative
group scored 3.92 points on the survey, while the nonnarrative group scored 3.08. According to this result,

45

Limitations of this study are that the prototype is not
implemented overall. In terms of the narrative, it is
important that the stream of story affects the audience.
Regarding interactive art as media art, the aesthetics of this
effort is essential an element. Many participants pointed out
the limitations of the implementation while also indicating
that it was a work of outstanding artistic value. High artistic
value is also important. The narrative is the only elements
capable of increasing the flow of the audience. Technical
methods and the physical movement by the audience were
also considered. Greater participation by the audience can
be caused by improving of the accurate reflections of the
audience’s movements.
