Abstract

very important because they produce a right curve with all
suitable designing properties. The newly designed curve
has more efﬁcient in industrial applications. In this paper, we have constructed spur gear tooth model with an
S-shaped transition curve by using T-Bezier function. The
following design techniques are proposed by Baass [1]. A
single ordinary Bezier function of G2 continuity has been
used for the following types of transitions.

In this paper, we construct an S-shaped transition curve
and spur gear tooth model. The attempt has been made
to use the circle to circle technique an S-Shaped transition
curve by using Cubic Trigonometric Bezier function (TBezier, for short) with two shape parameters . The shape
parameters are used to control the S-shaped transition
curves and provide the more ﬂexibility for the interactive
design. We have used two curve segments for the completion of single gear teeth instead of four curve segments.
This model is the introduction of new cost effective, more
economical and computationally easy a more efﬁcient for
CAD and CAE systems than ever before. The smoothness
of the curve is G2 continuity.

Introduction

Gear tooth plays a very signiﬁcant role in Engineering
Science and the manufacturing of automobile, as a fundamental part. The designers as well as manufacturers mostly
used involute and evolute techniques to design a gear tooth.
Now, the researchers have used spiral transcendental functions because they are able to minimize the unwanted friction wear and tear between the mechanical components
[15]. The Clothoid or Cornu spiral has been used in the
gear tooth design for many years [20]. It is unfortunately
inconvenient to incorporate into a CAD and CAE systems
because the Clothoid or Cornu spiral is neither a polynomial nor an algebraic curve. Furthermore, due to the lack
of shape parameter the transcendental functions are relatively inﬂexible.
Computer aided geometric Design (CAGD) has many
fundamental aspects like shape control, curve ﬁtting, data
ﬁtting, font design and curve design. The Curve design is
∗ Corresponding

Most of the aforesaid spiral transitions curves are used in
road or rail design, non-holonomic robot path planning,
and in aesthetic applications. The concept of Case.3 is
applied in this work by using the T-Bezier function with
shape parameters because of its low degree polynomial
curve and suitable in Computer Aided Design application.
This function is written in Bezier form due to its geometric property, numerical property and very easy to use and
implement see for details ([21],[22]).
For many years, spur gear tooth design has been generated by an involute and evolute curve application. The
tracing point method is used to design the involute curve.In
this paper, we can directly produce the design by using the
S-shaped transition curve with T-Bezier function rather using tracing point method.
Many authors have been worked in this spiral transition
curve area like Walton and Meek [2]-[6] have discussed

planar curves of controlled curvature [3] , Planar G2 transition curves composed of cubic Bezier spiral segments [4],
curvature extrema of planar parametric polynomials cubic
curves [5] and a planar cubic Bezier spiral [6]. These transition curves are used for the road or rail designing and
also used as S-shaped transition curve. Sheveleva, et al
[10] have developed algorithms for analysis of meshing
and contact of spiral bevel gears and Kapelevich and McNamara [11] have done some work in direct gear design
for automotive applications. Computer aided design of elliptical gears has been studied by Bair [9] while Xianying.,
et al [12] are more focused on the study of design principle of the LogiX gear tooth proﬁle and the selection of its
inherent basic parameters.
Yahaya., et al [19] have recently developed a method
to design 2D spur gear tooth model by using a ordinary
Bezier like cubic function with an S-shaped transition
curve scheme of Case.3. This function is providing G2
continuity but the authors did not construct the 3D CAD
model. Therefore, there exists very strong possibility that
there proposed model might not be good ﬁt for CAD and
CAE systems. Yahaya., et al [14] have most recently developed a method to design 2D and 3D spur gear tooth model
using the Case.5 by circle to circle where one circle lies inside the other with C-shaped transition curve. The function
used in this designing is Bezier like cubic function with
two shape parameters. This function is providing G2 continuity. After that, the authors have analyzed the model by
using Finite Element analysis (FEA). They selected Cast
Iron 4.5%, ASTM A-48 as gear material and also they ﬁnd
out the applicability of the tooth design. For the completion of single spur gear teeth, the authors used a four curve
segments for this purpose while in this paper two curve
segments are enough.
Rashid., et al [15] have just developed a method to de-

sign a 2D spur gear tooth by using an S-shaped transition
curve by single segment of a PH Quantic Bezier curve.
This function has G2 Hermite like end conditions. Fayyaz.,
et al [16] have recently developed a method to design a 2D
spur gear tooth by using an S-shaped transition curve by
cubic Bezier curve.
In this paper, we consider the Case.3 to design 2D and
3D spur gear tooth model by applying an S-shaped transition curve with circle to circle technique with different
radius by using T-Bezier function. In this model, we developed spur gear model with 14 teeth. For the completion of these teeth we used the 28 segments of circle to circle S-shaped transition curves while recently Yahaya., et al
[14] developed a spur gear model of six teeth. They have
used 24 segments of circle to circle where one circle lies inside the other C-shaped transition curve by using ordinary
Bezier like cubic function. One of the major contribution
of this paper is the use of two curve segments instead of
using four curve segments in the purposed spur gear tooth
design. As a result, the second major contribution is the
introduction of new cost effective, more economical and
computationally a more efﬁcient CAD and CAE systems
than ever before.
The rest of this paper as follow: First, we discussed the
background, notation and conventions in the section (2),
then we written the cubic Trigonometric Bezier function
(T-Bezier function, for short) in the section (3). This work
will be continue on the design of an S-shaped transition
curve by applying Case.3 circle to circle template can be
illustrated by numerical example with curvature plot as
shown in sections (4) and (5) respectively. The spur gear
tooth 2D and 3D design with circle model and gear train
with segmentations will be discussed in the section (6).
Finally, we discussed the conclusion and future work of
this paper in section (7).

Background, Notation and Conventions

3 The Cubic Trigonometric Bezier function

The following notation and conventions are used. Consider A, B are two vectors. They are presented in parametric form as A = (Ax , Ay ) & B = (Bx , By ). The
Euclidean norm or length of vector A is formulated as
A = A2x + A2y . An angle in this paper is measured
in anti clockwise direction. The derivative of the function f is denoted by f . The dot product of two vectors
A and B written as (A.B). A planar parametric curve
is deﬁned by a set of points r(t) = (x(t), y(t)) with
real line interval t. In this paper, we take t ∈ [0, 1].
The cross product of two vectors A and B is deﬁned as
A ∧ B = Ax By − Ay Bx = A B sin θ where θ is
anticlockwise angle and the symbol ‘∧’ is used as cross
product expression described in Juhasz [8]. The tangent
vector of a plane parametric curve is denoted by r (t). If
r (t) = 0, the curvature κ(t) of the curve can be deﬁned
as:
r (t) ∧ r (t)

κ(t) =

A planar cubic Trigonometric Bezier (T-Bezier) function with shape parameters has been developed by Xi-An

Where Bi , i = 0, 1, 2, 3 be the cubic Trigonometric basis
function which can be deﬁne as:
B0 (t) = (1 − sin π2 t)2 (1 − u sin π2 t)
B1 (t) = sin π2 t(1 − sin π2 t)(2 + u(1 − sin π2 t))
B2 (t) = cos π2 t(1 − cos π2 t)(2 + v(1 − cos π2 t))
B3 (t) = (1 − cos π2 t)2 (1 − v cos π2 t)
where Pi , i = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the control points and u, v are
the shape parameters whose controlling the curve shape
as desired. In this paper the value of shape parameter is
−2 < u, v ≤ 1. So the T-Bezier function has a constant of
curvature either positive or negative as shown in Figure.2b.
The Trigonometric polynomials basis functions are
shown in Figure.1a, when the shape parameters are
u = −1.99 & v = 1 (dotted lines), u = −1 & v = −1
(solid lines) and u = 1 & v = −1.99 (dashed lines).

The differentiation of the Equation (1) can be deﬁned as:

spur gear tooth looks quite smooth, pleasant and attractive
to the viewer as compared to [14]. In future, we are interested to continue our research with more dynamic feature
and the acoustic phenomenon test. We will also apply the

In this paper, we have applied the Case.3 in designing a circle to circle an S-shaped transition curve by using T-Bezier function with shape parameters illustrated
by numerical example and also gave the curvature plot
which has a single inﬂection point by graphical as shown
in Figure.2b. We also construct a spur gear tooth design
with an absolutely tooth shape. The important thing in
this paper is that the Case.3 can be applied as an optional
method for designers or manufacturers in designing gears
by T-Bezier function and also this is the new application of
