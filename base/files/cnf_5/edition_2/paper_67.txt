There have been several methods for character font type
recognition. They can be classified into 3 techniques:
Horizontal Projection, Texture Analysis, and Wavelet
Analysis. Lin et al [7] introduced a method that can
identify font types of the characters on the document. It
can also find the most frequently characters and identify
between printed character and handwriting characters.
From this study, most documents have 20% of top
40MFU characters. It detects those characters before
using traditional OCR in order to reduce the
computational time. The method contains three steps.
First step is segmentation that uses projection profile
from text document. Second step is extracting the
features such as the density of black pixels, the
projection profile code, and the modified skeleton
template. That is used to check the matching with the
MFU template. Finally, the results can be obtained from
the previous implementations. Viles and Carlos [8]
analyze the texture characteristics of the document
images. This method extracts global characteristics from
the analysis of textures. It uses the invariant moment
technique to extract the font characteristics from text
images. It can identify the text by applying standard
statistical classifiers. The results of this method can
lower the number of operation. When the textures are
rotated and scaled, it can affect the invariant moments.
The level of classification is average of 95% with noise
over the image. Cruz et al [9] proposed a new optical
font recognition technique by using global texture
analysis to identify and classify font features. The font
recognition works by taking the scanned document as an
image which contains several types of fonts. The
identification does not work on each letter. In this
method, a window analysis is used to find the feature of
the text by using fourth and third order moments. The
new technique does not use local typography in result of
each content independent. In their study, the commonlyused fonts in Spanish are 8 types. Each font has four
styles so that can sum up to totally 32 fonts. Their font
recognition is tested over image with no noise and
Gaussian noise in order to measure the robustness of
their algorithm.

Abstract
A new approach to Thai font type recognition that is
presented in this paper is based on linear interpolation
analysis of the character contour. The algorithm can
perform effectively and classify font type obviously. The
same font type shows high similarity coefficient which is
83.95 but the different font types is below 35.54.

1. Introduction
In the present time, a plenty of documents are printed
and stored in the forms of hard copy and textual formats.
When the information era begun, electronic documents
were created for the reasons that they are easy to keep
and transfer. However, storing a document as an image
file by digitizing or scanning is not a good solution for
this problem. Huge spaces are required to be used and
concerned for collecting the complete important
information. An optimal solution for this problem is to
convert textual images into a proper format by using a
OCR. Thai character recognition has been developed for
many years but the accuracy rate is still a problem for
researchers. Because Thai character is complicated such
as no space between words, some characters exceed
double line, many characters are very similar, and Thai
characters consist of lines and curve. Thai character
recognition area has been growing and it is widely used
in many applications because it is very useful for Thai
people. During the last decade, many researches has
worked on recognition process in standard Thai
characters and the most method is used based on the
segmentation approach [1, 2], statistical approach [3, 4],
and neural network [5, 6]. Those approaches show the
recognition rate over 90%.Today, OCRs have been
developed to satisfy the needs but still lack of some
important information extraction, for examples font type,
font size and font style.

In 2001, Zhu, et al[10] proposed a novel texture analysis
which identifies text as texture. Their method did not use
local feature analysis. The method is tested on 14,000
samples which contains 24 frequently used Chinese fonts
(6 typefaces combined with 4 styles) and 32 frequently
used English fonts(8 typefaces combined with 4 types).
The success recognition rate is average 99.1%. This
method is robust on image with noise.

Step 4 Create linear interpolations from sampling pixels
along the contour of both characters. The results look
like a polygon but still preserve the shape of the
character outline.

In 2005, Abuhaiba [11] introduced a new algorithm for
Arabic optical Font Recognition. His idea is to recognize
fonts of some commonly used Arabic words. When these
fonts are recognized, they can be generalized to lines,
paragraphs, or neighboring non-common words since
these components of a textual material mostly have the
same font. He applied a decision tree to recognize Arabic
fonts. The experiment uses 48 features to learn. These
features consist of horizontal projections, Walsh
coefficients, invariant moments, and geometrical
attributes. The previous Optical Font Recognition
researches focus on Latin fonts or Chinese fonts which
are not similar to that of Thai characters. The proposed
algorithm is different from traditional approaches in that
it is based on the pattern of Thai outline character rather
than evaluating the position of character pixels. The
algorithm is simple and efficient. It can accurately
recognize any font from a set of compared fonts. We
focus only on Thai True Type Font in Microsoft Word.
There are 15 fonts. In fact, there are over two hundred
Thai fonts that can be installed in the machine that
Microsoft Word can use it. Our work can also be applied
to that case.

Step 6 Compare two characters by using Euclidian
distance to classify the pattern of character data.
Euclidian distance can measure the similarity of two data
sets. The lower Euclidian distance value means the
higher similarity of the characters.

2. The Recognition Process

For i : 0 to n

Step 5 Calculate the angle between two vectors along the
contour of each character in closed loop form. The result
represents the pattern of character data.

3. Our proposed algorithm
Input: Let p0 , p1 ….., pn be the vectors of template.
v0 , v1 ……, vn be the vectors of sample.
Output: minimum of Euclidean distance
Algorithm is used to calculate the angles of two vectors
along outline of the character and find minimum
Euclidean distance value to compare two characters.
Step 1 For i = 0 to n

T1i = ିଵ
T2i =ିଵ

Step 2 Find minimum Ei of each character and Ei is the
Euclidian distance.

The proposed process can be divided into two main
processes. First process is about the image processing. It
is used to prepare data set of the characters. The second
process is about recognition process which is the main
process to recognize the font type of Thai characters. The
proposed recognition process can be shown in details as
following.

Experimental Results
Angsana New is commonly used as Thai default font for
printed document.In this study, It is selected to be a
template font for comparing to the other fonts.

Step 1 Capture each character in True Type Font format
(TTF). It is necessary to identify from the machine and
document and keep it into a bitmap file format. The
samples can be captured from printed document.
Step 2 Detect contour of each character by applying edge
detection algorithm and determine the index of the pixels
on the character contour. The index number begins from
0 to n until the closed loop of character reaches.

Step 3 Sample the pixels from the contour points of the
template character and sample in the same amount (for
30, 40, 50, 75 or 100 points).

Figure 3 The comparing graph of Thai
characters contour is between 200 to 400 pixels.
The experiment (Figure 2 and 3) restricted on different
10 font type and font size at 12 pts (100x100 pixels). The
proposed algorithm can recognize the character with the
template character and can classify matched font data.
The accuracy depends on the amount of sampling pixels.
It is noticed here that appropriate amount is in the range
of 30-50 points. The proposed algorithm can
discriminate the resulting data compared to other
amounts. However, the Euclidian distance does not
obviously distinguish the similarity. The similarity
coefficient can be calculated by

Figure 4 the relation between similarity
coefficient and sampling amount
The Figure 4 shows the relationship between similarity
coefficient and sampling amount. When comparing the
similarity coefficient between template font and other
fonts, the suitable sampling should be 30 points. At these
sampling points, the result shows the highest gap
between the similarity coefficient of template font and
the highest similarity coefficient of other fonts. Using 30
sampling points means least computational time when
comparing to 40 and 50 sampling points. This proposed
algorithm is applied also for some Thai characters that
are very similar for example  and  show the similarity
coefficient is 45.21,  Â¨³ £ shows the similarity
coefficient is 42.85 and

 and £ shows the Euclidian

distance is 68.55. They all are tested under the condition
the same font and the same size. From observation, the
similarities of some Thai characters are affected by the
Euclidian distance however the algorithm can still
classify the font type of the Thai character. Therefore the
Euclidian distance can be applied to classify font type of
Thai characters effectively.

4. Discussion
From figure 3, we notice that the gap in the range from
30 – 50 points is wide so we consider this range from our
recognition process. From our experiment, the amounts
of sampling point can affect the efficiency of recognition
process.

5. Conclusion
In this proposed algorithm, Thai character recognition
can be done between each pair of contour lines along on
the contour of Thai character in closed loop form. In fact,
the sizes of the Thai characters are small and some of
them are very alike. The algorithm is simple and
effective. It can classify font type obviously and the
same font types show high similarity coefficients which
is 83.95% of similarity. The result shows the correctness
of recognition is 100%. The amount of sampling points
affect to computational time for recognition process. Our
proposed algorithm is the constant process that can be
applied in the real-time applications for future work.
