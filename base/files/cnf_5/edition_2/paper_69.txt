peak traffic pressure in a specific airspace or some queuing
fixes. Traditionally, this information provides by tables or
histograms on a detailed level and is used to generate
information on trends and global patterns. This manner
ignores hierarchical and multi-dimensional features that alert
information potentially has and leads users can not know the
traffic situation inextenso. Visualization allows for the
analysis of large dynamic data sets that textual presentation
via tables. Visualization relies on the visual system of users
to quickly transfer large amounts of information. It moves
the burden of reasoning partially to the visual system, freeing
other parts of the cognitive system for higher-level tasks.
This can lead to immediate insight in complex phenomena
that would be hard to grasp. Also visualization can provide
context to ATFM partners in accordance with current
dynamic traffic situation and make good decision
collaboratively.
The visualization community has studied how to present
large dynamic data in different manner. Treemap [1] is an
effective method to visualize large amounts of hierarchically
data. Treemaps have been adopted to visualize various kinds
of data successfully, such as the content of file system [1,2],
stock market data, process control data, and source code of
large programs. However, treemaps are still rarely used for
visualizing air traffic information. One reason is that the
ATFM system is not mature and conscious to use more
complex information visualization techniques. Meanwhile,
treemaps are less effective for presenting aggregate
information, compare to simple graphics such as histogram.
Also the air traffic controllers are less familiar with treemaps.
In this paper we present a generalized treemap algorithm
that aims to enhance alert information visualization for
ATFM operations. We propose extensions to treemap
algorithm such that treemaps can be created and updated in
accordance with Air Traffic Control (ATC) manners and
airspace construction in China. The treemap considers
multiple and heterogeneous air traffic data source, also the
display layouts allow for quickly understanding aggregate

Abstract—The alert information play very important role in
Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM), and is often presented
using simple graphics such as histogram or table. These
familiar visualizations are effective for providing overview to
some extent, but the details related to hierarchy are often
neglected. In this paper we present a generalized treemap
algorithm that aims to enhance alert information visualization
for ATFM operations. We propose extensions to treemap
algorithm such that treemaps can be created and updated in
accordance with Air Traffic Control (ATC) manners and
airspace construction in China.

INTRODUCTION

The Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) is
responsible for providing safety and efficiency of the
aircrafts’ operation in airspace. It can strategically and
tactically estimate the air traffic system planed and actual
utilization; ensure smooth operations; avoid controller
workload above desired levels, and ensure a fair treatment of
airspace users in their access to capacity. Nowadays,
Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) is embedded in the
ATFM operational concept as an important element that will
improve efficiency and punctuality. As the name implies,
CDM is about partners working together and making
decisions based on more accurate and higher quality
information that has the exact same meaning for every
partner involved. In CDM, partners may make conflicting
decisions as the result lack of information or the receipt of
information that has diverged meaning to different partners.
Addressing these shortcomings individually will bring
improvements but one can talk about CDM only when the
whole complex set of issues is addressed in its totality and
sufficient support data items.
Alert information plays very important role in CDM. It
can help partners to know the potential conflicts and high

information and simultaneously provide access to
information on a detailed level. Algorithms presented in this
paper have been implemented in GPL Qt environment and
can be run on commercially available system.
In section 2 we describe the ATFM alert data model used,
and propose a DOM structure to meet the visualization needs
of high dynamic alert information. Next, we present an
algorithm to visualize the alert information using squarified
treemaps. Results are presented in section 3, followed by
conclusions and acknowledgements.

ATFM ALERT DATA MODEL

The treemap algorithm will retrieve information from the
dynamic DOM tree in different level that air traffic controller
concerned.

In ATFM, the alert information is closed related to the
topological construction of airspace, which is the alert may
occurred on specific airspace via sectors, airways or fixes. In
China, the Air Traffic Management Bureau (ATMB)
specified airspace into different control areas such as Flight
Information Region (FIR), upper control area, Terminal
Maneuver Area (TMA) and tower control area according to
ICAO specifications. Simultaneously, the alert information is
the function of time span which is alert occurred in a specific
time span. Also there is relationship between alert
information and airspace capacity which is defined by
airspace evaluation [3]. So we can define the alert
information as bellow function.
alert f ( Airspace, Timespan, Capacity )
(1)
In practice, the alert information aggregation for ATFM
is a complex process. It depends on flight plan and
surveillance information. These information come from
different network such as AFTN, SITA, ARNIC and SSR net.
In the same time they are high-dynamic since they are
updated timely. We assume the airspace capacity has been
defined with a reasonable constant number. Considering that
treemaps visualize hierarchical data, the alert information
need to be presented in a tree. Hence we adopt Document
Object Model (DOM) based on XML to present the alert
information tree. This is done by selecting a sequence of
attributes and grouping the items accordingly. Each attribute
corresponds with a level in the DOM tree. Figure 1 shows
our designs in XML Schema Definition (XSD).

VISUALIZE ALERT INFORMATION USING SQUARIFIED
TREEMAPS

Treemap represent hierarchical data sets via recursive
subdivision. Generally, rectangle is used as standard shape to
represent information user cared. Each rectangle is
subdivided into smaller rectangles and these rectangles have
fixed small margin to emphasize the hierarchical structure by
nesting, or for the placement of labels. Considering the FIR
and control sectors hierarchical topology, we choose an
alternative treemap called squarified layout treemap
algorithm [4]. Here rectangles are initialized or added one by
one to a strip along the longest edge in the root rectangle.
According to airspace layout in Air Traffic Control (ATC),
we use constant size to express a quantitative attribute of
sector items and adaptive slice size to adjust attribute of
special alert information such as airway, fix etc.
A simple example is shown in Figure 3. The root node is
airspace to be monitored. Interior nodes are sectors, airway
and fixes. The count number of flight will fly over these
nodes in a specific time span is mapped to the tree.

algorithm to get our desired visualization results. Specifically,
suppose that A(p) is the node’s set of a row or column to be
displayed, worst(A(p), w) is the highest aspect ratio of a list
of rectangle, and w is the short edge of the rectangle to be
sliced, then we can define a layout schema as bellow:
x choose a child node;
x if (worst(A(p), w) >= worst(A(p)+new child node,
w) then push the node into A(p) and choose next
node to enter the further iteration;
x Otherwise, display each node in A(p), empty the
A(p), and enter the further iteration of other A(p).

Here the worst function can be defined as:

worst ( A( p ), w)

max (max(w 2 r / s 2 , s 2 /( w 2 r )))

r A ( p )

Let a list of areas of A(p) be given and s is the total sum
of them.
Applying this algorithm to the data set shown in figure 3,
we can construct ATFM alert information visualization
accordingly.

RESULTS

Figure 4. Alert information visualization of sectors.

We have developed a experimental system for the
visualization of ATFM information, in which we have
embedded our DOM information integration and extensions
of the squarified treemaps algorithms. The system offers a
number of options to influence the resulting visualization.
For example, per level the attribute to be used, the layout
algorithm, possibly extra specifications, drawing to links, etc,
can be specified. Typically, the display results are not always
easy to tune visualizations such that they meet the demands.
We therefore have made different choice for different types
of users which can visualize different detail of ATFM alert
situation such as time span, altitude, airspace, sectors, airway,
fixes and so on.

on airway C1 simultaneously.

alert information integration to meet the high dynamic data
source, and we also extend the squarified treemaps algorithm
to meet the characteristics of ATFM. The experimental
visual system shows that our schema can display the ATFM
alert information in different detail dynamically. The
adaptive slice algorithm can satisfy user desired display
results.
