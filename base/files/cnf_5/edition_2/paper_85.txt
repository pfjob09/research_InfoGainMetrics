Abstract

are produced from industrial activities and in urban areas
by automobiles, cooking and vegetation fires. Aerosols
are categorized by their mode of size. There are three
size modes, which is the nuclei mode for particles less
than 0.04ȝm in diameter, the accumulation mode for
particles between 0.04ȝm and 0.5ȝm in diameter, and the
coarse mode for particles larger than 1.0ȝm in diameter.
In determining the impact of aerosol particles on human
health, the size of these particles is considered to be the
primary 3 determining factor. Ultra fine particles, which
are less than 1.0ȝm in diameter have a high potential to
penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract causing
inflammation and irritation [3]. While particulate matter
that less than 10.0ȝm in diameter acts to increase the
number of respiratory diseases, pulmonary diseases and
cardio vascular diseases.
About three-quarters of particle pollution in the
desert comes from dust. It can be characterized by
periodical outbreaks of dust storms that transport large
amounts of desert dust in the troposphere, resulting in
enhanced optical thickness that is correlated with the
particles larger than 1.0ȝm in diameter. Dust aerosols
have a significant direct impact on the Earth’s radiation
budget, by attenuating the outgoing long wave (LW)
radiation and reducing the solar flux available to heat the
surface. However, there is considerable uncertainty over
the ‘‘direct impact’’ of aerosols due to their spatial and
temporal heterogeneity [4].
Dust aerosols reflect
sunlight back into space, and are known to influence
cloud formation and precipitation.
The work presented in this paper indicated the
feasibility of Fieldspec HH for AOT measurements in
Makkah, Mina and Arafah region. AOT versus PM10
values was plotted to find a linear relationship between
these two parameters. Finally, AOT and PM10 maps
were generated using Kriging interpolation technique for
data obtained from the ground monitoring stations.

This paper presents a transmittance measurements
technique collected by using FieldSpec HandHeld
(Fieldspec HH) spectroradiometer to derive the aerosol
optical thickness (AOT) in the atmosphere at 550nm to
improve the particulate matters of less than 10 micron
(PM10) concentrations mapping. The concentrations of
PM10 at selected locations were measured
simultaneously with the atmospheric transmittance
measurements using DustTrak Aerosol Monitor 8520
and their locations were determined by using a Global
Positioning System (GPS). AOT and PM10 maps were
then generated using Kriging interpolation technique for
estimating aerosol values to be associated with their
distribution patterns. Regression graph were plotted and
value of linear correlation coefficient
(R2) were
determined to see on the accuracies of the data collected
in term of linear relationship between AOT and PM10
values, where the value of R2=1 represent the
theoretically perfect fit. This study proved that AOT
measurements can be determined by using Fieldspec
HH. The results produced in this study showed a strong
linear relationship between AOT and PM10 values over
Makkah, Mina and Arafah.
Keywords: AOT, PM10 and interpolation

1. Introduction
The aerosol optical depth or optical thickness (Ĳ) is
the degree to which aerosols prevent the transmission of
light [1]. Aerosols are solid particles and remain
suspended in the atmosphere at various sizes from 10-3
mm to 103 mm [2]. All liquid or solid particles in the air
that are not consisting of water are called aerosol. They
were originated from natural and man-made sources.
Natural aerosol contains coarse dust particles,
widespread fine aerosol from volcano, oceanic and
continental sources. While man-made aerosol particles

2. Study area and data acquisition
The selected study area was an urban-desert area of
Makkah, Mina and Arafah over Saudi Arabia which
located within latitudes 21.30o N to 21.48 o N and
longitudes 39.73o E to 40.03o E (Figure 1). All ground
data was collected between 9.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. on
19th January 2009. This period of time can be described
as off peak season which is not in Hajj season.

Where ߬ሺߣሻ is the normal atmospheric optical thickness
(AOT) in certain wavelength and ߠ଴ represent the zenith

AOT values were obtained after performing the
following calculations:

1) First, the total solar irradiance was measured by
attach the Remote Cosine Receptor (RCR) to bare
head of Fieldspec HH and mount the RCR on a
tripod perpendicular to the direction of the Sun,
which integrates the lights flux from all directions
that would be intercepted by planer surface.
Irradiance data collected with a RCR in units of
W/m2/nm.
2) Second, we measure diffuse irradiance. The RCR
panel was shaded from direct sunlight using a disk
of black painted cardboard mounted on a stick.
3) Third, the value for direct solar irradiance, ‫ܫ‬ௗ can be
calculated by subtracting the diffuse irradiance from
the unshaded global measurement (to obtain the
direct horizontal component), divides the direct
horizontal by the cosine of the solar zenith angle to
compute the direct normal component.
4) Fourth, we computed the extraterrestrial sun
irradiance for Julian day values corresponding to the
wavelengths of the spectra measured by the
FieldSpec HH.
Approximation for the
extraterrestrial sun irradiance for Julian day, Es
given by [6] as in figure 2 is given by the following
expression:

‫ܧ‬ఖഊ is solar exterrestrial irradiance at wavelength, Ȝ
(550nm = 1.86E+03 W/m2/μm).

Many studies have been carried out to retrieve AOT
values. For this purpose, Fieldspec HH was used to
measure the transmittance values at the ground surface.
The transmittance is related to the AOT according to
Angstrom expression. So we retrieved the AOT value
from these measurements. Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law
atmospheric measurement is applied here. In most cases,
it is evaluated for the wavelength 550nm. The ozone
contribution to the optical thickness usually is small at
550nm and climatology /geographic average can be
taken. This leaves the aerosol contribution as the most
important component which varies strongly in space and
time. In the absence of atmosphere, the transmittance of
solar radiant energy to the ground would be 100%.
However, because of absorption and scattering, not all
the radiant energy reaches the ground. The amount that
does, relative to that for no atmosphere, is called
transmittance. The AOT values were derived from the
measured transmittance. Atmospheric transmittance at

5) The AOT, ߬ሺߣሻ was calculated using the expression
given by the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law from the
direct atmospheric transmittance at wavelength of
550nm by dividing the direct solar irradiance
computed in step 3 by the extraterrestrial sun
irradiance values calculated in the fourth step. This
was done by first exporting the FieldSpec HH
spectrum to a text file, importing the text file into a
program like microsoft Excel and then performing
the calculations in Excel. Then the AOT values were
computed using Equation (1).

Figure 3: A linear correlation between AOT and
3
PM10 (μg/m ) values

To find the correlation between AOT and PM10, a
graph of linear relationship between generated AOT was
correlated against PM10 ground based measurements
retrieved using dusttrak meter 8520. Several studies also
found this linear relationship between AOT and PM10 in
their study [7, 8].
Finally, AOT and PM10 maps were generated using
Kriging interpolation technique for estimating aerosol
values to be associated with PM10 distribution patterns
using PCI Geomatica version 10.1.3 digital image
processing software. Interpolation can be described as
procedure of predicting the value of attribute at
unsampled site from measurements made at location
within the same area or region. Interpolation is necessary
when the ground truth data do not cover the domain of
interest completely. Kriging interpolation fulfils the aims
of finding better ways to estimate interpolation weights
and of providing information about errors. Most
interpolation techniques give similar results when data
are sparse [9]. Other researchers [10, 11] also applied the
interpolation technique in their studies for air quality
mapping.

4. Results and discussions
A total of 25 sampling measurements were collected
around Makkah, Mina and Arafah. The relationship
between AOT and PM10 were tested using least squares
simple linear regression method. It seemed that the AOT
values among the sampling sites increased as PM10
increased. The AOT data reveal a good relationship with
PM10 measurements where the R2 value is exceeding
0.8. The respective scatter plots, AOT and PM10
interpolation maps are presented in Figure 3, Figure 4
and Figure 5.

Makkah, Mina and Arafah in μg/m3
In this study, three observations area were resulted.
Arafah area was recorded the lowest aerosol distribution
both from the AOT and PM10 measurement. This is
maybe because it is located in non-urban area. Mina area
can be classified as moderate and Makkah used to obtain
the highest aerosol and PM10 measurement due to
urbanization and etc.

Conclusion
In this study, Fieldspec HandHeld spectroradiometer
has shown a good capability in determining AOT
measurements over Makkah, Mina and Arafah area. This
is proved with a good correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.802)
between calculated AOT and measured PM10 values.
This study also indicates that the interpolated AOT and
PM10 map can be used to discern air quality categories
such as good, moderate and unhealthy to a relatively
high degree of confidence.
