thematic maps such as those depicting land cover as it
provides a map-like representation of the Earth’s surface
that is spatially continuous and highly consisted, as well
as available at a range of spatial and temporal scales.
Thematic mapping from remotely sensed data is typically
based on an image classification [1]. Remote sensing is
the main source of space information. Land cover
classification is one of the most widely used applications
of remote sensing. Since the launch of the first satellites
in the early 1970s, great effort has been devoted to
developing and improving the methodology to define
land cover classes [2]. Land cover is a fundamental
variable that impacts on and links many parts of the
human and physical environments [1]. This is important
for it provides useful information for planning the area.
A basic problem for any country or region in
economic planning, environmental studies, or resource
management is accurate, current information. The need
for basic surface characteristic information, such as land
use and land cover, is critical to both scientific analysis
and decision-making activities. Without accurate
information, scientists cannot complete valid studies and
decision-makers often fail to make decisions or make
incorrect decisions [3]. The availability of remote
sensing data applicable for global, regional and local
environment monitoring has greatly increased over
recent years [4]. Land cover is a fundamental parameter
describing the Earth’s surface. With sufficient
calibration, a land cover map can be used to identify
spatial patterns of physical quantities such as carbon
storage or vegetation cover as well as more abstract
phenomena such as land use. Accurate information on
land cover is required for both scientific research (eg,
climate change modeling, flood prediction) and
management (eg, city planning, disaster mitigation) [5].
Land cover mapping at coarse spatial resolution
provides key environmental information needed for
scientific analyses, resource management and policy
development at regional, continental and global levels
[6]. Land cover is a fundamental variable that impacts on
and links many parts of the human and physical
environments. This is important for it provides useful

Abstract
This paper present an economical analysis of using a
digital camera imagery data to classify land use/cover in
the Prai Industrial area, Penang, located in Peninsular
Malaysia. The data were captured using a digital camera,
Kodak DC 290 from a small light aircraft at 8000 feet
altitude. This overcomes the problem of difficulty in
obtaining cloud-free satellite images especially in the
equatorial region where experience showed that just two
or three cloud-free scenes per year could be obtained.
The use of digital camera as a sensor to capture digital
images is cheaper and economical compared to the use of
other airborne sensor. The images consisted of the three
visible bands-red, green and blue. Three supervised
classifications techniques (maximum likelihood, minimum
distance-to-mean and parallelepiped) were performed to
the digital image. The training sites were established
using polygons within each scene and four land cover
classes were assigned to each classifier. The relative
performance of the techniques was evaluated. The
accuracy of the classified images was validated using a
reference data set. The results produced high degree of
accuracy. Finally, geometric correction was performed to
the digital image using the nearest neighborhood method
with second order polynomial to produce geocoded map.
The final results showed that the digital camera can be
used as a tool for providing useful data for land cover
classification. The classified images provided useful
information for planning and development of a small area
of coverage.

1. Introduction
The production of the thematic maps, such as those
depicting land cover, using an image classification is one
of the most common applications of remote sensing [1].
There has been a growing interest in the use of remotesensing systems for a regular monitoring of the earth ’s
surface. Remote sensing is an attractive source of the

information for planning the area. The production of the
thematic maps, such as those depicting land cover, using
an image classification is one of the most common
applications of remote sensing [1]. Many researchers
used this technique to achieve this aim [7, 8, 9]. Remote
sensing is believed to be a good technique in collecting
information and making fast decision for planning and
management [10]. Diverse data sources have been used,
such as Landsat-TM[11] and Advanced Very High
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) [12].
The study areas were located in the equatorial region
where the sky is often covered by clouds. Therefore
satellite remote sensing, especially for sensing in the
visible and infrared regions is difficult. This situation can
be even more difficult if the goal is to relate satellite data
with corresponding ground data for analyzing a
phenomenon that changes rapidly with time, such as
those related to water quality, air quality and sea surface
temperature measurements. Our objective was to develop
a protocol to overcome such problems by using an
airborne technique. The advantages of an airborne
technique include i) flights can be scheduled for the
desired time and location, and ii) the aircraft can be
flown below cloud cover and acquire high spatial
resolution images. However airborne remote sensing
techniques are not widely used in environmental
applications as they are associated with high operational
costs. In this study, we reduced the costs by using a
conventional digital camera and hiring a light aircraft.
Digital cameras have been used in many researchers in
remote sensing application [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. A
Canon Camera EOS 1D Mark II 8 MPixel digital camera
was used for traffic monitoring [20]. Others researcher
also used a Kodak DCS460c in their study of vegetation
analysis and small area mapping respectively [18, 19]. A
Nikon Coolpix 885, CP885 was used for water quality
measurements in Galway Bay [21]. Digital cameras have
been used in many researchers in remote sensing
application [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
In this study, digital images were acquired from a
digital camera for land cover mapping. Supervised
classification methods were applied to the digital images.
Maximum Likelihood classifier was found to produce
the best accuracy in this study. Many researchers choose
the Maximum Likelihood method in their studies [2, 22,
23, 24, 25)]. The monitoring task can be accomplished
by supervised classification techniques, which have been
proven to be effective categorization tools ([26]. The
accuracy assessment of the classified images also has
been done in this study. Supervised classification of
remote sensing images has been widely used as a
powerful means to extract various kinds of information
concerning the earth environment. The objective of
supervised classification in remote sensing is to identify
and partition the pixels comprising the noisy image of an
area according to its class, with the parameters in the
model for pixel values estimated from training samples
[27]. The accuracy of the classification map was based

on the confusion or error matrix, Kappa statistic and
overall accuracy.

2. Study Area
The study area was the Prai river estuary, Penang,
Malaysia, located within latitudes 5o 22’ N to 5o 24’N
and longitudes 100o 21’E to 100o 23’E (Figure 1). The
images were captured from the altitude of 4400 ft on 1st
September 2003. The study areas are shown in Figure 1.
The study area was situated in the northwest of
peninsular Malaysia. A digital camera, Kodak DC 290
(Figure 2) was used to capture digital images from a
light aircraft, Cessna 172Q, at 8000ft of altitude. The
digital images were captured during the flight between 9
a.m. to 11 p.m. on 1st September 2003. In general, the
industrial areas are planned for a mixed type
development covering heavy, light and medium
industrial activities.

Kodak is without question one of the dominant
companies in the field of photography. While the bulk of
their enormous business is built upon conventional filmbased photography, they clearly recognize that the future
lies with digital [28]. In this study, red–green–blue
(RGB) digital outputs from a digital camera, a Kodak
DC 290, were used to estimate water quality parameters
(Figure 2). The front of the Kodak DC290 holds the 3x
optical zoom lens, autofocus sensor, flash, self-timer
light, optical viewfinder, light and flash sensors and a
nice, thick hand grip (Figure 2). The Kodak DC 290 is a
2.3-mega pixels digital camera and storage digital
images in JPEG and uncompressed TIFF file formats.

green and blue).
The technical specification for the Kodak DC 290 is
shown in Table 1. Its sensor is capable of acquiring data
in multispectral mode (3-bands: red, green and blue).
There are many types of digital cameras available in the
market. Any person could possess the camera either for
personal use, for producing reports or for research and
other purposes. The use of digital camera is preferable
since digital images could be stored on-board and easy to
operate. Digital cameras are manufactured with different
sensor sizes and resolutions. Sensor size is defined by
width and height of sensor array in millimeter or inches.
On the other hand, sensor resolution is defined by
number of horizontal pixel multiplied by number of
vertical pixel. A digital camera could be categorized as
(1) low resolution if the number of pixels is less than
500, 000; (2) medium resolution between 500, 000 to 1.5
million and (3) high resolution if number of pixel is
beyond 1.5 million. The cost of the digital camera
depends on the resolution. Normally, digital camera of
low resolution is much cheaper compared to digital
camera of medium and high resolution [29]. Kodak DC
290 is categorized as a high-resolution digital camera
[29]. Recently, the number of pixels of amateur digital
cameras is amazingly increased by modern
semiconductor and digital technology. Nevertheless, the
highest pixel of amateur digital camera was 0.8 Mega
pixels in 1996 and the highest pixel was 5.24 Mega
pixels in 2001. It is expected that high-resolution
amateur digital camera will become a useful tool in
various photogrammetric fields [14].

4. Data Analysis And Results
All image-processing tasks were carried out using
PCI Geomatica version 10.1 digital image processing
software at the School Of Physics, Universiti Sains
Malaysia (USM). The satellite image was then
geometrically corrected by second order polynomial
equation using the nearest neighbor method. Figure 3
shows the raw satellite image. Overall, RMS errors of
less than 0.5 pixels were achieved for geometric
correction in this study [32, 33, 34].
The digital images were separated into three bands
(red, green and blue) for multispectral analysis. The
images analysis involved three basic steps in supervised
classification: the training stage, the classification stage
and the output stage. Supervised classification
techniques were performed to the digital images
(Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Distance-to-Mean,
and Parallelepiped). Accuracy assessment was carried
out for the classified map. A total of 120 samples were
chosen randomly for the accuracy assessment in this
study. Many methods of accuracy assessment have been
discussed in remote sensing literatures. Three measures
of accuracy were tested in this study, namely overall
accuracy, error matrix and Kappa coefficient. In thematic
mapping from remotely sensed data, the term accuracy is
used typically to express the degree of ‘correctness’ of a
map or classification [1]. Figure 4 shows the flow chart
for data processing of the images.

The most widely promoted and used accuracy
measure, however, may be derived from a confusion or
543

error matrix. The confusion matrix is currently at the
core of the accuracy assessment literature [1]. The Kappa
statistic is a statistical method of assessing accuracy that
takes into account the chance of random agreement. This
statistic has been used by many researchers in their
studies [10, 35]. Producer and user accuracy are two
accuracies for individual classes. The producer accuracy
is a measure of the omission error and indicates the
percentage of pixels of a given land cover type that are
correctly classified. The user accuracy is a measure of
the commission errors and indicates the probability that a
pixel classified into a given class actually represents that
class on the ground [2]. Alternatively, producer’s
accuracy indicates how well training set pixels are
classified, user accuracy indicates the probability that a
classified pixel actually represents that category in
reality and overall accuracy is the total number of
correctly classified pixels divided by the total number of
reference pixels [8]. Training sites were selected within
each scene and four land cover classes were assigned to
each classifier. The relative performance of the
techniques was evaluated.
A total of 28 sample-training sites were selected
in this study. The digital image was classified into 7
classes, namely Grass, Tree, Land, Building, Urban, Tar
and Black Materials. Kappa coefficient and overall
accuracy results of the three measures of accuracy are
shown in Table 2. The overall accuracy is expressed as a
percentage of the test-pixels successfully assigned to the
correct classes.

The land cover mapping at local scales requires
careful planning of all the data processing and analysis
steps. This analysis has demonstrated the potential of a
spatial approach in studying the land cover mapping. The
most significant finding in this analysis is that the
possibility of using digital camera imagery for land cover
mapping. The highest accuracy classified map was
produced by the maximum likelihood in this study by
comparing the classification results of the three
supervised classification methods. The result indicates
that the use of digital camera imagery for land cover
544

mapping is possible. This study showed that the normal
digital camera can give an alternative way to provide
useful data for land cover mapping.
