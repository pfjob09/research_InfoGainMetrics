Abstract—The aim of this experiment was to determine which
cybersickness symptoms are associated with simulated motion,
by comparing responses to the Simulated Sickness
Questionnaire (SSQ) between a control and experimental
condition. Using non-parametric statistical tests, we found that
general discomfort, fatigue, headache, eyestrain, difficulty in
focusing eyes, increased sweating, nausea, difficulty in
concentrating, stomach awareness and blurred vision were
significantly higher in a high simulated motion task compared
with a low simulated task. The implications for preventing
cybersickness in virtual environments are discussed.

conditions. The symptoms associated with computergenerated environments are similar to those experienced
when exposed to real movement, such as that felt when on a
rocking boat, where there is visual and vestibular
stimulation. In computer-generated VREs, there is no
vestibular stimulation. The collective set of symptoms
associated with the perception of motion when no physical
motion exists is known as cybersickness [2] or Visually
Induced Motion Sickness [1].
A standard questionnaire, the Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire (SSQ) [5], has been developed to determine
whether users of VREs experience cybersickness symptoms.
Using the SSQ, previous studies have shown that exposure to
simulated motion in a VRE produces mild to severe
cybersickness symptoms in between approximately 50 to
80% of participants [2]. Other studies have attempted to
relate characteristic changes in the physiology of
cybersickness with user responses on the SSQ, finding strong
correlations between some self-report and physiological
measures [2]. Since physiological measures are usually
invasive and time-consuming, the results of Kim [2] indicate
that the SSQ alone may be sufficient to determine whether a
user is suffering cybersickness, since the SSQ uses a
relatively straightforward scoring approach [5]. Quantifying
simulator sickness symptoms should be a functional measure
of the severity of the symptoms an individual experiences
and reports [5].
One weakness in both the Kim [2] and the Kennedy [5]
studies is the absence of a baseline against which variance
in responses on the 16 symptom variables of the SSQ can be
attributed to simulated motion, as opposed to (say) just
being inside a VRE. The identification of a baseline against
which symptoms can be evaluated under different types of
simulated motion is both valuable and necessary if (a) the
self-report measures can properly be associated with
simulated motion, and (b) useful for further understanding
the theoretical underpinnings of simulated motion sickness,
especially given the high correlation between physiological
and self-report measures.
A crucial feature of an experimental design is a control
condition against which an experimental condition can be
evaluated. We propose to measure changes in simulator
sickness severity scores between a control and an

INTRODUCTION

Virtual reality environments (VREs) provide innovative
tools for research, professional training and recreational
pursuits. VREs are expected to be widely deployed in
coming years, as cost barriers to entry are reduced. However,
in an era of legislated duty of care, and potential liabilities to
employees, patients, students and consumers, VREs must be
demonstrated to have safe operating limits. In particular,
previous research on motion sickness symptoms arising in
response to the use of virtual environments [1][2][3] has
created health and safety concerns. Many of these symptoms
are associated with perceived motion in a VRE, even when
there is no physical motion of the subject who experiences
these sensations. While there are competing theoretical
explanations of why these cybersickness symptoms occur,
our purpose in conducting research on these symptoms is to
determine which symptoms can be attributed to being in a
VRE versus being in a VRE with simulated motion.
Unfortunately, a lot of research into cybersickness – even
with quite sophisticated experimental designs – has lacked
the rigor of a control condition to ensure that variance
associated with simulated motion can be correctly attributed
to a cause.
Previous research has found that a twenty minute
exposure to VREs can increase cybersickness symptoms in
over 60% of participants [4]. Sharples [3] investigated
virtual reality induced symptoms and effects and reported
60 to 70% of participants described increases in pre- and
post-virtual reality exposure on a range of display

experimental condition. While there are a number of
potential control conditions, we have chosen to evaluate
self-report responses between immersion in a VRE with low
simulated motion compared to a high simulated motion
condition. Thus, we assert that we can partition the variance
due to being in a VRE alone, versus a VRE + simulated
motion. Other psychological conditions – such as anxiety –
have been shown to significantly increase when simulated
motion increases [7].
In this study, we report the results of an experiment using
the SSQ, to determine the effects of simulated motion on
self-reports of cybersickness. Since all of the 16 measures in
the SSQ have previously been associated with cybersickness,
we predict that there will be significant increases in all
cybersickness symptoms between the control and
experimental conditions.

C. Virtual Environments
Two virtual reality immersive environments were
shown to the participants. The control condition consisted of
gentle flight over snow covered gently rolling hills (Fig. 1).
The experimental condition involved a virtual rollercoaster
ride that travelled along winding, ascending and descending
tracks and through rickety tunnels (Fig. 2).
Each immersive environment condition entailed a two
minute continuous circuit which was played three times to
give a six minute experience. The camera speed was
constant at 20 metres per second in both the control and
experimental conditions.
The apparatus comprised of a curved front projection
160° canvas screen (6.2m x 1.7m), three SEOS Cathode Ray
Tube Projectors, Nuvision Stereo Shutter Goggles.

METHOD

A. Participants
Twenty eight (10 female, 18 male) participants ranging in
age from 18 – 30 years old participated in the experiment.
All participants were student volunteers from Macquarie
University. All were healthy, as determined by a Health
Questionnaire and had normal or corrected to normal vision.
Participants were naïve to virtual immersive environments.
Only participants who had no illnesses were accepted.
Prior to the experiment a package was emailed to the
student containing the Macquarie University Ethics
Committee approved consent form, a health questionnaire
and a comprehensive letter informing them not to eat or
drink anything two hours prior to the experiment and not to
consume illicit drugs or caffeine for 12 hours prior to the
experiment.
The consent form detailed the specific purpose of the
experiment was to investigate motion sickness and explained
their rights to discontinue the experiment at any time. All
participants were fluent in spoken and written English as
determined by their enrolment in a degree program. No
participant had been exposed to the virtual reality
environment prior to the experimental session. The study
complied with the Macquarie University Ethics Committee
Approval.
Written informed consent was obtained prior to the
experiment.

B. Experimental Protocol
Participants were tested individually in a repeated
measures design, where the participants acted as their own
control. Prior experience remained constant over the entire
experiment thereby maximizing sensitivity to the
independent variable, since all participants were naïve to
being exposed to the experimental virtual environments.
Participants were seated in a chair placed centrally in front
of the screen and instructed that they would be shown two
six minute virtual reality environments and reminded that
they could discontinue the experiment at any time during the
course of the session. The experimenter verbally asked the

DISCUSSION

The results of this experiment indicate that self-report
of 10/16 symptoms previously associated with
cybersickness in a VRE significantly increase when
simulated motion is increased, while 6/16 do not
significantly increase. Since previous uncontrolled studies
[2][5] had indicated that all 16 symptoms were associated
with cybersickness, these results significantly enhance our
aspect of perceived motion (eyestrain, difficulty focusing
eyes, blurred vision), perceived nausea (nausea, stomach
awareness, discomfort, fatigue) and cognitive (headache,
difficulty concentrating). However, symptoms associated
with gastric activity (salivation, burping) and vestibular
activation (vertigo, dizziness) were absent. These results
indicate that vection [8] rather than vestibular activation
might be mediated through a cognitive route to generate the
nausea symptoms. These results also accord with sensory
conflict theory, since no actual vestibular activation is
reported, and yet participants still feel nauseous [9].
Further research is required to determine the exact
relationships between these groups of variables, and/or their
internal (factor) structure. Ultimately, a computational that
predicts the levels of nausea symptoms given a set of input
conditions (cognitive, perceptual) should be developed to
better understand the dynamics of cybersickness arising
from simulated motion.

The results of the responses to the SSQ for post
immersion in both the experimental and control conditions
were analysed using the parametric matched samples t-test,
and the non-parametric Wilcoxon Matched Pair Signed
Rank Test. A non-parametric test was chosen since no
assumptions were made about the normality of the
distribution of the sample data, to confirm the results
established by the parametric t-test. For all symptoms, there
was complete agreement about the significance of results
found.
The results for the Matched Samples t-test can be
viewed in Table 1 and the Wilcoxon Matched Pair Signed
Rank Test can be found in Table 2. Significant increases
between the control and the experimental conditions were
revealed for General Discomfort, Fatigue, Headache,
Eyestrain, Difficulty in Focusing Eyes, Increased Sweating,
Nausea, Difficulty in Concentrating, Stomach Awareness
and Blurred Vision. No significant increases were observed
for increased salivation, dizziness (eyes open or closed),
vertigo, burping or fullness of head.
