control points which we called crisp control points. This
means that its membership function are left and right
continuous in closed bounded interval at each of ƒÆ-value.
We use this set of fuzzy control points in order to
construct the model of various fuzzy curve and fuzzy
surface such as fuzzy Bezier and fuzzy B-spline. For
their smoothness we use the concept which introduced in
[3] rather then utilize fuzzy kriging method [ 9,10,11].

Abstract
Fuzzy geometric modeling provides a useful tool to
introduce uncertainty into mathematical spline model. In
this paper a new concept of a geometric modeling is
presented, based on the theory of fuzzy numbers. By the
notion of fuzzy number we introduce fuzzy control point
for fuzzy curve and fuzzy surface model for CAGD. We
study the properties concerning approximation of fuzzy
control points by means of fuzzy Bezier, fuzzy B-spline
and fuzzy NURBS..

2. FUZZY SET THEORY
Fuzzy set theory was first introduced by L.A. Zadeh in
1965 [14]. In this section we discuss some fuzzy
concepts which is very useful in the context of fuzzy
modeling of uncertainty.
Let U is a space of fuzzy A.. The membership grade
of an element x in A is denoted by the function P A ( x), P A
maps all elements of U into the set A with values in the
continuous interval 0 to 1, P A : U o [0,1]

Let A ¬ç U . A fuzzy set A is defined by

1. INTRODUCTION
The issue uncertainty in curve and surface design are
quite major problem in CAGD [1]. In geometric
modeling, control points are display the major rule in the
process and produce a smooth curve and surface for
design.
By using fuzzy set theory [2,14], we define a fuzzy
control points through fuzzy number. The problem
uncertain shape of curve and surface can be designed by
using <left, crisp, right> fuzzy control points. By
definition of fuzzy geometrical spline model, the
problems of uncertain curve and surface design will be
solved. See [1].
We provide a set of points in 2D or 3D space to
produce a certain type of curve and surface in Computer
Aided Geometrical Design or Geometric Modeling and it
often occurs that points approximation are not sets of real
number but ranges of qualitative. These set of points are
given incomplete knowledge that is characterized
whether or not that set of points really belong to their
domain of definition. These points we consider as fuzzy
control points which accompany with their degree of
truth which take the value from 0 to 1. See [5,6,7,8].
In this paper we discuss basic concept of fuzzy
geometric modeling using fuzzy set theory [14]. The
basic ideal or method of constructing fuzzy geometric
curve and fuzzy surface from a set of fuzzy control points
are introduced. This fuzzy geometric model consistent
and maintain the underlying their crisp smoothness. This
technique, all uncertainty parameter in the form of fuzzy
number which means that each of crisp control points are
consist of right fuzzy control points and left fuzzy control
points. It has a certain degree of belonging to original

A fuzzy set A is called a fuzzy number if the

following condition are satisfied
(i) There exist x ¬è R , such that P A ( x) 1

(ii) For any D ¬è (0,1] the set {x : P A ( x) t D} is a closed
interval denoted by  A~D , A, A~D ! .
Then, fuzzy number is actually fuzzy set defined on the
set of real numbers which characterized by mean of
membership function. It represents information ‚Äúabout‚Äù
or ‚Äúaround‚Äù such number which has a unique modal crisp
value, convex, left-right continuous, increasing and
decreasing.

The mains objective in fuzzy geometric modeling is to
produced a smooth fuzzy curves and fuzzy surface. In
order to produce a solution about uncertainty in fuzzy
form, Weidon [12], fuzzy data describing a three
dimensional entity, order pair (x, y) and all of uncertainty
is in the altitude , z , component. Through this types of
control points, curve and surface is interpolated and
demonstrated the idea by developing two- and threedimensional surfaces from fuzzy data for cubic splines
and digital terrain models generated from triangulation.
The method of construction curve and surface
presented in [3,11,13] was a first approach to a fuzzy
system for the design of curve and surfaces in the
context of CAGD.
By providing a set of points and used fuzzy
rule, and algorithm of all design method that interact
between the procedure and user. By the use fuzzy
number and Takagi-Sugeno technique in fuzzy control to
design curve and surface [5].

The support of fuzzy set is a crisp set defined as

Support ( A )

{x ¬è X : P A ( x ) ! 0}

Which results in a crisp set containing all member of
A that are non-zero.

THE EXTENSION PRINCIPLE

The extension principle introduced by L.A. Zadeh in
1975 is one the most important concept of fuzzy set
theory, which provided the basic framework to extend
crisp mathematic (such as crisp control points ) concept
in to the fuzzy system.
Fuzzy function is a mapping of points in fuzzy set A
in to (on to) a fuzzy set B. Fore more detail see [2,4,5].
Fuzzy set with higher dimensionality the
membership functions are not constrained to being of
just one variable when a fuzzy set has a dimensional
higher then 1, it is called fuzzy relations.

CONCLUSION

By fuzzy control point as introduced in [1], various
forms of spline being discussed. We purposed the
definition of fuzzy Bezier spline, fuzzy B-spline and
Non-Uniform Rational Fuzzy B-spline spline or fuzzy
NURBS by mean of fuzzy number defined on the real
line. We also discuss and show the result of fuzzy spline
model approximation through numerical examples.
