vegetation surfaces to impervious surfaces, like asphalt,
concrete, tars, etc. Usually, urban area has higher thermal
conductivity and radiation heat budget. Therefore, urban
area may experience higher LST if the conversion of
rural area to urban area drastically. This acceleration has
spurred concerns about LULC recently [3, 4] in driving
losses in biological diversity, water and air quality, and
terrestrial ecosystem productivity and adaptation.
Land cover, represent for the medium between
earths’s surface and subsurface, which is the sources for
all the material and energy movements [5]. Therefore,
land use change, due to the human anthropogenesis
activities in bringing to change, and these changes should
be in careful consideration, in order to preserve the
environment. In order to improve the understanding of
the effect for land changes on environment, a lot of
research done regarding the consequences of land use
change and the causes on the earth [6].
LST is an important factor in regional, local and
global climate studies, because it determines the humanenvironment interaction. Besides, LST is an important
factor controlling the chemical, physical and biological
processes of the earth system [7]. Usually there are two
methods available to measure LST. Traditionally, LST
can be measured direct from the ground truth. But this
method only restricted to the small coverage area and
need lot of time consuming. While, nowadays with
different and variable of satellite images available, the
retrieval of LST direct from satellite image become more
famous. Indeed, the coverage area wider and less time
consuming as compared with the ground truth
measurement. But, after the retrieved of LST, the value
of LST needs to validate with ground truth measurement
data. Furthermore, the validated data only restricted to
perform at flat, large and homogeneous coverage area to
avoid the uncertainty due to heterogeneity [8].

Abstract
Land surface temperature (LST) have been widely used
for environmental studies and urban heat island (UHI),
using satellite derived images. LST retrieval from
satellite images has many advantages for research as
compared with in-situ measurement of air temperatures.
For example, it will help to reduce the time consuming,
more coverage of the study area with the high spatial
resolution, etc. The objective of our study is to retrieve
the LST over Penang Island and compare the trend and
average value of LST within different types of (land use
or land cover) LULC changes in single satellite image.
LST was retrieved by ATCOR3_T using PCI Geomatica
10.1 image processing software. The supervised
classification was chosen to classified LULC changes
over Penang Island. From the result obtained from
different classification method, maximum likelihood
classification showed the most accurate result compared
with minimum distance-to-mean and parallelepiped
methods. The urban areas with high density resulted
shown the highest LST between different LULC changes.
These changes in LULC yield the significant difference
in LST between urban and rural area. Therefore, LST
proved to be a good and effective tool to predict the
impact of LST to different LULC. Besides, the
relationship between LST and NDVI also been
investigated for different LULC changes in this study.
The strong negative and positive correlation was
observed between LST and NDVI for different LULC
changes.

1. Introduction
The abrupt climate change around cities or urban
area become more significant and obvious nowadays due
to changes in LULC changes and anthropogenic
activities done by human [1,2] For example, LST in
urban area is higher as compared with rural area. All
these occurred since the alteration and modification of

2. Study area
The study area is the Penang Island, Malaysia,
located within latitudes 5o 12’ N to 5o 30’ N and
longitudes 100o 09’ E to 100o 26’ E. The map of the
study area is shown in Figure 1. The satellite image was

each scene, all the seven bands in Landsat 5 TM were
used in the multispectral classification analysis using the
classifiers mentioned earlier. To improve the accuracy
assessment between classified area and training side, at
least 20 points at the study were identify regarding the
classes, before undergo the supervised classification.
Secondly, land surface temperature (LST)
retrieved using ATCOR3_T, in PCI Geomatica version
10.1 digital image processing software. ATCOR3_T
considered the elevation data when generate the thermal
surface map. Therefore, it needs to compare the satellite
image with other satellite image, which having the digital
elevation data. In this study, the satellite image compare
with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) image.
SRTM satellite image was downloaded from the global
land cover facility. Besides, ATCOR3_T also has the
function for atmospheric correction for input layer with
the specific visibility parameter [9]. The input layer only
available for thermal band and it is band 6 in Landsat
image.
Thirdly, NDVI was calculated as the ratio
between measured reflectance in the red band (R) and
near infrared (NIR) based on following formula [10]:

acquired on 8 February 2007. The satellite track in path
and row is 128/56. Penang Island is located in equatorial
region and enjoy a warm equatorial weather whole the
year. Therefore, it is impossible to get the 100 % cloud
free satellite image over Penang Island. But, the satellite
image chosen is less than 10% of cloud coverage over
the study area.

NDVI = (ρ (band 4)-ρ (band 3))/ (ρ (band 4) +ρ(band 3))
(1)
where, ρ are the surface reflectance for band 3 and band
4 respectively.
In this study, NDVI was used to examine the
relationship between LST and vegetation greenness
(NDVI). Before calculate NDVI value from the satellite
image, the simple atmospheric correction, called darkest
pixel technique was performed in this study [11]. It is
based on 2 assumptions:
(1) The atmospheric path radiance can consider as the
darkest water pixel of the satellite image due to the total
light absorption and the radiation light recorded by the
corresponding pixel.
(2) Secondly, the atmospheric path radiance assumed
that it is uniform all over the image. For each band, the
pixel was chosen as the darkest pixel from the lowest
values over water over the selected wavelength. The
radiation of the darkest water pixel (assumed to represent
the atmosphere) is subtracted from the whole image.

3. Methodology
All image-processing tasks carried out using
PCI Geomatica version 10.1 digital image processing
software. Firstly, the study area was classified to 7
classes: forest, grassland, urban with high density, urban
with low density, barren land, water and cloud using
supervised classification. Using supervised classification,
3 methods tested for the study area, include maximum
likelihood method, minimum distance-to-mean and
parallelepiped methods. The classified map generated
based on the highest overall accuracy and Kappa
coefficient among all the methods of classifications. The
points assessed were 200 random points for this study
and the same vector layers of points was applied to all of
classified method in these study area. A total of 100
training sample areas were selected in this analysis. For

The generated classified image using maximum
likelihood classifier for the image showed in figure 2.
Table 1 show the accuracy statistics and overall kappa
statistics of Landsat image, which have been classified
using methods mentioned. From the result obtained,
maximum likelihood classifier gives the best result
regarding the highest overall classification accuracy and
Kappa coefficient.

After the retrieval of LST using ATCOR3_T,
the map generated using different colour coded range
(Figure 3). Since the land of Penang Island is interested
in this study, the sea or water area masked out and it is
null, indicate by black colour. From table 2, among the
different LULC changes, urban area with high density
exhibited with the highest average LST (43.71°C),
followed by barren land (43.04°C) and urban area with
low density (38.01°C). The lowest LST observed in
forest area (29.30°C) and second is grassland (35.02°C).

The relationship between land surface
temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation
index (NDVI) was investigated for each land cover type.
Table 3 shows the linear regression correlation
coefficients between these two elements. The highest
positive correlation coefficient was found in forest
(0.7885) and grassland (0.7181). The strong, positive
correlation between LST and NDVI indicates that the
higher the land surface temperature, the higher the
biomasses of land cover. The highest negative
correlation coefficient was found in urban area with high
density (0.7263), urban area with low density (0.6137)
and barren land (0.5088). This implies that the higher the
land surface temperature, the lower the biomasses of land
cover within all these 3 land covers. Figure 4 shows the
map of NDVI, which was computed from the formula.

Conclusions
The study on LST based on classification on different
LULC changes on Landsat image indicates that it could
provide useful and efficient remotely sensed data to
retrieve LST for the study area. Maximum likelihood
classification method gives the most accurate result, with
94.0 % of overall accuracy and 0.905 of Kappa
coefficient. The established linear correlation between
LST and NDVI over the land in Penang Island showed
that both of these parameters having the strong
correlation based on different land cover. From classified
of LULC changes, urban area with high density gives the
highest value of average LST, 43.71°C. For further
study, the retrieved LST may use to detect the urban
expansion through the multitemporal satellite image.
