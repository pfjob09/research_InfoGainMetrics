Abstract

work that we have done along this line with the
conference participants. I will briefly review related
work in this field and present our eye tracking studies
and their follow-up studies (e.g., [5, 6, 7, 8]). The main
focus of this talk will be on how eye tracking can be used
to get useful information and how the information can be
used to inform the design of graph visualizations.

A picture is worth a thousand words. To take
advantage of powerful human vision, we generate
visualizations for people to view and to understand the
underlying data. However, these a thousand words do
not necessarily tell the truth about the data. A good
visualization can make the data understanding process
effective, while a bad visualization may hinder the
process, even convey misleading information. To
produce effective visualizations, it is important for us to
have a good understanding of how people actually
perceive and process the visual information. People view
visualizations using their eyes, and tracking their eye
movements can be a useful method for this purpose. In
this talk, I will present a series eye tracking studies on
how people read graphs. These studies demonstrate that:
1) eye tracking is an effective method for gaining insights
into how people read graphs, and 2) how obtained
insights from eye tracking can be used to inform the
design of visualizations.

2. Biography
Dr. Weidong Huang is a researcher at CSIRO,
Australia. He received his PhD degree from the
University of Sydney. His research interests are in
human-centered computing in general, and HCI, human
factors and visual perception and cognition in particular.
He has published a number of papers in these areas.

1. Introduction
It is well known that representing non-visual data in
a visual format can be beneficial for users to make sense
of them. Among other benefits, proper visualizations can
turn memory-demanding cognitive tasks into more
efficient simple perceptional operations and may serve as
external memory reducing task demand on the limited
human working memory [9].
To generate effective visualizations, it is important
for us to have a good understanding of how people
actually execute various visual queries. In particular,
graph data are often visualized into node-link diagrams.
Although a number of drawing rules, or aesthetics, have
been proposed and proved to be useful for generation of
effective graph drawings, our knowledge of how people
read graphs is still relatively limited. In addition, people
read graphs using their eyes. Tracking their eye
movements may help us to gain useful insights into their
graph reading behaviors.
The method of eye tracking has been used in
research on graph visualization for various purposes
(e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]). In this talk, I will share and discuss the
