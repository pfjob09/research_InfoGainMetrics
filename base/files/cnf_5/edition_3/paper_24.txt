Abstract

focusing on G 2 transition. Walton and Meek in [13]
considered planar G 2 quintic transition between two
circles. In [12], authors used a pair of cubic spiral for
five cases of G 2 transition curves identified in [2].
Habib and Sakai [13] extend the analysis and achieve
more degrees of freedom and flexibility for easy use in
practical application. In recent work the number of
degree of freedom in cubic and PH quintic spiral has
been increased to seven [11], [14]. These additional
freedoms are used for shape control of transition curves.
The quartic Bezier spiral was introduced in [1], this
paper also discussed about G 2 transition between two
separated circles. The purpose of this paper is to report
the results on the used of quartic Bezier spiral as G 3
transition curve. The used of G 3 continuity in design the
transition curves can be found in route horizontal
geometry designs and many others applications e.g.
trajectories of mobile robots.
One of the main problems in the design of route
horizontal geometry is to join two straight lines with a
curve. In the past, using a circular arc simply solved the
problem of joining two straight lines on railway or
highway alignment. However, with increased speed
requirements especially on the railways the
implementations of the circular arc were examined. The
examination result showed that the solution failed as the
speed increased which caused significant problems
related to the vehicle-road dynamics. Therefore it is
necessary to investigate new solutions in order to
increase traveling safety and comfort. Properly design
transition curve provide a calm and comfortable ride, a
correct and safe movement of a road motor vehicle, and
reducing the cost for maintenance and repair, especially
on railways [7],[8]
The lateral change of acceleration (LCA) is the most
important criterion determining the conformity of
horizontal geometry of road related to the vehicle-road
system [3], [4], [10]. The ideal case regarding the
vehicle-road dynamics is that the function of LCA
should have a continuous graph. When this criterion is
taken into account it is not possible to describe the spiral
curve as an ideal transition curve. Discontinuities of

This paper describes a G transition curve based on
quartic Bezier spiral to be used in the design of
horizontal geometry of routes. The curve that joins two
straight lines will be the composition of spiral-circular
arc-spiral forms. It is an alternative curve to
traditionally used transition spiral; Clothoid. A family of
quartic Bezier spiral is defined from analyzing the
monotone curvature conditions, and has G 3 points of
contact properties, which is better than clothoid in terms
of smooth transitions regarding to the vehicle-road
dynamics. The function of the lateral change of
acceleration (LCA) of the curves are applied and
illustrated, by means to make the comparison between
the transition curve based on quartic Bezier spiral and
the traditional transition spiral.
Keywords – spiral, transition curve, lateral change of
acceleration, quartic Bezier

1. Introduction
Transition curves are useful in several CAD
applications. They are used for blending in the plane that
is to round corners or for smooth transition between
straight line and circular arc, two circular arcs, or two
straight lines. For visual smoothness it is desirable that
the resulting curve have positional and curvature
continuity as well as continuity of the unit tangent
vector. Such continuity is usually referred to in the CAD
and CAGD (computer-aided geometric design) literature
as G 2 continuity. Higher order of continuity will ensure
smoother transition curve, and it does have direct
physical meaning on moving body along this path.
Curves with monotone curvature are called spirals
[11]. It is widely accepted that a planar spiral is fair (has
a pleasing look) since it contain neither inflection points,
singularities, nor curvature extrema [5],[12]. Such curves
are useful for transition curves. The importance of fair
curves in design process is well documented in the
literature [5], [6], [12]. In the literature, many studies are

in order to reduce wear and increase comfort by setting
the bank angle. For superelevation function, which has a
functional structure similar to the curvature function and
can be derived as U = U Max rκ , where U Max is the
maximum superelevation [4]. And finally, U ' is the first
derivative of the superelevation.
Three elements in (1); κ = κ ( A ) function of

LCA function which refer as jumps will occur if there is
sudden chance in speed of curvature.
This paper proposes a method to construct G 3
transition curve joining two straight lines by composing
a pair of quartic spiral and circular arc. The important
remarks is this new combination of spiral- circular arcspiral based on quartic spiral will be referring as new
transition curve in this discussion. While combination of
clothoid-circular arc-clothoid is refer as clothoid
transition curve.
The remaining part of this paper is organized as
follows. In Section 2, gives a brief discussion of
background and notation. We derivate the LCA, and give
an exclusive discussion on clothoid transition curve. In
Section 3, we defined a family of planar quartic Bezier
spiral. The new transition curve and its LCA functions
are shown in Section 4. Examples of the new and
clothoid transition curve are presented in Section 5.
Finally, we discussed the comparison between new and
clothoid transition curve in Section 6.

variation of curvature; U = U ( A ) function of variation of
superelevation; and w = w ( A ) function of variation of
velocity should be known for calculation of LCA.

2.2 Transition Curve between two straight lines

In practice the common type of transition curve is
combination of spiral- arc circle -spiral as illustrated in
Figure 1. In a classical transition curve, two straight lines
are joined with a combined curve that has a total length
of L. This combined curve is formed by a circular arc
(radius r and length L2 ) and two basic transition curves
(length L1 and L3 ); TQ = transition point from straight
line to curve; M 1 = transition point from curve to circular
arc; M 2 = transition point from circular arc to curve; and
TF = transition point from curve to straight line. Cubic
parabola, biquadratic, parabola, clothoid curve, spiral
curve, Bloss curve, sinusoid, and others can be used as a
basic transition curve [4], [5]. They are however
nonpolynomial and not very flexible. In this paper only
clothoid curve will be considered as classical transition
curve because it is most commonly used in practice.

2. Background
In the literature, there are different equations of the
lateral change of acceleration. Some of them give results
due to the unit inconsistencies, and other is only valid for
the conditions of special geometry and vehicle motion.
LCA is defined as the change of the resultant
acceleration along the direction of the normal to the
orbiting curve with respect to time. The resultant
acceleration is formed by the free forces (unbalanced)
acting on a vehicle with a mass, an instantaneous
velocity, and moving on a curved orbit. LCA is also
called “jerk” in mechanical engineering [3].

LCA functions of clothoid transition curve
In this section, we only discussed motion models of
constant velocity. In this model, velocity (w) is assumed
to be constant along the transition curve which gives
aT = 0 . The function LCA of the clothoid transition
curve can be derived after substituting (6), (7) into (1).
This LCA can be summarized as

Thus Bezier quartic spiral has seven degrees of

which only have five degrees of freedom. The additional
parameters of quartic spiral allow the process of the
curve construction became more flexible.

LCA is the most important criterion in the
comparison of transition curves on the basis of vehicleroad dynamics. In the literature, the following
comparison criteria are mostly used with respect to the
variation of LCA [9].
 continuity of the diagram of LCA
 number of discontinuities in the diagrams of the LCA
 magnitude of LCA.

The continuity of LCA function is the most important
criterion in the comparisons of transition curves, because
discontinuities in the forms of jumps will; affect travel
comfort in railways and motorways, cause change of
horizontal geometry of rail, and cause wear on vehicle
wheels and rails in railways. Therefore, it is clear that
any transition curve that does not have discontinuities in
form of jumps in the graph of LCA is superior to others
that have discontinuities. Form the example regarding
motion model, the new transition spiral does not have
any discontinuity in the form of jump, while clothoid
curve has discontinuities at four points. Sums of positive
and negative discontinuities of the classical curve are
±0.165 m/s3.
The second important criterion is the number of
discontinuities in the form of jumps on the graph of the
LCA. From example, it’s clear that not jump occur in
LCA diagrams of new transition curve, while there are 4
jumps happen on the clothoid curve.
Finally, the third criterion is the magnitude of LCA,
which is a maximum value achieved along the curve.
The LCA values that are greater than 0.3 m / s 2 are felt
by humans, and at the limiting point of 0.6 m / s 2 humans
begin to feel discomfort [4],[7]. From the example, the
extremum values of the LCA are ±0.24 m/s3 and
±0.165 m/s3 for the new and clothoid curves,
respectively. These values are less than the boundary
values in literature. For this example, since quartic spiral
have two additional degrees of freedom over clothoid so
we can reduce the turning angle, which follows by
decreasing of extremum value of LCA. As the result, the
length of the spiral segment will be increased.

Conclusion
