is usually in the range of 0 to 255 (if 256 levels are
used).
Thresholding produces a new image based on the
original one represented by F. It is basically another
function g, which produces a new image (i.e. the
thresholded image). A threshold is calculated for each
pixel value. This threshold is compared with the
original image (i.e. F) to determine the new value of
the current pixel. g can be represented by equation
1[2].

Abstract
This paper introduces Textured Renyi Entropy for
image thresholding based on a novel combination
mechanism. The Renyi Entropy is extended by
modifying its priori, while still preserving overall
functionality. An optional priori is introduced to
improve accuracy. The priori modification allows
adding of texture information in an efficient way,
which results in more accurate thresholding.
Furthermore, the proposed mechanism allows adding
other features after some normalization. Finally the
novel way allows adding multiple features
simultaneously using the modified priors.

1.1 Entropy in image processing
Keywords--- Renyi Entropy, Threshold, Texture.

Entropy is a term that is difficult to define in a
general sense. Simply put, entropy refers to the amount
of information that can be obtained from a set of
messages [3] and was first introduced in information
theory.
When applied to image processing techniques,
entropy measures the normality (i.e. normal or
abnormal) of a particular gray level distribution of an
image. When a whole image is considered, the entropy
as defined in Eq.2 will indicate to what extent the
intensity distribution is normal. When we extend this
concept to image segmentation, i.e. dealing with
foreground and background regions in an image, the
entropy is calculated for both regions, and the
subsequent entropy value provides an indication of the
normality of the segmentation. In this case, two
equations are need for each region, each of them called
priori.
The Renyi Entropy (RE) is one of many types of
entropy introduced by Renyi in 1961 [4].

1. Introduction
In image thresholding division/segmentation of an
image into two or more regions is done by calculating
one or more values to act as a boundary. There have
been many approaches to image thresholding that has
been presented in the literature. A complete review of
the different classification for image thresholding can
be found in [1]. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to calculate the threshold for global
binarisation of gray level images. We call our approach
Textured Renyi entropy image thresholding. The
proposed method injects the textured feature into Renyi
entropy by modifying the entropy prioris.
A gray level image can be represented by an
intensity function, which determines the gray level
value for each pixel in the image. Specifically, an
intensity function F, takes as input a particular pixel
from the image, and outputs its gray level value, which

calculated by combining these initial threshold values
and the corresponding values of the prioris H1 and H2
using the following equation:

Over the years, RE has been applied to image
thresholding in a number of different ways [5,6,7,8].
Renyi entropy for image thresholding was
implemented first using certain modifications and
normalization mechanisms [5]. Subsequently, other
image features mainly the averaging neighborhood,
were used along with RE to increase the thresholding
accuracy. The early mechanisms utilized a 1dimensional histogram that represents the number of
pixels at each gray level. Thus, it can be called as 1dimensional Renyi. The later mechanism [6] utilized a
two-dimensional histogram representing the number of
the pixels at each gray level and each neighborhood’s
average value. This is called as 2-dimensional Renyi.
More details on the previous work in RE are discussed
in Section 2. Section 3 presents our proposed textured
Renyi entropy algorithm. An adaptable algorithm is
presented to accommodate additional features, whose
experimental results are shown in Section 4.

The chosen values of α is based on experimental
results. Sahoo and Arora [6] work on Kapur et al’s
difficult question [7] - “What happens if two different
pictures have the same gray-level histogram and thus
the same threshold? Will it be suitable for both?”. This
question motivated Sahoo and Arora [6] to investigate
the two-dimensional Renyi. In fact, our own
motivation stems from Sahoo and Arura’s [6] previous
work in which we wanted to enhance their formulation
for 2D Renyi Entropy and increase the accuracy using
texture features.
Sahoo and Arora’s [6] solution is based on the
average value of the neighborhoods as similar to the
method proposed by [8] for entropy based
thresholding. The two-dimensional entropy considers
the averaging of 3x3 blocks of the neighborhoods of
each pixel, in so doing, this technique is able to go
beyond the simplest threshold technique, but on the
other hand it gives the entropy more accurate results.
Figure 1 illustrates the two-dimensional histogram.

2. Previous work
The different approaches to using RE for image
thresholding are based on the law of probabilities. Two
priories are at the heart of the RE, each of which
represent the foreground and the background. They are
viewed as the summation of the probabilities of the
pixels’ gray levels. The probabilities of the pixels at
each gray level are combined using some mathematical
operations. And the final threshold is the maximum
priori combination value. This is what is referred to as
the Maximum Entropy.
In image thresholding, when applying maximum
entropy, every gray level value is a candidate to be the
threshold value. Each value will be used to classify the
pixels into two groups based on their gray levels and
their affinity, as less or greater than the threshold
value. Formula 3 represents the Renyi threshold
formula; the prioris H1 and H2 represent the
foreground and the background and the chosen
threshold value (T) has to maximize their combination
according to the third equation.

Wu et. al. [8] focused on reducing the complexity
of the two-dimensional Entropy using fast recurring
algorithm. In their approach, the two-dimensional
histogram in Figure 2 was divided into four quadrants
using demo threshold values for the gray level and the
average neighborhood. According to Wu et. al. [8], the

Sahoo et al [5] proposed a new method which
extends the original one [7] by choosing three initial
threshold values. The initial threshold values are those
that maximize the output T of equation 3 based on
three different values for α. The final threshold value is

goals which are:
• Maximize the intra-correlation by minimizing
the intra-texture features.
• Minimizing
the
inter-correlation
by
maximizing the inter-texture features.

second and the fourth quadrant represents noise and
unwanted information in the image as it represent high
level gray values pixels with low average
neighborhood values and vice versa.
The two dimensional entropy also introduces
additional accuracy [6,8]. However, this mechanism is
still restricted within the local neighborhood
information. It is not likely to be used in a fashion
similar to global thresholding.

To use texture with Renyi, the two prioris H1 and
H2 has to be modified in a way that preserves
functionality. The prioris are summation of
probabilities values which can be used in any type of
data as long as it can be represented as probability
values.
The texture feature must be represented in the
same way as the gray level. Normalization process is
used to convert the feature values into probability
values allocated with each gray level.
However, the effect of the texture distribution is
opposite to the effect of the gray level distribution.
The original entropy aim at maximize the uniformity of
the distributions by dividing the gray levels into two
groups represent the background and the foreground in
uniform way. On the other hand, the texture features
are undesirable to be uniform within the foreground
and the background. Thus, the aim of the entropy has
to be modified from maximizing into minimizing the
texture within the distributions.
Thus, using the original prioris with the texture
will set the effects oppositely and result in totally
uncorrelated regions. To set the equations in the proper
direction, we have modified the priori equations by
converting (1 1 − α ) into − 1 / (1 − α ) . Thus, the texturebased priori is constructed as shown in Equation 6.

3. Integration of Renyi entropy with
texture features
Renyi entropy has been utilized for image
thresholding in two ways. It is either used in its
original formulation [5] in which the one-dimensional
histogram is used or alternately, by integrating the
entropy value with the neighborhood average in a two
dimensional histogram as in [6,8]. In the latter
approach, the integration of entropy with neighborhood
averages is mainly to enhance the results of the
thresholding process. Apart from that, this integration
also provides a solution to the problem posed by Kapur
et al [7]. However, the proposed method is strictly
limited to the averaging neighborhood since the two
dimensional histogram is only able to represent two
strongly connected features. Besides, the neighborhood
averaging is a local feature which we feel does not
optimally contribute towards effective global
thresholding because the correlation of the individual
pixels in the global sense has been lost.
A desirable image segmentation approach has to
maximize the correlation between the pixels in each
region and minimize the correlation between the
different regions
To preserve the correlation with the different
regions using Renyi entropy, we have proposed to use
a texture feature. In our approach, we have chosen
wavelet coefficients that are calculated for each pixel
over three different neighborhoods of 9, 16, and 25
pixels. The pixels with high wavelet coefficient values
have low correlation within its neighborhood. Thus,
those pixels with wavelet coefficient values are
discarded out of any regions.
The proposed Renyi prioris are calculated for the
texture features. The mechanism of the prioris work to
produce single value that minimize the textured in the
distributions, one way of doing this is to through the
high textured pixels out the segments. However, the
Renyi entropy in specific and the entropy in general
have only two prioris which correspond to two regions.
Thus, to locate the pixels with high wavelet
coefficients, this paper introduces a new priori to
represent the area to be binarised. The original and

*TP: The textured value at the gray level i, in a form of probability
value.

To calculate the texture within the object, we
calculate the texture property at each gray level by
aggregating the textures properties for pixels with the
same gray value. The texture values are normalized to
the range of [0-1] and the total value for texture
properties in the image has to be equal to 1, which is
equivalent to the gray level probability representation.
However, to preserve the functionality of the
original entropy, we have proposed to combine the
proposed and the original priori into a single priori. To
provide equal weighting for the original and the
textured-based prioris, the two priories are combined
using an addition operation as indicated in Equation 7.

Moreover, we have added new priori to the
previous two prioris. This new priori calculates the
texture property on the threshold region and minimizes
the correlation within this region by maximizing the
texture between the segments. Thus, in the new priori,
called G, the texture property is maximized. The new
priori with the modified maximum entropy is
represented in Equation 8.

The flexibility of the novel method proposed in the
previous section allows us to incorporate various
features in the prioris. In a similar manner, this method
may be utilized to introduce other features which might
enhance the thresholding result.

Figure 5 shows two thresholded images using
Texture Renyi method. The original images are
provided in the appendix.
The image in 5a has noisy characters, while the
second one is considerably less noisy. The thresholding
operation using the proposed method for these images
resulted in the same threshold value. This is because
the high value for the texture located on the character
edges. The proposed method does not add any
improvement in such case, wherein the noise has
affected the features badly.
More comparison results with the error rates are
provided in Appendix A. The error rate is defined as
the number of the misclassified pixels divided by the
total number of pixels. The experimental results show
that the proposed method improves the result by
reducing the error rate by 1/2 to 2/3.

4. Experimental results
This section discusses the results obtained using
the proposed Texture Renyi Entropy method. The
discussion will focus on sample images, while the
complete set of images will be provided in Appendix
A.
Figure 2 and 3 shows the result of thresholding
using the original entropy and the proposed method
respectively. The original entropy resulted in a
threshold value of (187) while the proposed method
resulted in a better result as illustrated in Figure 3. We
have realized that the proposed method here mimics
the edge detection techniques where in the edges in the
image normally have a high texture values.
Figure 4 shows another binarised image. Again,
the introduced G priori has played a major role in the
effective binarisation of the image.

for image thresholding has been developed using novel
method. The Textured Renyi method was developed by
introducing texture feature and modifying the original
prioris. Besides, the proposed method adds one more
priori. The experimental results show that the proposed
method enhances the thresholding result and reduce the
error rate by ½ to 2/3. Finally, this paper discussed
how to add other features to the entropy prioris.
