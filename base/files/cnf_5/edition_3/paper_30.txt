environments. They also scatter and absorb
visible radiation which limiting visibility.
We used Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR and
Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations
(CALIPSO) image of aerosol and clouds
from backscattered signals. CALIPSO is in
a 98º inclination orbit with an altitude of
705 km that able to provides daily maps of
aerosol and clouds distribution [2]. The
CALIPSO payload occupied with three
instruments: the Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR
with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP),
an Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and
a moderate spatial resolution Wide-Field
Camera (WFC). The WFC characteristics
is shown in Table 1 [3]. Our objective is to
differentiate aerosols and clouds in the
CALIPSO image by using
EASI
modelling algorithms.

Abstract
Algorithms to distinguish between
clouds and aerosols are important in the
environmental and remote sensing study.
The colour-modulated image from Cloud
Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder
Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) has been
analysed in this study. CALIPSO is
currently obtaining global aerosol and
cloud measurements from space. We study
the possibility to apply EASI modelling
algorithms to differentiate aerosols and
clouds in the CALIPSO image. This image
processing method has shown good
outcome for visualization analysis.

Introduction
Table 1. Wide-Field Camera (WFC)
parameters

The concern of differentiating
between aerosol and cloud is a very rapidly
grow among researcher who involved in
environmental and remote sensing field.
The overlaying of clouds over aerosol and
vice versa, is a motivation among
researcher to find way to distinguish them.
Aerosol is very important in the global
climatic study because of its direct
radiative force which scatter and absorb
solar and infrared radiation in the
atmosphere [1]. Aerosols will affect the
cloud process by increasing the droplet
(water or ice) number concentration with
its indirect radiative force. Aerosols also
are a respiratory health hazard at the high
concentrations normally found in urban

Methodology

The study area is located between
latitude -32.93º S to 15.83º N and longitude
109.46º E to 98.42º E. This is one of the
region that has been captured by CALIPSO
on 1 April 2007. The data were provided
by the NASA Langley Research Center
Atmospheric Science Data Center.
Visual
interpretation
towards
CALIPSO image attenuated backscatter at
532 nm is made first. The color assigned to
each pixel represents the intensity of the
return signal in digitizer counts. The count
values range from 1x10-4 for the lowest or
negligible return to a value less than 1x10-1
for the strongest return.
There are some regions in the
CALIPSO colour-modulated image that
have mixed of aerosol and clouds. This
overlaid give difficulty in order to observe
the distribution of aerosol and clouds
clearly in the atmosphere. To develop the
algorithms, we focus on clouds and aerosols
digital number (DN) from the CALIPSO
image. The image is then being process
using EASI modelling by applying the
algorithm below for aerosols:

while %1 is a red layer, %2 is a green
layer, %3 is a blue layer and %4 is a new
added layer.

Data Analysis and Results

A complete scene which the vertical
coordinates of each feature are given by the
Y-axis values (i.e., altitude) and the lower
X-axis provides a temporal coordinate
given in mission elapsed time (MET) is
shown in Fig. 2.
The absolute and
uncalibrated backscatter intensity is colourcoded, with the weakest scattering shown
in blue and the strongest scattering shown
in white.

(%1=255 and %2=212 and %3=0) or
(%1=255 AND %2=127 AND %3=0) or
(%1=255 AND %2=170 AND %3=0) then

The aerosols layers mostly occupied
betweeen the surface and ~3 km vertically.
The distribution of aerosols at higher
altitude are uneasy to determine because of
overlapping condition between aerosols
with clouds. There are also some region of
the scene that has optically thick features
which demonstrated by the shadows

beneath it. As the beam is totally
attenuated, the shadows become more
prominent and makes the features below
increasingly hard to detect. Below are the
images that have been processed by using
EASI

The visual distribution of aerosol and
clouds have been enhanced and
differentiate visually as shown in Figure 3
(i) and (ii). We have eliminated either
clouds or aerosols in the images

respectively. The vertical distribution of
aerosols are concentrated at troposphere
within altitude 0 to 5 km and decreasingly
distributed when the altitude is higher.

Conclusions
We have obtained good results which
shows clearer image of aerosols and clouds
distribution.
The
developed
EASI
modelling algorithms has successfully
differentiated aerosols and clouds in the
atmosphere. This image processing
technique is compromising well with
CALIPSO image.
