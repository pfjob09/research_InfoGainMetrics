standards often refer to respirable suspended particulate
matter (PM), being aerosols with a diameter smaller than
2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5). The generated algorithm was based on the
aerosol optical depth. Aerosols scatter and absorb solar
radiation. The scattering and absorption features depend on
their chemical and physical properties. In populated areas,
black carbon is responsible for most of the aerosol
absorption while biomass burning prevails in tropical
regions. The aerosol absorption spectrum is uniformly
distributed along the solar spectrum and is proportional to
the aerosol scattering decreasing with wavelength [1]. Daily
remote sensing of aerosol from satellite over the land and
ocean is essential to obtain the global aerosol budget to
estimate the contribution of anthropogenic emission to the
aerosol budget and to the aerosol radiative forcing of
climate. Because of the short lifetime of aerosol particles
and the corresponding strong spatial variations in the
aerosol concentration ground-based stations cannot assess
trends in the global aerosol budget [2]. We are using image
from SPOT over Penang Island for PM2.5 mapping. The
PM2.5 values were collected simultaneously with the
satellite overpass the study area and their locations were
determined using a handheld GPS. The data were used for
algorithm regression analysis. The objective of this study is
to evaluate the feasibility of SPOT image for providing a
high spatial resolution air quality map.

Abstract
Air pollution is an important issue being monitored and
regulated in industrial and developing cities. In this study,
we explored the relationship between particulate matters of
size less than 2.5 micron (PM2.5) derived from the SPOT
using regression technique. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the high spatial resolution satellite data for air
quality mapping by using FLAASH software. The
corresponding PM2.5 data were measured simultaneously
with the acquired satellite scene and their locations were
determined using a handheld Global Positioning System
(GPS). Due to the fact that the current commercial aerosol
retrieval method (FLAASH) was designed to work
reasonably well over land, but is not accurate for water
applications, adjustments had to be made to the software to
optimize it for reflectance retrieval over water. In-situ
reflectance spectra will be plot against spectra derived from
the atmospherically corrected images. In this study, we
ensure that all the atmospherically corrected spectra match
reasonably with the in-situ spectra. We have developed a
new algorithm that can effectively estimate the spatial
distribution of atmospheric aerosols and retrieve surface
reflectance from remotely sensed imagery under general
atmospheric and surface conditions. The algorithm was
developed base on the aerosol characteristics in the
atmosphere. The efficiency of the developed algorithm, in
comparison to other forms of algorithm, will be investigated
in this study.Results indicate that there is a good correlation
between the satellites derived PM2.5 and the measured
PM2.5. This study shows the potential of using the thermal
infrared data for air quality mapping. The finding obtained
by this study indicates that the FLAASH can be used to
retrieve air quality information for remotely sensed data.

2. Study Area
The study area is the Penang Island, Malaysia
within latitudes 5o 12â€™ N to 5o 30â€™ N and longitudes 100o 09â€™
E to 100o 26â€™ E. The map of the region is shown in Figure 1.
The satellite image was acquired on 30 January 2005. The
corresponding PM2.5 measurements were collected
simultaneously during the satellite overpass.

Equations (7) are substituted into equation (5). The result
was a two bands algorithm as shown in equation (8). Form
the equation, we found that PM2.5 was linearly related to
the reflectance for band 1 and band 3. This algorithm was
generated based on the linear relationship between Ä² and
reflectance. Other researcher also found that the PM2.5 was
linearly related to the Ä² and the correlation coefficient for
linear was better that exponential in their study). This
means that reflectance was linear with the PM2.5. In this
study, we are replacing the density with the concentration
of pollutant, G in the calculation below.

where
Ä²r = Aerosol optical thickness (Molecule)
Pr( 4 ) = Rayleigh scattering phase function
Î¼v = Cosine of viewing angle
Î¼s = Cosine of solar zenith angle
We assume that the atmospheric reflectance due to particle,
Ra, is also linear with the Ä²a [3, 4]. This assumption is
reasonable because other studied also found the linear
relationship between both aerosol and molecule scattering
[5].

reflectance to obtain the atmospheric reflectance. And then
the atmospheric reflectance was related to the PM2.5 using
the regression algorithm analysis. The PM2.5 map was
generated using the proposed algorithm (Figure 3). This
produced a smoother goecoded image to reduce the random
noise. The generated map was colour-coded for visual
interpretation.

4. Data Analysis and Results
SPOT satellite data was selected corresponding to
the ground truth measurements of the pollution levels
(Figure 2). The PCI Geomatica version 9.1 image
processing software was used in all the analyses. The
images were rectified using the second order polynomial
coordinates transformation to relate ground control points
(GCP) in the map to their equivalent row and column
positions in the SPOT scene. The DNs were extracted
corresponding to the in-situ data locations for regression
analysis. The DN values used in this study were smoothed
using an average filter of 3 by 3 window size. The images
were rectified using the second order polynomial
coordinates transformation to relate ground control points
(GCP) in the map to their equivalent row and column
positions in the TM scene. The DN values corresponding to
the PM2.5 stations were extracted for the three bands
analysis using a 3 by 3 window size.
The satellite observation signal was the sum of the
surface reflectance and atmospheric reflectance. We used
FLAASH in the image processing software to create a
surface reflectance image. The reflectance measured from
the satellite [reflectance at the top of atmospheric, U(TOA)]
was subtracted by the amount given by the surface

Conclusion
The result produce by this study indicated the used
of SPOT satellite image for PM2.5 mapping over Penang
Island. A good agreement was found in this study between
PM2.5 measured by the DustTrak Aerosol Monitor 8520
and PM2.5 estimated using the newly proposed developed
algorithm.
