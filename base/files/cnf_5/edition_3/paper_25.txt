image separation between regions are usually imprecise
as occurs in shadows, bright and color gradients, also
crisp techniques are not often appropriate. Color image
segmentation is often viewed as a clustering problem in
2, 3, 5 or higher dimensional space [2], where the pixels
are projected into a feature space containing spatial
features (the pixel’s location in the image), color features
(color space coordinates) and possibly other features (for
example, the gradient value) [6]. Some approaches
propose a fuzzy subset for pixels in the region, by this
definition each pixel of the image has a membership
degree to that region [9, 10]. Therefore, it needs
appropriate membership function and algorithm to find
parameters of membership function. Some algorithm are
supervised by using seed point and path-growing [10, 11]
or initiating by preprocessing[9] . To solve this problem,
some approaches propose the definition of region as a
fuzzy subset of pixels, in such a way that every pixel of
the image has a membership degree to that region [12,
13].

Abstract

Segmentation and also partitioning image into
disjoint subsets are one of the most important stages in
many computer vision applications. In this paper the new
algorithm for dividing colour image into homogeneous
regions is proposed. In this algorithm we use histogram
estimation in 3 channels - RED, GREEN and BLUE - to
create adaptive membership functions that update
dynamically when the entire image is scanned. These
triple membership functions characterise each region in
image. For producing the proper estimation of
histograms, the Non-Symmetric Gaussian Function
(NSGF) is proposed. To achieve real time
implementation, the algorithm scans the image in raster
fashion. Finally, the performance of algorithm is shown
in the result of applying this algorithm to natural and
synthetic noisy images.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
In Section 2, we define a region by fuzzy concept.
Section 3 provides details of fuzzy homogeneity criteria
to characterize a region. Implementing algorithm in
parallel situation is described in section 4. Finally,
section 5 is shown the result of applying proposed
algorithm to some natural and synthesis image in noisy
area.

1. Introduction
In many image processing and computer vision
systems, the image segmentation task as a pre-processing
stage to isolate object from the background or
partitioning the scene into some regions is required. The
output of image segmentation algorithm is homogenous
extracted regions with certain boundary. But usually
natural images do not have well-defined boundary to
separate regions from each other.
Techniques of segmentation usually are based on
histogram analysis[1], clustering [2] , split and merge
[3], region growing [4] and edge based algorithms [5].
Most of the proposals falling in the literature categories
provide a crisp segmentation of images, where each pixel
has to belong to a unique region[6]. One of the most
important application of segmentation is Real-Time
systems[7, 8]. These types of applications usually have
natural images and unknown environments, thus it need
fast algorithm for partitioning of images and precise
region is not the main goal. As we see in the natural

2. Fuzzy Region
As we know human perception from a segment is
fuzzy, the meaning of some pixels in the edges will be
connected to a segment by different resemblance value to
different regions. If a region marked by human, the
histogram of this region would be shown as figure 1. In
color segmentation, the histogram of region seems
appropriate feature. In this paper we propose three fuzzy
membership functions to each new segment and fit them
to amplitude of interest in the color histogram. To
achieve this goal we can use the function of many
members such as S-function
, Cosine-function,

165

Triangular-function and Gaussian function [10, 12,14].
As shown in figure 1 Red histogram of marked segment
is likely Gaussian shape but it is non symmetric
Gaussian, so we approximate probability density
function for marked area as follow:

⎧ k e − (( x − x ) /σ L )2
⎪
p( x) = ⎨
− (( x − x ) / σ R ) 2
⎪⎩ k e

if ( x ≤ x )

The μp function is normalized of probability
histogram of marked region as shown in figure 2 that is
Non Symmetric Gaussian Function (NSGF) which the
left side of this function we have a semi Gaussian
function by σ L standard derivation and the other side we
have same function by σR. We proposed μp as a
membership function in features of region. A region
represent by features vector witch can be use the color
space in RGB, HIS or HSV [9], Due to many camera use
the standard color RGB (Red Green Blue), we have
chosen RGB color space in obtaining homogeneously
colored regions as follow:

Hence, the feature vector we use to characterize
each pixel in the image contains its three band color.
Finally in our approach each pixel that μp > α for all
features with fuzzy connectivity is called fuzzy region.
The threshold value α defines for detail partitions.

The objective of segmentation is to partition an
image into regions with similar properties. Many
different approaches have been suggested for the
resemblance pixel to a region. The resemblance between
particular features or sub vectors is calculated, depending
on the specific feature domain such as membership
functions parameters that we called features vector in the
previous section, when this domain are close together
then resulting measures will be aggregated to a region in
this process fuzzy region maybe increase or decrease.
The grade of similarity is evaluated for each region
by a homogeneity criterion. Since, we defined
homogeneity in colored regions by fuzzy similarity
between pixel attributes (RGB) and features of region.
Consider the region that we work on is homogeneous
regarding by Rp as follow:

The value of I has two different cases:

New Region: when I=0 implies that current pixel doesn’t
satisfy the similarity criteria, so, new region will be
started at this pixel and feature parameters initiate.
Previous Region: The current pixel will be added to most
similar adjacent region when I>0, in this case the feature
parameters ( x and σR , σL ) will be updated as follow :

4. Algorithm Implementation
To perform this algorithm, the image scan in raster
fashion from left to right and top to bottom and three
phases applied to current pixel simultaneously. In the
raster scan model, current pixel X has 4 processing
adjacent pixels named N1, N2, N3, N4 as shown in Figure
4. Therefore in this algorithm we need to keep only n+1
structure of information where n is the row size of image.
One structure for each column unless column before
current pixel that has two structure. Structures include
the segment information that ended in each column.

Finally, we employ Dubois-Prade T-norm to
determine the homogeneous degree between pixel
Xp=(xr,xg,xb) and region Rp as follow:

Where FuzzyHomo is a value in the [0, 1] , that
represents homogeneity measure between attribute vector
of pixel Xp and membership functions of region Rp . In
this case low values of t-norm means large difference
and also high values will be similar to region. This way,
the difference between the support and the kernel of the
membership function of the fuzzy region will be smaller,
as the region is crisper. Two pixels are inside in the one
region when they are connected, that means there is a
path linking them such that all the consecutive pixels in

This set of structures can be implemented by a list
that linked with together and make a circular linked list
as shown in Figure 5. One of the 3 phases of algorithm
called homogeneity testing, to find out the blobs which
current pixel can be added to that. In the second phase,
to avoid of fragmentation of output labeled image by
neighbor segments with same characteristics, the
merging process is applied. In the last phase, noise
segments that appear by small blobs is detected and
eliminated. The overall schema of this algorithm is
shown in Figure 6.

This phase determines the neighbor blob that current
pixel is belong to that. To achieving good result fuzzy
method consideration is used. In this case, Fuzzy
similarity measures between current pixel x and each
adjacent fuzzy region that ended at 4 neighbor pixels are
computed. A dynamic threshold is used to determine a
region that current pixel can be added to that. If
maximum fuzzy similarity of current pixel is less than a
threshold, the new segment is started and current pixel
labeled as starting point.

6. Conclusion

(a)

In this paper, a new method for extracting segments
from images in a pipelined fashion is presented. The
advantage of this method is that while images are
scanned in a raster fashion, the segments are extracted.
For this purpose, only one row is kept and for each pixel
in the row, a linked list is made. While a new node is
supposed to be added to its preceding node, the
coordinates of the preceding node is transferred to the
current node. This process is continued until all image
pixels are covered.

This algorithm uses the simplified Non Symmetric
Gaussian Function (NSGF) for histogram estimation as a
membership function in fuzzy resemblance. Also, it uses
only simple mathematical operations in addition to its
simple data structure. This algorithm can be
implemented in hardware for use in video rate
application.
