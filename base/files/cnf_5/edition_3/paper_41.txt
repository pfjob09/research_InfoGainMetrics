can be defined as boundary between two regions
separated by two relatively distinct gray-level properties
[2]. The process of edge detection reduces an image to its
edge details that appear as the outlines of image objects
that are often used for feature extraction and object
recognition.
Recent researchers that deployed and exploited
fuzzy techniques were [3-8]. Tizhoosh [3] introduced
heuristic memberships function, simple fuzzy rules and
fuzzy complements in his edge detector system.
Becerikli et al[4] designed a new fuzzy approach using a
rule based also for an edge detection. Kim et al[5] too
took the advantage of fuzzy technique in their automated
edge detection by adopting fuzzy-based edge
thresholding. Meanwhile, Hanmandlu et al [6] used
entropy optimization in their fuzzy approach for edge
detection. In El-Khamy et al[7], they proposed a new
fuzzy technique using minimum entropy in the edge
detection system. Lastly, a new adaptive fuzzy technique
was presented by Yang [8] for the same purpose of edge
detection. All the above papers use the triangular and
trapezoid membership function.
Hirota et al[10] employed both triangular and
Gaussian membership functions in image compression.
See et al[11] introduced fuzzy-based Gaussian edge
detector that uses both global and local image properties
for grayscale images.
In this paper, we introduce the use of Gaussian
shape membership function to refine fuzzy rules edge
detection in detecting cortical edges of phantom hand
radiographs.

Abstract
The paper introduced the Gaussian shaped
membership function to the Rule Based Fuzzy(RBF)
image detection. It is expected that the proposed
algorithm Gaussian Rule Based Fuzzy(GRBF) method
can further refined the detection of periosteal and
endosteal edges of hand phantom radiographs. The
experimental data consists of four sets of hand phantom
radiograph. Only metacarpal 2, 3 and 4 are considered.
All of these data are processed using both GRBF and
RBF. Mean and median filters are used as preprocessing
tools. The results are compared both subjectively and
statistically. The periosteal(strong edges) are well
detected by both RBF and GRBF. However GRBF
performs better than RBF in detecting the endosteal
edges(weak edges).

Introduction

Radiographic digital imaging is used for various
procedures in many medical disciplines. Bone tissue
examination is one of the most common use of
radiographic digital imaging. However, radiographic
imaging is known for its blur edge, low contrast, and
detail faintness. The quality of the imaging is attributed
to the scattering effect, radiation dosage and complexity
of the image structure[1]. This experiment uses a hand
radiograph as mean for bone strength measurement. The
initial stage of measuring the bone strength is through
detection of its periosteal and endosteal outlines. The
outline is usually very unclear which complicates
identification of edges.
Fuzzy techniques in edge detection are becoming
more prominent in digital image processing. An edge

The radiographs used in this research are digitized

typically suffer from low resolution (in spatial and
spectral domain, high level of noise, low contrast,

Result and Discussions

Two methods are identified to evaluate both
algorithms. The results of the experiments are based on
the testing the images with different threshold values
with the application of mean and median filters.
Evaluation is made in two part. In the first part,
comparisons are made visually and quantitatively
between the edges detected by processing the original
image and the image processed with the smoothing
filters with RBF and GRBF. In the second part,
comparison are made between the most significant edge
detection results for images processed with RBF and
GRBF regardless of threshold levels.
The first analysis is done through visual inspection,
i.e the subjective analysis. Then, statistical analysis is
done by calculating the number of edge pixel detected in

The membership functions for the above rules are
defined as follows:-

If W is a ω x ω neighborhood pixels,
and difference between the minimum gray level in
W(gmin) and the maximum gray level in W(gmax) is
normalized by global image intensity range is high
and the center pixel(gmn) is equal to mean value,
then the edginess is high.

The rule based fuzzy edge detection used in this
paper is adapted from [3]. The original equation had a
range of gray level between 0 and 255 as the
normalization value. This value is only effective for
images with high gray level ranges and high edge
gradient. The gray level range of the phantom
radiographs images in this study is lower (Table 1) and
thus the membership values have to be normalized at a
lower range between 103 and 164 with an average range
of 144. Smoothing filter will further reduce this range.
Edge is characterized as relatively high difference
between maximum and minimum gray levels. The rules
used in the algorithm are stated below:

A threshold value T is used to differentiate a high
edge and a lower edge.

Smoothing filter is employed in noise reduction of
the radiographs from noise and artifact. Both
linear(mean) and nonlinear (median) filter are used to
tackle the noise.
Mean filtering is a simple, intuitive and easy to
implement method for noise reduction. The mean filter
reduces the amount of intensity variation between one
pixel and the next which causes the blurring effect.
Median filtering is a non-linear enhancement
technique for image smoothing. It can suppress the
impulse noise while preserving the edges.

is presented and discussed in the following sections.

4.1

Comparison of the performance of RBF
and GRBF with identical threshold

The results shows that, as the threshold level T is
increased from 0.15 to 0.4, the number of edges detected
decreases for RBF but the opposite for GRBF. The
thresholds have been selected within this range due to
two reasons. Threshold set below 0.15 is too sensitive as
too many false positive edges detected by both RBF and
GRBF. Whereas threshold set above 0.4, generate output
with too little true positive edges for RBF and GRBF.
In all cases (Figures 1-12), with or without
preprocessing and by varying the threshold, RBF and
GRBF algorithms have successfully detected the
periosteal edges. Odd numbered Figures 1-12 are images
processed with RBF and even numbered figures are
images processed with GRBF. Figures 1-12, labeled (a)
and (b) are the original image and processed images.
Figures 1-12, labeled (c) and (d) are images preprocessed
using 3x3 and 5x5 mean filters and Figures 1-12, labeled
(e) and (f) are edge detected images preprocessed with
3x3 and 5x5 median filters .
Images processed with RBF detects strong edges
(endosteal edges) well however, this is not true for the
weaker edges (endosteal edges. As the threshold
increases, the RBF becomes less sensitive to endosteal
edges. Endosteal has a lower gradient than periosteal.
The endosteal edges fade as threshold is increased.
However, the GRBF are more successful in endosteal
detection regardless of the threshold level. This indicates
that GRBF is more sensitive to low edges. (Figure
2,4,6,8,10 and 12). This is supported by the line graphs
in Figures 13-16.

The line graphs in Figure 13-16 show the summary
of total number of detected edge pixels at the threshold
value T=0.25, 0.30, 0.35 and 0.40 for RBF and GRBF. It
shows that GRBF is sensitive to high edge(periosteal)
and low edge(endosteal) better than the RBF. Overall, it
is observed that the total number of edge pixels reduces
with the increase of threshold level. The edge pixels
detected in the original images are the highest regardless
of the threshold value. This indicates the presence of
noise. Images preprocessed with 3x3 mask perform
better than the 5x5 masks. Median as expected performs
better than mean filters.

Comparison of the performance of RBF
and GRBF as an edge detector

Figure 18(a-d), shows edges detected using RBF and
GRBF on the original image. It is observed that both
algorithms detect true and false edges. The true edges are
defined as the edge points which are located at the bone
edges. False edges are points detected on the background
which can be considered as noise.
Figure 19(a-d), shows the edges detected using
images after preprocessed using mean filter with RBF
and GRBF. Almost all false edges are not visibled
indicating the mean filter has removed the noise.
However, the noise reduction has also reduced the
detection of the endosteal edges.
Figure 20(a–d), shows the edges detected using
images after preprocessed with median filter. Almost all
false edges are not detected indicating the median filter
has reduced the intensity of the noise. Due to the nature
of median filter, the edges of the endosteal are preserved.

In Table 1, the number of edges detected using the
RBF and GRBF algorithms are recorded. The table
indicates that the number of edges detected from the
original image and images preprocessed with mean 5x5
and median 5x5 are the same for both RBF and GRBF. A
significant difference are detected for images
preprocessed with mean 3x3 and median 3x3 where
more edges are recorded by GRBF. Therefore, in this
case GRBF is more sensitive to low edges.

Conclusions

Clearly both the algorithms are able to detect the
periosteal edges which are the strong edges Figures (113) and Figures (18-20). As a whole, GRBF is more
effective in isolating the endosteal edges as shown in
Figures (1-12). GRBF performs better than RBF for
image preprocessed with mean 3x3 and median 3x3
filters (Table 1) and Figures (18-20). In conclusion, edge
detection using GRBF offers significant improvement in
detecting strong and weak edges.
