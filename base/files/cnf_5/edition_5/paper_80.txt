Abstract
The construction of a bivariate C1 interpolant to
scattered data is considered in which the interpolant is
positive everywhere if the original data are positive.
This study is motivated by earlier work in which
sufficient conditions are derived on Bézier points in
order to ensure that surfaces comprising cubic Bézier
triangular patches are always positive and satisfy C1
continuity conditions. Initial gradients at the data sites
are estimated and then modified if necessary to ensure
that these conditions are satisfied. The construction is
local and easy to implement. Graphical examples are
presented using two test functions.

1. Introduction
In [2] and [10], the interpolating surface comprises
cubic Bézier triangular patches with sufficient
conditions imposed on the ordinates of the Bézier
control points in each triangle to guarantee
preservation of positivity. This paper will focus on
relaxing further these sufficient conditions. Various
methods concerning visualization of positive data
which use either piecewise bicubic interpolant or
piecewise cubic triangular interpolant can be found in
the literature, see for examples, [1], [2], [9] and [10]. A
piecewise bicubic function u(x, y) from the data on a
rectangular mesh is constructed in [1], where u(x, y) is
nonnegative
(positive)
everywhere.
Sufficient
conditions for positivity are derived in terms of the
first and mixed partial derivatives at the grid points.
These conditions form a basis of positive interpolation
algorithm. In [2], sufficient non-negative conditions on
the Bézier ordinates are derived to ensure the nonnegativity of piecewise cubic Bézier triangular mesh.
This is done by imposing the same lower bound value
for the edge (other than the vertices) and inner Bézier
ordinates. [10] follows a similar approach as in [2] but

offers more relaxed sufficient conditions which are
easier to compute on the ordinates of the Bézier control
1

points. In both [2] and [10], C non-parametric surfaces
are constructed. Each triangular patch of the
interpolating surface is formed as a convex
combination of three cubic Bézier triangular patches.
An initial value of inner Bézier ordinate in each
triangle is computed using the cubic precision method.
However, the disadvantage of both schemes in [2] and
[10], is that the inner and edge Bézier ordinates are
assigned the same lower bound.
Thus, in this paper, we shall derive sufficient
conditions for the lower bounds of the edge and inner
Bézier ordinates to be adjusted independently while
still ensuring positivity of the triangular patches. We
use a similar approach of construction as in [2] and
[10] but the initial value of inner Bézier ordinate in
each triangle is computed using the cross boundary
derivative along the respective edges as in [6]. This
paper is organized as follows. Sufficient conditions on
Bézier ordinates which will ensure the positivity of
cubic Bézier triangular patches will be described in
Section 2. An outline of the surface construction is
given in Section 3, while Section 4 presents graphical
examples of our proposed scheme. Finally, the
conclusions are given in Section 5.

Consider a triangle T with vertices V1, V2, V3 and
barycentric coordinates u, v, w such that a point V on
the triangle can be expressed as V=uV1 + vV2 + wV3
where u,v,w  0 and u+v+w = 1. A cubic Bézier

We can show that the real root of (3) for y1 > 0 exists.
Let f(y) = 3y4 + 4(B+C)y3 + 6BCy2 – B2C2. Since f ’(y)
= 12y3 + 12(B+C)y2 + 12BCy, f is an increasing
function for y1, B and C > 0. Since f(0) = -B2C2 < 0 and
f(B+C) = 7(B+C)4 + BC(6B2+6C2+11BC) > 0, there
exists 0 < y10 < B + C, such that f(y10) = 0 where y10 is
a unique solution of (3) in (0, ) as shown in Figure 2.

We assume that the Bézier ordinates at the vertices
are strictly positive, i.e. b300, b030, b003 > 0. We shall
derive sufficient conditions on the remaining Bézier
ordinates for the entire Bézier patch to be positive.
Note that, in [2] and [10], apart from the Bézier points
at the vertices, all the other Bézier ordinates are
assumed to have the same value. Let us assume b300 =
A, b030 = B, b003 = C where A, B, C > 0. Assume also
b021 = b012 = - y1, b201 = b102 = - y2 , b210 = b120 = -y3
and b111 = -x. Thus, (1) becomes
P(u, v, w) = Au3 + Bv3 + Cw3 - 3y1(v2w + vw2) (2)
3y2(u2w + uw2) - 3y3(u2v + uv2) -6xuvw.
Clearly when x = y1 = y2 = y3 = 0, P(u, v, w) > 0 [10].
Let the boundary curve along the edge V2V3 be
B1(w) = P(0, 1-w, w)
= Bv3 + Cw3 – 3y1(v2w + vw2)
= Bv3 + Cw3 - y1(1- v3- w3)
= (B+y1)(1-w)3 + (C+y1)w3 - y1.
B’1(w) = -3(B+y1)(1-w)2 + 3(C+y1)w2 = 0 gives

By following a similar approach for the other two
respective boundary curves, we can find the lower
bounds, y2 and y3 as the positive real roots of the
following equations respectively:
(4)
3y2 4 + 4(A+C)y2 3 + 6ACy2 2 – A2C2 = 0,
(5)
3y3 4 + 4(A+B)y3 3 + 6Aby3 2 – A2B2 = 0.
The lower bound of inner Bézier ordinates, x, can be
obtained as follows:
Let b210 = b120 = b201 = b021 = b012 = -y0, where y0 =
max(y1, y2, y3). Equation (2) can then be written as
P(u, v, w) = Au3 + Bv3 + Cw3 – 3y0(u2v + u2w + v2u +
v2w + w2u + w2v) - 6xuvw = Q(u, v, w) – 6xuvw.
If P(u, v, w)  0 then Q(u, v, w) – 6xuvw  0
Q(u, v, w)
.
(6)
or 0 < x 
6uvw
The RHS of (6) is a homogenous function. We can
then use a Lagrange multiplier in order to solve this
problem, i.e. to find x0 = min Q(u,v, w), the lower
bound of x, subject to uvw = 1.
Let F(u, v, w, Ȝ) = Q(u, v, w) + Ȝ(uvw-1) , where
Ȝ is a constant. Thus,

Proposition
Consider the cubic Bézier triangular patch P(u, v,
w) with b300 = A, b030 = B, b003 = C, A, B, C> 0. If b021 ,
b012 - y1, b201, b102 - y2 , b210, b120  -y3 and b111  -x0
(where yi, x0 > 0) such that y1 is the unique solution of
(3), y2 is the unique solution of (4), y3 is the unique
solution of (5) and x0 is given by (12) with y0 =
max(y1, y2, y3), then P(u, v, w)  0 for all u, v, w  0,
u + v + w = 1.
We note that in practice if any of the values of A,
B or C are zero then x0 and y0 are both assigned the
value zero for that triangle.

3. Construction of positivity preserving
interpolating surface
We want to construct a C1 positivity-preserving
functional surface F(x,y) which interpolates a given
scattered data, (xi, yi ,zi ), i=1,2,…,N, where zi > 0. The
surface comprises cubic Bézier triangular patches, each
of which is guaranteed to remain positive. The
construction process follows the steps in [2] and [10]
which consists of the following:
1. Triangulate the domain data (xi, yi),
i=1,2,…,N.
2. Initialise partial derivatives at each data point,
then modify them (if necessary) to be
consistent with the positivity constraints
imposed on the Bezier ordinates.
3. Generate the final surface.
We use Delaunay triangulation [3] to triangulate
the convex hull of the data points. An estimation of the
first order partial derivative of F with respect to x and
y is obtained using the method proposed in [5]. Let
Vi=(xi, yi), i=1, 2, 3 be the vertices of a triangle, such
that F(Vi)= zi, and the first partial derivatives, Fx(Vi)
and Fy(Vi). For each triangular patch P as in (1), the
derivative along the edge ejk joining (xj, yj) to (xk, yk) is
given by
wP
wF
wF
( xk  x j )
.
 ( yk  y j )
we jk
wx
wy
From the given data together with the estimated
derivatives at all the (xi,yi), all the Bézier ordinates brst
except b111 are determined. For example, we have:
1 wF
b300 = F(V1),
b210 F (V1 ) 
(V1 ) and
3 we12
1 wF
the
initial
b201 F (V1 ) 
(V1 ). However,
3 we31
estimate for each edge ordinate may not satisfy the
positivity conditions for P, in view of the Proposition,
we need these Bézier ordinates to fulfill b021, b012  -y1,

b201, b102 - y2, b210, b120  -y3. If it does not, the
magnitudes of Fx, Fy at the vertices need to be reduced
so that the conditions are satisfied. The modification of
these partial derivatives at a vertex Vi, is achieved by
multiplying each derivative at that vertex, by a scaling
factor 0 < Ȗi < 1, i = 1, 2, 3. The smallest value of Ȗi is
obtained by considering all triangles that meet at vertex
Vi, which satisfies the positivity conditions of all the
triangles. For example, let Ti, i = 1, …, k be the
triangles of the triangulation which have O as a vertex
(see Figure 3 , where k = 6).

Figure 3. Triangles in the triangulation with the

Consider the triangle T1 and the lower bound of
Bézier ordinates adjacent to O on the edge OA and OB
as follows:
Case 1. If O is vertex V1, the lower bound of Bézier
ordinates adjacent to O on edge OA is -y3 and on OB is
-y2.
Case 2. If O is vertex V2, the lower bound of Bézier
ordinates adjacent to O on edge OA is -y1 and on OB is
-y3.
Case 3. If O is vertex V3, the lower bound of Bézier
ordinates adjacent to O on edge OA is -y1 and on OB is
-y2.
It suffices to just consider Case 1 as the other two
cases can be dealt with in a similar manner. Let the
derivatives at O along OA and OB be denoted by
wF
wF

for the rest of triangles of the triangulation (as in
Figure 3) by using the same argument above. Finally,
in order that all the Bézier ordinates adjacent to O
fulfill the positivity preserving conditions stated in the
Proposition, let Ȗ1 = min{ J T1 , J T2 , . . ., J T k } . If Ȗ1 <
1, we redefine Fx and Fy at point O respectively as Ȗ1
times the corresponding initial values. By using the

derivatives, (

(b201)j =

subscript j represents quantities corresponding to
triangle j. Having adjusted these derivatives, if
necessary, the Bézier ordinates are recalculated using
the formulae above. The above process is repeated at
all the nodes, Vi. For each triangle, the inner Bézier
ordinate b111, remains to be calculated, in such a way to
guarantee preservation of positivity and to ensure C1
continuity across patch boundaries. Let T1 and T2 be
two adjacent cubic Bézier triangular patches with a
common boundary curve (see Figure 4). C1 continuity
conditions between two adjacent patches are given by
(13)
c102 = Pb120 + Pb030 + Pb021
c111 = Pb111+ Pb021 + Pb012
(14)
c120 = Pb102+ Pb012 + Pb003
(15)
where (P P P is the barycentric coordinates of W3
with respect to triangle T1. (13) and (15) are
automatically satisfied since the Bézier ordinates b201,
b102, b012, b021, b120, and b210 have already been
obtained.
We shall use similar method as in [6] to determine
i
initial value of inner Bézier ordinate, b111
which is C1
across the boundary ei ,i = 1, 2, 3 where ei is the edge
of the triangle opposite vertex Vi. Local schemes Pi is

An initial estimate of the inner Bézier ordinates
given by (16), (17) and (18) in each triangle may not
satisfy the positivity conditions of P(u, v, w) as stated
in the Proposition i.e. b111  -x0. For example, when e1
is a common edge to two triangles as in Figure 3, and
1
1
the initial value b111
or c111
is less than –x0, then these
1
ordinates are modified together to ensure that b111
,
1
 -x0, and C1 continuity condition along the
c111
common boundary curve between two adjacent patches
given by (14) is satisfied. When e1 is on the boundary
1
1
is
of the domain, and b111
is less than -x0 then b111
2
3
reset to be equal to x0. The ordinates b111
and b111
of
P2 and P3 are adjusted accordingly by using a similar
approach (see [2] for further detail).
The interpolating surface P on the triangle T is
then defined as a convex combination of all the local
schemes so that the sufficient conditions on all sides of
the triangles are satisfied, i.e.
P(u,v,w) = c1P1(u,v,w) + c2P2(u,v,w) + c3P3(u,v,w)

Figure 5 shows the surface without imposing the
positivity conditions and can be seen clearly that the
surface actually falls below the xy-plane. When the
positivity conditions are imposed, the interpolating
surface remains positive as shown in Figure 6.
The second example is the function
2

g(x,y) = (x2- 1) ( y2-1)2 , (x,y)  [-1.4,1.4]x[-1.4,1.4]
taken from [7]. We construct the interpolating suface
using 63 data points from this function. The surface
with no positivity conditions imposed is shown in
Figure 7 and with positivity conditions imposed is
given in Figure 8. Again, part of the surface in Figure 7
is below the xy-plane. After positivity conditions are
imposed, the resulting surface remains positive.

5. Conclusions
In this study, we have considered the generation of
non-parametric surfaces that interpolate positive
scattered data. We imposed very general positivity
conditions on Bézier ordinates which now could be
adjusted independently while still ensuring positivity
of the interpolating surface as compared to the results
in [2] and [10] using cubic triangular patch. This gives
more flexibility to the construction of the interpolating
surfaces.
