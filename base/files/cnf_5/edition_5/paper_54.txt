Abstract

order partial differential equations (PDEs) for surface
blending and present an approximate algorithm for the
resolution of the PDEs. We investigate how different
orders of partial differential equations influence the
continuities of blending surfaces.

1. Introduction
Surface blending has a wide range of applications in
computer aided design, computer animation and other
industries. It has attracted a lot of research attention.
Rossignac and Requicha defined the rolling-ball
blending method in terms of offset solids and
approximated blending surfaces and their intersecting
curves by use of piecewise circular curves [1].
Middledich and Sears proposed a technique which is
suitable for blend definition and profile control. With
such a technique, determining the blending surface with
this method relies on finding a conic tangential to two
straight lines that define a plane [2]. Hoffmann and
Hopcroft proposed the formulation for blending two or
three primary surfaces and named this technique the
potential method [3]. Later on, they developed the
projective potential method [4]. Bloor and Wilson
introduced the fourth order partial differential equation
into surface blending [5]. Rockwood proposed a method
to blend implicit surfaces and called it the displacement
method [6]. For implicit surfaces, Warren introduced a
new definition of geometric continuity and presented
some new methods to blend several primary surfaces
simultaneously [7]. In addition to the application in
blending implicit surfaces, the rolling ball method also
finds a wide range of applications in blending parametric
surfaces. Normally, there are two kinds of rolling-ball
blends: constant-radius blends and variable-radius
blends. By sweeping rational quadratic (conic section)
curves, Choi and Ju constructed constant-radius rollingball (edge) blends which can be used to blend any
rectangular parametric surface patches with smooth

offset surfaces whose intersections can be well defined
[8]. Later, Kosters extended the potential method to
blend implicitly defined surfaces, includes blending an
arbitrary number of surfaces to form a convex corner,
blending surfaces for all cases where three surfaces meet
transversely, and blending for a very general class of
corners [9]. He further extended the potential method to
blends of arbitrary continuities consisting of piecewise
algebraic surfaces of low degree [10]. Sanglikar et al.
employed differential geometry to formulate equations
for blending parametric surfaces and gave closed form
analytic solutions for most of the surfaces used in current
solid modellers [11]. Cheng et al. proposed a finite
difference method to solve fourth order partial
differential equations and applied the solution in surface
blending of quadric surfaces [12]. Ohkura and Kakazu
described a generalized method for the blending of three
primary surfaces which yields the formulae for both
convex and concave combinations. They also presented
the projective potential method to produce a convex
combination of three surfaces [13]. Based on the
determination of intersection of two offset surfaces using
only the first-order derivatives of the progenitors,
Barnhill et al. developed a method for blending two
primary parametric surfaces [14]. Vida et al. presented a
comprehensive review of blending between parametric
surfaces, discussed the applicability and efficiency of
parametric techniques for general blending situations,
and pointed out open questions for future research in
surface blending [15]. Defining the blending surface as a
collection of intersection curves of correlated pairs of
surfaces, Hartmann proposed a method to blend an
implicit surface with a parametric surface which can
achieve G2-continuous transitions from the blending
surface to primary surfaces by introducing a simple
additional condition [16]. Chuang et al. used the derived
spine curve and linkage curves to compute a parametric
form of the variable-radius spherical and circular blends
and investigated the variable-radius rolling-ball blending
methods [17]. They translated geometric constraints
specifying the variable radius into a non-linear system
that represents the spine curve exactly for solving the
difficulty in specifying the radius and tracing the spine
curve [18]. Chunag and Lien also proposed an exact
formulation which represents the blending in a high
dimensional space as the swept surface of the

intersection between the offsets of the base surfaces
whose the radii satisfy a specific one-parameter curve,
and another complex formulation defining the blend as
the sweeping surface of the intersection between offsets
of base surfaces whose radii satisfy a specific twoparameter surface [19]. Li and Li and Chang developed
boundary penalty finite element methods to solve partial
differential equations and applied it in surface blending
[20-22]. On the basis of the theory of envelopes and
discriminant sets, LukÃ¡cs analyzed variable radius rolling
ball (VRRB) blend surfaces which are envelopes of one
parameter families of varying radius balls and usually G1
continuous but often only piecewise curvature
continuous [23]. Hartmann investigated a numerical
implicitization for both parametric surfaces and many
other surfaces of practical use which have no standard
(parametric or implicit) representations in a uniform way
as implicit surfaces [24]. KÃ³s and colleagues examined
the methods for recovering constant radius rolling-ball
blends in reverse engineering [25]. Chen et al. gave a
scheme to construct a piecewise algebraic surface which
blends the given surfaces along the intersection curves of
the given surfaces and their corresponding auxiliary
planes [26]. You et al. discussed a fast resolution method
for fourth order partial differential equations and applied
it in blends of parametric surfaces [27]. Based on the
geometric information of the given boundary curves,
Chang and Yang used a boundary-blending method
achieve unidirectional 2D parametrization and extended
it to bi-directional parametrization via superposition to
include both boundary pairs which leads to reasonable
smooth blending of the boundaries [28]. Foufou and
Garnier discussed how to determine principal circles
tangent to both quadrics being blended, proposed a novel
method to define G1 Dupin cyclide blends between
quadric primitives [29]. Han and Wu introduced the
parametrization of implicit blending surfaces and
investigated the subdivision scheme of the kth-degree
NURBS curve, and presented the algorithm of
subdivision scheme for the implicit algebraic surfaces
[30]. Song et al. developed a method to created n-sided
(n = 3, 5, 6) G2 blending surfaces with the exception of
the 3-sided blending surface being C0 continuous at the
three vertexes and the 5-sided blending surface being C0
continuous at a vertex [31].
In this paper, we will introduce the resolution of
second order partial differential equations and examine
how different orders of partial differential equations
affect the smoothness at the transition curves between
the blending surface and the primary surfaces
represented in a parametric form.

2. Blending models with different orders of
partial differential orders
Partial differential equations have been widely
applied in surface blending. It is well known that a
second order partial differential equation can only ensure
the positional continuity. A fourth order partial
differential equation can guarantee both positional and

tangential continuities and a sixth order partial
differential equation has a capacity to satisfy up to
curvature continuities. However, the higher the order of
the partial differential equation, the more difficult and
inefficient it is to solve the equation. Mixed order partial
differential equations can reduce the computational cost.
A combination of two second and one fourth order
partial differential equations have been applied in surface
blending by Bloor and Wilson [5].
In the following, we will present a solution to a
second order partial differential equation subject to
blending boundary conditions, and combine the second
and fourth order, second and sixth order, and fourth and
sixth order partial differential equations as well as the
second, fourth and sixth order partial differential
equations to create blending surfaces of the same
blending task. We will also examine the effects of these
partial differential equations on blending surfaces.
Mathematically, surface blending with up to sixth
order partial differential equation can be defined below.
For surface blending with second order partial
differential equations, the resolution equations and
blending boundary conditions are

By introduction of mixed order blends, three
combinations of different orders of partial differential
equations up to the sixth order exist. Usually, the x and y
components are taken to be a lower order and the z
component is set to a higher order. The first combination

3. Resolution of PDE based blending
problems
The blending problems described by Eq. (1) to (6)
can be summarized into the separate resolution of
second, fourth and sixth order partial differential
equations subject to corresponding blending boundary
conditions.
Similar to the treatment in [32, 33], the functions of
boundary curves, tangents and curvatures can be divided
into some independent basic functions. Taking the x

In order to minimize the error of partial differential
equation (1), some collocation points are chosen and the
square sum of the error function at these collocation
points is calculated. Its differentiation with respect to
the unknown constants p jm (m 2,3,4, M xj ) produces
the following linear algebraic equations

For the fourth and sixth order partial differential
equations, the position function is still taken to be (8).
With the similar treatment, the resultant linear algebraic
equations can be obtained and have the same form as
(12).
Solving Eq. (12), the x component is determined.
Carrying out the same operation, both y and z
components can be determined. Then, these position
functions are used to generate blending surfaces.

4. Effects on blending surfaces
In this section, we will use some examples to study
how different orders of partial differential equations
affect the continuities of blending surfaces. The first
example is to blend the frustum of an irregular cone with
an elliptic cylinder. The boundary conditions up to
curvature continuities for this blending problem can be
written as

With the above methods, the blending surface from
Eq. (1) to (6) is given in Figure 1, respectively.
It can be seen from these figures that the second
order partial differential equations can only create
blending surface with positional continuity. Keeping
partial differential equation for x and y components to be
the second order and changing the partial differential
equation for the z component to a fourth order do not
improve the continuity between the blending surface and
primary surfaces. Even worse, a higher order partial
differential equation for the z component appears to
bring in poorer results at the boundary curves. This can
be observed from the blending surface in Figure 1c
which is produced by the combination between 2 second
and one sixth order partial differential equations.
However, when all the partial differential equations
become the fourth order, the smooth transition from the
blending surface to primary surfaces is created. This is
because both positional and tangential continuities at
boundary curves are achieved.
Further changing all the partial differential equations
to the sixth order, the blending surface in Figure 1e was
obtained. It is smoother than that in Figure 1d because of
the introduction of curvature continuity.
For the mixed order blends, when the lowest order
of partial differential equations is larger than 4, higher
order partial differential equation for the z component
leads to better continuity. This argument is supported by
the observation of Figures 1d and 1e.

equations. However, although both blends in Figure 1a
and Figure 2a employed the second order partial
differential equations, the continuity in Figure 2a is
better than that in Figure 1a. This suggests that for some
blending tasks, i.e., when the tangential information of
the blending surfaces defined by Eq. (1) at the boundary
curves is close to that of primary surfaces, the second
order partial differential equations can create visible
smoothness between the blending surface and primary
surfaces.

5. Conclusions
Different orders of partial differential equations
determine the continuity between the blending surface
and primary surfaces. In this paper, we investigate this
issue.
We discussed the mathematical models of the
surface blending with different orders and mixed orders
of partial differential equations and the resolution of the
second order partial differential equations subject to
blending boundary conditions.
The order of partial differential equations has a
strong influence on the continuity of blending surfaces.
For general cases, the second order partial differential
equations cannot achieve satisfactory smoothness
between the blending surface and primary surfaces. For
such a situation, the smoothness cannot be improved by
mixed order blends. In contrast, when the order of partial
differential equations is not less than 4, the introduction
of higher order partial differential equation for one
position component is helpful for a smoother transition
from the blending surface to primary surfaces.

In the interest of space, here we only consider the
blending surfaces from the second and sixth order partial
differential equations, respectively. Using the above
methods, the blending surface from the second order
partial differential equations was shown in Fig. 2a and
that by the sixth order partial differential equations was
depicted in Figure 2b.
Once again, the images in Figures 2a and 2b indicate
that the sixth order partial differential equations generate
smoother transition between the blending surface and
primary surfaces than the second order partial differential
