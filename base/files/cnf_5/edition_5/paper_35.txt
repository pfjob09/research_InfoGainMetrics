characteristics. And different quantum schemes are
adopted according to man eye’s different sensitivity to
different sub-band. Because of wavelet’s good
frequency characteristics, better compressibility can be
gained compared with traditional compressing
methods. Recently, wavelet transformation’s spatial
compressing characteristics and coefficients’ spatial
auto-similarity have been adopted especially Shaprio’s
zero-tree scheme[6]. The scheme adopted full-fresh
zerotree data structure method to characterize wavelet
coefficients’ spatial auto-similarity. The method
achieves distinct reconstructed image quality with
increased compressibility. In this document, an
improved method based on zerotree method is pointed
out. Based on this, image perfect reconstructed effect
is gained.

2 Image Compression System Realization
Based on Zerotree Method
In fig.1 image compressing system based on
zerotree method is described. Original image is carried
to zerotree encoder after wavelet transformation. After
zerotree encoder and arithmetic encoder ,output code
stream is generated.

zerotree method
Code stream generated by zerotree encoder has
multi-code rate characteristics, whose uniqueness lies
in its description of significant coefficients’ position
information. Zerotree method coding steps can be
described as follows
Selects first grade quantizer’s step and makes
current quantum threshold value equal to step size
Using current threshold value compare zerotree
wavelet coefficients which can not be detected
significance and do not belong to current threshold
value. Four code words are generated and carried to
arithmetic encoder Positive Negative zero-tree root
isolated zero.
The formerly detected significant coefficients
increase one-bit accuracy according to next grade’s
quantum step size and are carried to arithmetic encoder

The formerly detected significant coefficients are
orderly sequenced according to its reconstructed
amplitudes. And larger coefficients obtain priority
encoding at later encoder stage.
make current value halve and return
In arithmetic encoder, if designated code rate is
reached, encoder will be terminated.

3. Improved Scheme
Firstly, hybrid self-adapting arithmetic encoder is
used compared with Shaprio’s single base encoder.
The method considers fully the same patternal data’s
probability relation at different quantum level. Using
the same paternal data probability model at former
quantum level, it predicts probability model at next
quantum level so that coding efficiency is increased.
Secondly, rejecting significant coefficients’
sequence according to their amplitudes. Through Table
3, when encoded in low encode rate, zerotree method
has no influence whether having sequential coefficient
or not. When compressing rate is low, SNR increase is
also little. By image subjective quality, the increase is
insensitive to man’s eyes. Rejecting stream encryption
has good characteristics and encryption stream is
processed according to wavelet transformation from
higher decomposition to lower decomposition. Thus
the stream can be divided at different decomposition
level, so that image multi-resolution can be done at
coding end according to actual application
requirement.

4. Simulation Result
In coding system, based on Anitni9/7 filter wavelet
base, the original image is six- level wavelet
decomposed.
