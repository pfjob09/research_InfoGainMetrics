ABSTRACT
In tourism industry, reservation or booking through the
Internet is now so common; it is becoming the practice
among the big or small industry players. However,
what is missing and lacking is the concept of virtual
imaging that represent the ongoing transaction. For
this paper, the focus is visualizing real time reservation
for an island-based vacation area. Up to now, most of
the information is conveyed to the customers through
plain boring old text or through verbal explanation
given by service provider through phone or emailing
system. Major frustration is caused by not knowing the
exact location of the reserved facility within the
particular area. So, this paper will discuss in detail the
weakness of current reservation process that can be
avoided by applying an improved multimedia
management
technology
through
graphics
visualization technique.

Reality. However, image visualization technique that is
based on real-time transaction has not been popularly
used.

2. Current stage of IT in tourism industry
Tourism industry has been revolutionized from three
different stages. The first stage was purely traditional
where tourist comes or visits the attractive area, checks
the availability of the facilities and finally made the
booking. The second stage was introduced when
communication infrastructure is available. Phone call
or faxing were the best method for finding the
availability before actual visit was made. Lastly, the
third stage as today, online reservation is made through
the Internet and most of the time; the information is
updated in real time where users are instantly notified.

1. Introduction
Most countries in the world are involved and
engaged in tourism industry, which attracts both local
and international visitors. In Malaysia alone, number of
visitors from overseas has gradually increased from
10,576,915 in year 2003 to 15,703,406 in year 2004
[1] resulting an increase in total income of Malaysia
over the same period of time.The main international
visitors are from Singapore, United Kingdom and
Australia and tourism industry is regarded as the
second largest industry in Malaysia after
manufacturing. Even some countries in the world
become well known just because of the popularity of
its tourist spots such as Bahamas, Hawaii and Phuket.
The huge volume of request from the tourism industry
has created competition among various tourist
providers that Information Technology (IT) has
become as one of the most important tools. Graphics
and multimedia application has been widely applied
such as in 3D panoramic view or even in Virtual

However, one of the most common problems faced
by many customers is that they are not able to pick the
exact facility within a specified location. Customers
are coming from many backgrounds and have different
preferences from one to another. Based on the
preferences, location is one of the most important
criteria, which are important for making a correct
decision. As shown in Figure 1 of Ingleside Resort, the

information about the location of each facility will help
the customers to set the priority when doing the
booking. For any customers who enjoy fishing, they
will try to locate the fishing location and the nearest
accommodation for them to stay. The same thing goes
for customers with small kids; they would prefer a
room or accommodation near to swimming pool or
playground. There are many other facilities like pub
and karaoke center which is attractive to certain group
of people. The complication faced by customers during
the online reservation may lead to an argument or
dissatisfaction. So, the integration of visualization and
database can be turning points where now customers
can virtual see the exact location and the availability of
the facility before making any decision. What is
expected as end result is win-win situation to both
customers and service provider.
The traditional method of booking or reserving
accommodation is done in text and table. The sample
of traditional system is shown in Figure 2.

check and I get back to you”, “hold on”, “person in
charge is not available” , “ please leave a message..
we will get back to you” can now be eliminated.
Frustration affecting both side causes by unnecessary
phone call should be avoided toward better services.

What is shown in the report is only the quantity of

information such as types of room and its price based
on the date queried as shown in Figure 3,4 and 5 [3].
While it is true, customers may request for detail by
asking the helpdesk or customer center, but the
friendliness and professionalism of the staff are not
always there as expected. And, no matter how detail
the explanation is given, it is very difficult for the
customers to imagine the location and distance
between all the facilities. In any condition, it is a lot
better when images or pictures are provided with a
proper scale. Through this visualization technique,
time spends by customer and service provider on the
phone can be reduced or eliminated. What is important
is that the information is available all the time and can
be accessed from anywhere. Remarks such “let me

Some of the effort has been made to cater to these
needs. Through the concept of virtual reality, virtual
tour of the site is now available. Virtual Reality
Modeling Language (VRML) and panoramic tools are
among common technologies used for that purpose.
360 degrees panoramic view is obtained by scanning
scenes around through a slit when a camera rotates,
that is actually taking one pixel line in each image
frame and collecting consecutive lines along the time.
The use of panoramic image has been extended from
robot scene recognition to environment monitoring and
multimedia visualization that realizes virtual tourism.
Figure 6 is an example of stitched photos for making
the panoramic view [4].
As described by the
panoramic technology, images or view are not being
integrated with database. So, real time information
retrieved from database is not shown to the end user.

Figure 6: Sample of Panoramic View
However, this concept is still not good enough.
There are many cases where customers are not happy
or surprised upon arriving at the tourist site. Comments
and grudges such as the unattractive view from the
room given or the far distance of the room from most
of the other important facilities (such as the swimming
pool or the fishing area) are common. They need more
information than just the condition or the ‘grand and
attractive view’ of the facilities or accommodation they
want to book. Customers would also prefer to visualize
the ‘view’ of the whole area such as the exact location
of each requested facility and how it blends with its
overall surrounding.
As we all agree, a picture is capable of conveying
thousand of (interpreted) information. A clear and
definite explanation can only be given when image
visualization technique is used compared to traditional
verbal or text based explanation. For this proposed
system, a concept of bird view is good enough for
image visualization purposes. Since the application is
accessed through the Internet, speed factor must be
taken into consideration. Customers interests of
accessing or reserving through internet is very much
depends on the accessing speed. Too much of images
and graphics will increase Internet loading time. For
that reason, 2D images are used as they are much more
practical compared to 3D images.

3. Proposed Visualization System
Visualization is a graphical representation of
information, with the goal of providing the viewer with
a qualitative understanding of the information content
[5]. It is suggested that a picture is worth a thousand
words. From this statement one might gain the
impression that visualization can produce a stunning
picture, which explains a lot of information that can be
absorbed by the viewer. Therefore graphical
representation is necessary in order to get a better
interpretation and understanding of the produced data.
The visualization term refers to a process of converting
a set of data into a visual format, which is much easier
to be read and understood. The aim of visualization is
to use any form of graphics representation in order to
increase the understanding of data or a system. The
basic concept of visualization has been introduced long
time ago. However, active research for modern
visualization has only started in 1987 [6].
In the tourism industry, which involved booking or
reservation of the facilities (mostly accommodation
such as chalet), visualization is very much practical but
not heavily explored. Information, which is stored in
the database, is purely reflected to the end user in text
mode. Any query about the facilities will be
entertained through voice communication or email
resulting in extra manpower to execute those activities.
However, through visualization, some of this tedious
and resource consuming activity can be eliminated or
reduced by providing real-time visual information to
users in order to help them in making certain decision.
The system proposed is targeted for island-based
resort area where the whole resort can be visualized as
detail as possible. However, it is expected that the
system can be improved to be used in any other type of
tourist site. What is so unique about this system is that
the customers are able to see the entire area that
adequately represents the size and the location of the
facilities. The availability of the accommodation
namely chalet, house or campsite is not shown in text
but represented by graphical images of the area. The
status of each preferred accommodations is linked with
database where the transactions are stored. So, when a
request is made, the general or specific availability
status of the accommodation is shown using different
color or shade.
The system could also prevent many uneasy
situations faced by the customers once they arrived at
the site. Among common request is changing of room
or location. If the information is available in hand

while doing the booking or reservation, then the whole
new transaction can be avoided. The valuable time
saved is very important for both customers and service
provider. At the end, once there is no complaint or
argument, then rating given by the customers to resort
will surely be higher. This is very important as good or
high rating contributes to higher income for the
industry.
As mentioned in the introduction section, the
customers would be provided with real time
information on-hand, that no conversation is required
between the customers and the service provider. Any
unnecessary delay can be avoided because decision is
all made by the individual customer without any
interference by the service provider. The real time
graphical information will be a perfect guidance, and
basically service provider (chalet owner) is not
involved in persuading or encouraging the customer
before any final decision is made. As mention before,
this concept will avoid any negative element such as
argument between the two parties involved. The real
time and interactive information are no longer
represented by plain text but through graphical
visualization that differentiate the status of requested
accommodation. For both parties, this is an extra
benefit gained from the system. Back to old reservation
method, and without visualization, miscommunication
or wrong information is the common factor lead to a
wrong decision.

A combination of various colors or shades that
serves as the indicator to the customers will help them
towards making better decision. This indicator
represents the availability (in percentage) of each
accommodation based on the date requested. In the
proposed system, there are three available shades to
represent
the
availability
status
of
the
accommodations:




White
indicating
that
a
particular
accommodation is between 100% and 90%
available for the requested period.
Gray
indicating
that
a
particular
accommodation is between 90% and 10%
available for the requested period.
Black
indicating
that
a
particular
accommodation is between 10% and 0%
available for the requested period. In another
word, black shade means that there is very
small possibility that an accommodation is
free for booking.

Customers will then have the first layer of
information in making their decision as which
particular accommodation (chalet) that they are
interested in based on the availability status. An
example is shown in Figure 6.

Date From 08/04/06 to 11/04/06

During the development, multiple layer technique
from PhotoShop is applied representing the three
different conditions of the chalets which are available,
partially available and not available. The correct layer
will be displayed depending on range of requested date
keyed in by users. For real time and interactive web
application, the Active Server Pages (ASP) technology
with VBScript is fully applied. For storage and
retrieval purposes, Microsoft Access database is used.
However, other technology such as PHP, Cold Fusion
and many other databases such as Oracle and MySql
are also applicable.
The only different is that, images are automatically
created representing the result of queries or transaction
performed by the customers. The overall location for
each accommodation and facilities available, together
with its surrounding environment is shown to the
customers. The customers are now able to book a
particular accommodation (such as chalet), that is
located near to the facilities closely match to their
interest.

Besides color and shades, mouse over technique is
used to list down the detail of availability status of an
accommodation (chalet) that has been selected. Based
on the duration provided, the system will display a
table listing daily availability status of the selected
accommodation as shown in Figure 7. The availability
status for that particular accommodation for two days
before and two days after the requested period will also
be displayed by the system, anticipating to any changes
that might be made by the users. Apart from the table,
indication of the distance between the selected
accommodations with every facility is also provided.

area. It is reasonable to conclude that, with slight
modification, the same application is also suitable to be
used for reservation for accommodation in high-rise
building such as multi-storey hotel. Location such as
near to an elevator, escalator, fire door and scenic view
can be a consideration factor when visitors are booking
a room at multi level high or high sky hotel or
apartment. For full exploitation of real-time image
visualization technology, networking is among the
issues that need to be resolved. Continues updating the
images that reflect the content of the database, has
some impact to the performance of the web
application. However, this should not be an obstacle
toward utilizing the technique for the benefit of
mankind in general.

The completed system was demonstrated to the
representative of Malaysian Tourism Industry (MTI)
where positive comments were given. This visual
reservation can be very useful for the tourist where a
preferred decision can be made. However, some
disadvantages to the resort owner were also mentioned
by MTI representative that some chalets might be left
empty due to the distance factor. This small
disadvantage can be overcome by differentiating the
rental rate based on the location of the facilities.
