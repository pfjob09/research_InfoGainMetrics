Subdivision, Total Positivity and Causality
Professor Tim Goodman
Dundee University, UK

We consider subdivision schemes which have good shape properties for design purposes because the resulting bases
are totally positive. This happens when the symbol of the corresponding refinement equation has all its roots in the
left half-plane, and includes the case of uniform B-splines. We then show that when a corresponding refinable
function is used as the kernel of a smoothing operator, then this operator has a version of the `causality property',
i.e. the smoothed signal cannot increase its number of zero crossings as the scale of the kernel increases. This
property is possessed by the Gaussian kernel, as has been much studied in connection with computer vision, and we
examine how the above smoothing operators approach asymptotically the operator with Gaussian kernel.

in mathematics from respectively St. John's College Cambridge, Warwick University and Sussex University, all
UK. His research interests are in approximation theory, particularly spline functions, and applications to areas such
as wavelets and computer aided design.
