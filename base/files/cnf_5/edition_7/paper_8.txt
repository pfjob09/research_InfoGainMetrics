Abstract
We obtain a G2 fair curve by adding a spiral segment
to one end of an existing curve. The added segments are
cubic and Pythagorean hodograph quintic spirals. We derive the more explicit reachable regions for the end points
of the added spirals. Spiral segments are useful in the design of fair curves. The advantage of our technique is its
more ﬂexible control of the curvature and inﬂection points
of a designed curve.

1 Introduction
Spirals have several advantages of containing neither inﬂection points, singularities nor curvature extrema. Such
curves are useful in the design of fair curves [3, 4, 5, 6] and
transitions [2, 8, 9]. Walton & Meek [7] considered a G2
curve design with spiral segments. The object of this paper is to examine their methods and obtain larger reachable
regions for the end points of cubic and Pythagorean hodograph (PH) quintic spiral segments starting from the origin.
The advantage of our technique is its control of the curvature and inﬂection points of a designed curve. The beneﬁt
of using such curves in the design of surfaces, in particular
surfaces of revolution and swept surfaces, is the control of
unwanted ﬂat spots and undulations. The objectives of this
paper are
• To simplify and complete the analysis of Walton &
Meek [7].
• To achieve better ﬂexibility than any previous method
by developing more explicit reachable regions for the
end points of spiral segments.
• To compare reachable regions for the end points between cubic and PH quintic spiral segments.
The added segment passes through the origin and is constrained by its beginning unit tangent vector (1, 0) and its

beginning curvature. We treat four cases. The added spiral
segments may
1. start at an inﬂection point and continue with a curvature of increasing magnitude up to a given noninﬂection point with a radius of curvature, r, with a
given ending unit tangent vector (cos θ, sin θ).
2. start at a non-inﬂection point with a given radius of
curvature, r, and continue with a curvature of decreasing magnitude up to an inﬂection point with a given
ending unit tangent vector (cos θ, sin θ).
3. start at a non-inﬂection point with a given radius of
curvature, r, and continue with a curvature of increasing magnitude up to a given non-inﬂection point.
4. start at a non-inﬂection point with a given radius of
curvature, r, and continue with a curvature of decreasing magnitude up to a given non-inﬂection point.
Sections 2 and 3 consider the curve z(t)(=
(x(t), y(t)), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 in cubic and PH quintic added spiral
segments, respectively, and obtain the reachable regions for
(ξ, η)(= z(1)/r). Its signed curvature κ(t) is given by:
κ(t) =

z (t) × z (t)

2 Cubic spiral
Cubic spiral transition from line to circle (i.e., monotone
increasing curvature) was developed in [1]. Here we will
discuss this and some other spiral segments for different
cases.

proved that the Walton schemes for cubic and PH quintic are
special cases of our more ﬂexible schemes. We compared
our results with [7]. Meek and Walton’s reachable regions
are shown as black discs in Figure 3 and area bounded by
thin curves and ξ-axes in Figure 4. These regions are very
small as compared to our case. Our scheme is more ﬂexible than any previous scheme and hence more suitable for
many practical applications.

Cases 3, 4: A change in θ gives the reachable regions for
cases 3 and 4 in Figure 4 where a heavy dotted region corresponds to case 3 and all dotted region (light and heavy)

4 Practical Examples and Conclusion
A vase proﬁle has been shown in Figure 5(a) using the
Walton scheme. In this ﬁgure, segments are not connected
with each other because the value of m is ﬁxed in the Walton scheme which is 1. Our scheme has solved this problem
by using shape parameter value m = 0.71 with same vase
proﬁle data. Result is shown in Figure 5(b) where all segments are properly connected.
Outlines in Figures 6(a,c-f) are composed from cubic
B´ezier spiral segments, whereas, Figure 6(b) uses more
ﬂexible PH quintic spiral segments. Finally, curves in Figure 6 are used for surface of revolution shown in Figure 7.
PH quintic spiral segments are more ﬂexible than cubic spiral segments and hence more useful in the design
of objects. In addition to the ability of designing ﬂexible
fair curves, the use of PH spiral segments ensures that such
curves have rational offsets and polynomial expressions for
arc-length. Cubic spiral segments are computationally simpler. They are suitable for the design of objects that do not
require a high degree of ﬂexibility, and when the advantages
of using PH curves are not of primary importance.
We presented a very simple and ﬂexible scheme offering more degree of freedom. To guarantee the absence of
interior curvature extremum (i.e., spiral segment) in transition curves, the user can select any value of parameter m
greater than 0.577 for cubic and 0.707 for PH quintic. On
the other hand it must be 1 in the Walton [7] scheme. We
