Abstract
Geometric modeling involving uncertainty of data is
the major problem in CAGD. By using the theory of
fuzzy set and its properties, the issues of uncertainty
can be solved through the concept of fuzzy numbers. In
this paper we apply fuzzy numbers as uncertainty data
and defined a new kind of fuzzy control points. With
this type of points we then introduced a fuzzy Bezier
curve and fuzzy B-spline. By these definitions, we
construct a curve of such fuzzy spline and given an
example of fuzzy Bezier curve and fuzzy B-spline in the
context of CAGD at the end of this concept papers.

1. Introduction
The issue of uncertainty is quite major problem in
modeling. Uncertainty data means incomplete
knowledge of data structure. Data which are collected
may be affected by noise, uncertainty and
approximation. These kinds of data can be modeled by
using fuzzy modeling [4, 5, 7, 8].
In this concept paper we are using the fuzzy set
(fuzzy number) and its properties in order to describe
the uncertainty parts (fuzzy parts) of the data. This
fuzzy number will represent three mains part of data
structure: crisp part, left-hand part and right-hand part.
With one fuzzy number we considered as one points of
uncertainty data (fuzzy data).
The model will be
interpolated or approximated the main three of our
data.
In Geometrical Modeling, control points are
display the major rule in processing and produced a
smooth curve for design. By using Zadeh‚Äôs fuzzy set
theory and their properties, we define fuzzy control
points through fuzzy number. The problem uncertain
data (fuzzy data) can be modeled by using left and
right fuzzy control points. Based on fuzzy logic and its
application, the curve and surface can be designed
their fuzzy model in the context of CAGD. By

constructing fuzzy spline model, the problems of
uncertainty (fuzzy) and complex data and shape can
described in more precise.
In Computer Aided Geometric Design or Geometric
Modeling, we provide a set of points in the space to
produce a certain type of curve and surface, and it
often occurs that points interpolation are not sets of
real number but ranges of qualitative. These set of
points are given incomplete knowledge that is
characterized whether or not that set of points really
belong to their domain of definition. These data we
consider as uncertainty or fuzzy data, data which will
accompany with their degree of truth which take the
value from 0 to 1. This uncertainty data can be
modeled using fuzzy set theory.
In this paper we introduced the basic concept of
geometric modeling using fuzzy set theory introduced
by L.A. Zadeh in 1965 [13]. The basic ideal or method
of constructing fuzzy spline and fuzzy surface from a
set of fuzzy control points are introduced. This fuzzy
spline or fuzzy curve that consistent and maintain the
underlying their crisp smoothness. This technique, all
uncertainty data in the form of fuzzy number which
means that each of crisp control points are consist of
right fuzzy control points and left fuzzy control points.
It has a certain degree of belonging to original control
points which we called crisp control points. This
means that its membership function are left and right
continuous in closed bounded interval at each of ƒÆvalue. We use this set of fuzzy control points in order
to construct the model of various fuzzy curve and can
be extended to fuzzy surface such as fuzzy parametric
(non-parametric) spline, fuzzy Bezier curve and
surface, and fuzzy B-spline. For their smoothness we
use the concept which introduced in [2] rather then
utilize fuzzy kriging method [8, 9]. For constructing a
fuzzy model, we have chosen a certain numbers of
fuzzy control points in order to produced fuzzy Bezier
curve and fuzzy B-spline in the context of CAGD.

2. Fuzzy Set and Fuzzy Numbers
The introduction of fuzzy set theory by Zadeh in
1965‚Äôs has changed the way ambiguity. The ordinary
logical argument in mathematics have being changed
to fuzzy logic with more logical argument in order to
solved the complex situation in the real world. Instead
of ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù, logic value can be given in between
which take more value. Since that, the multiple logic
(fuzzy logic) have being used in many area of sciences,
many concepts had being generalized.
In normal theories we rejected the imprecision part
of the data to avoided imprecision model. Fuzzy theory
allows the formalization of approximate reasoning, and
preserves the original information contents of
imprecision [14]. We use fuzzy logic and the definition
of fuzzy numbers to introduce a new form of control
point for geometric modeling or CAGD. It used for
modeling large collections of uncertainty or noisy data.
Let us briefly discuss and given some example to
illustrate the important part and some idea about
fuzzy set theory which was first introduced by L.A.
Zadeh in 1965 [13]. In this section we discuss the
concept in fuzzy set and fuzzy numbers which is very
useful in the context of fuzzy modeling of uncertainty.
In order to define fuzzy set, let U be a ground set of
any fuzzy set A. The membership grade of an element
x in the set A is denoted by the function P A ( x), P A
maps all elements of U into the set A with values in the
continuous interval 0 to 1, P A : U o [0,1] .
~
Let A ¬ç U . A fuzzy set A is defined by
~
A {( x, P A ( x) : x ¬è U } .
For example, the fuzzy set A of real numbers R
with the condition that for every x in A, x must be
greater then 4. Then fuzzy set A defined over
characteristic function P described by
~
A {( x, P A ( x) : x ¬è R, x t 4} where
0
for x d 4,
¬≠
(

4
)
/
x
x
for x ! 4
¬Ø
Notice that the value of x=4 or less then are
definitely not members of the set. The value x nearest
to 4 from the right-hand side have a degree of self
belonging greater then 0. This fuzzy concept can be
generalized to the concept fuzzy data in the context of
fuzzy geometric modeling.
Any crisp can be fuzzified by the concept of fuzzy
generalization. Fuzzy number is the numerical
representation of an imprecision knowledge about
numerical quantities. By fuzzy arithmetic, the fuzzy
number can be extended in order to deal with

computations, and that used to manage uncertainty
values, such as those occurring due to many reason.
Infect the one particular type of fuzzy set is the
~
fuzzy number. A fuzzy set A is called a fuzzy number
(fuzzy set on real numbers R) if the following
condition is satisfied:
x There exist x ¬è R such that P A ( x) 1 and
For any D ¬è (0,1] the set {x : P A ( x) t D } is a
~ ~
closed interval denoted by [ AD , AD ]
A fuzzy number 4 is a fuzzy set with degree 1 at 4
contained in real numbers. It represents information
around the object 4 such as ‚Äúabout 4‚Äù. A fuzzy
number must has a unique modal value ‚Äú4‚Äù, be convex,
left and right piecewise continuous. See the figure
bellow.

describe as follow:

defined as:

results in a crisp set containing all member
of A that are non-zero,

3. The Extension Principal
The extension principle introduced by L.A. Zadeh
in 1975 is one the most important concept of fuzzy set
theory, which provided the basic framework to extend
crisp mathematic (such as crisp control points) concept
in to the fuzzy system.
~
Fuzzy function is a mapping of points in fuzzy A in
~
to (on to) a fuzzy set B . Fore more detail see
Zimmerman [3].
Fuzzy set with higher dimensionality the
membership functions are not constrained to being of
just one variable when a fuzzy set has a dimensional
higher then 1, it is called fuzzy relations. Infect Left

For fuzzy operating system such as fuzzy

intersection, fuzzy addition, bounded sum, bounded
difference, algebraic sum, algebraic product and fuzzy
direct product [1]. Here we give a few example of
fuzzy operation:

Figure 3. Mapping of fuzzy numbers

Using the extension principle [6] we have a
standard operations and arithmetic operators over the
set of fuzzy numbers. Our approach we considered
LFN and RFN as a softness distance of one uncertainty
data. All uncertainty data will be reduced to a set of
fuzzy number with their own alpha cut and applying
the extension principle we then produced our fuzzy
model.

4. Fuzzy Logic
Data manipulating and an operation fuzzy data we
used fuzzy logic in order to reduced, reproduced and
translate. Fuzzy logic is an ordinary logic which
contains an infinite number of membership values.
This is more natural logic which is close to human
logic. By this fuzzy logic, we can manage information
which involving the uncertainty condition in more
precise. For example: Fuzzy logic ‚ÄúIF...THEN‚Ä¶‚Äù is
very useful in order to model complicated data. It

differ from classical logic (dual logic) which truth
value just true and false see [6].

5. Fuzzy Control Points and Fuzzy Splines
The mains objective in CAGD is to produce a
smooth curves and surface. In order to gained a
solution about uncertainty of data modeling, A.
Weidon [11], fuzzy data describing a three
dimensional entity, order pair (x, y) and all of
uncertainty is in the altitude, z , component. Through
these types of control points, curve and surface is
interpolated and demonstrated the idea by developing
two- and three-dimensional surfaces from fuzzy data
for cubic splines and digital terrain models generated
from triangulation [11].
The method of construction curve and surface
presented in [10] was a first approach to a fuzzy
system for the design of curve and surfaces in the
context of CAGD.
By providing a set of points and used fuzzy rule,
and algorithm of all design method that interact
between the procedure and user. The use fuzzy number
and Takagi-Sugeno technique in fuzzy control can be
implemented design curve and surface [4].
The main objective of this concept papers is
introduced a new kind of control points for fuzzy
geometric modeling. In this paper we used a set of
~
fuzzy control points {Pi }in 0 in the form of Gaussian
fuzzy number in order to defined and constructive
process for the resulting a fuzzy curves or fuzzy spline
for all value
of t ¬è [0,1]. For the process of
constructive a fuzzy curve are not presented in this
paper.

a flexible tool for the modeling of uncertainty data

control points relative to crisps knot sequences

6. Conclusion
Due to the nature of fuzzy number its more suitable
for us to applied in order to getting a solution of the
problem. In Geometric Modeling, the problems of
uncertainty of data can be solved by using set of fuzzy
numbers as a fuzzy control points. The fuzzy curve
will interpolate or approximated the points and then
produced a fuzzy spline such fuzzy Bezier curve and
fuzzy B-spline. We should make a disguise between
error and uncertainty. For the error assumes a true
value exists. Uncertainty means incomplete knowledge
for their existing, may be some part is missing or
unstable position. These concepts can be generalized to
fuzzy surface model through the extension principle.
Many issues must be tackled before fuzzy sets can
widely used to give a solution of uncertain data
problems.
