Abstract
Many researches in Non-Photorealistic Rendering
(NPR) have been done to investigate a variety of
techniques to simulate the styles of hand-drawn artists.
Many applications in industrial, architectural, animated
film production, technical design, and computer graphics
designs have focused on rendering 3D models to depict
non-photorealism. Most of them are based on rendering
characters and object-based. This paper investigates on
non-photorealistic rendering techniques for 3D outdoor
scenes. Outdoor scene composed of a large extent of
natural phenomena of landscapes, plants, trees,
mountains, buildings, and many more. Techniques
discussed in this paper include silhouette and cartoonshaded renderings. Silhouette rendering implements
Brute Force approach to determine the silhouette edges.
Cel-shading algorithm in cartoon rendering renders the
objects in the scene by manipulating directional or
positional lightings with texture-shaded to give the scene
cartoon look.

1. Introduction
Non-photorealistic Rendering (NPR) has become an
important area of research in computer graphics. One
interesting fact in this area is that many of the techniques
developed over the years in computer graphics research
can be used here to create specific effects. Many NPR
image created started from 3D models and combine many
different algorithm to yield exactly the image the user
wants.

In computer graphics, photorealistic rendering
attempts to make virtual images of simulated 3D
environments that look like “the real world”. So nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR) is any technique that
produces images of simulated 3D world in a style other
than “realism”. Non-photorealistic rendering is a
representation of style for computer imagery using nonphotorealistic techniques to create artistic illustration
(sketch, pen and ink, hatching, etc), paintings (painterly
rendering) or render 3D scenes in styles which match the
“look” of traditional animated cartoon, which conveys
hand-drawn artistic illustration of art.
There is an overall reason why NPR might continue
to expand its influence within 3D graphics and perhaps
eventually grow to rival the importance of photorealistic
rendering: realism is expensive. We need a vast amount
of detail to faithfully represent and animate a realistic
natural scene. When a human designer creates that scene
by hand, the process necessarily requires great time and
effort. One strategy to avoid this inherent cost of realism
is to capture details from the real world. Examples
include are image-based rendering, 3D scanning, and
motion capture. But these strategies have limitations,
which they require that the desired data be present in the
real world at a suitable scale. For many applications,
including storytelling, this might not be the case. When
scanning isn’t an option, the alternative currently is to
hire a team of trained experts and let them painstakingly
model and animate the needed 3D content by hand. While
this strategy works, it’s only feasible for high-budget
industries such as games and movies. For 3D graphics to
reach new applications and attract new users, something
must change. We believe NPR has the potential to solve
the content creation problem because non-photorealistic
images can be far simpler to create by hand than
photorealistic ones.

Much of the research in NPR has targeted a
particular style of imagery and developed algorithms to
reproduce that style when rendering appropriatelyannotated 3D scenes and photographs. When comes to the
context of 3D scene rendering, it is usually involves nonphotorealistic rendering on 3D characters, technical
illustrations, virtual environment and geometrical objects.
There is not a deep insight on rendering a 3D outdoor
scene which depicts non-photorealism.
An outdoor scene consists of a combination of many
objects and geometrical elements such as trees, plants,
buildings, road, sky, and vehicles, are complex in
structure and sizes which is not easy to be rendered.
Many considerations on the different characteristics of
every element has to be done before rendering the scene
because various types of rendering techniques will be
used on different type of geometrical objects.

1.1 Difference between Photorealism and NonPhotorealistic
Photorealism is one representational form of images
to represent the external world in an “objective way”. It
creates images which depicts realism. Non-photorealistic
rendering exhibits a non-realistic image. Table 1 shows
the comparison between photorealism and nonphotorealistic.

1.2 Applications of NPR
In many applications, such as architectural,
industrial, automotive and graphics design, nonphotorealistic is preferred than photorealism. Nonphotorealistic conveys information better by omitting
extraneous details, by focusing attention on relevant
features, by clarifying, simplifying and disambiguating
shapes, and showing parts that are hidden. It also provides
more natural vehicle for conveying information at
different level of details. Besides, the resulting images are
more attractive as they add a sense of vitality difficult to
capture with photorealism.
In architectural designs, for example, an architect
presents the client with a preliminary design for a house
not yet built. An imprecise pencil sketch that omits many
details suggests to client that the design remains open for
revision, providing the exchange of ideas and keeping the
client happy.
Another example of the use of drawings instead of
photographs is the case of medical textbooks. Medical
textbooks employ schematic line drawing to illustrate
anatomical structures. It is because photographs tend to
imply an exactness and perfection of the scene to a real
object. Hand-drawn illustrations can better communicate
3D structure, elide the unimportant details and emphasize
important features only.
In paintings, a scene represents an artist’s view of
the world. All the information he wants to convey with
his image has to be assembled by strokes of a brush.
Therefore, to create a work of art, the artists would have
to understand their subject matter so that they could
include their interpretation of the important details in
rendering.
In the film production industry, most of the nonphotorealistic rendering work centers around the “toonshading” or the rendering of 3D objects to match the look
of traditionally drawn 2D artwork – for example, in the
cartoon animated movie Tarzan, where the painterly 3D
jungle, through which the 2D ape man swings, designed
in non-photorealistic style albeit in a recognized cartoonlike style. By using “toon-shading”, a form of nonphotorealistic rendering, to render 3D objects, graphics
designers can create more complex props, objects, and
scene with thousands of characters that would be far too
complex or costly to draw. Apparently, this allows them
to produce things in volume and at scale that would be
otherwise impossible.

1.3 Outdoor Scene
The term “outdoor” is antonymous with the term
“indoor”. Outdoor refers to things that that exist in the
open air, which involves scenery view of sky and land. It
does not relate to things in a closed-space area, such as in
a building or in a room. Outdoor scene exhibits geometric
complexity, which defines the environment of an openspace, conveying information of the atmosphere of the
real world. Outdoor environments are typically flat and
sparsely occluded, so the area that can be observed by
humans is rather large. Therefore, the sheer scale of
outdoor scenes is significantly larger than that of indoor
scenes. Outdoor scenes can be categorized in several
characteristics, which are:
i.

Natural scenery – scenery consists of natural
resources and beauty. For example, scene of a forest,
jungle, waterfall, seaside, ocean, and a garden of
flowers.

ii. Buildings – scenery contains buildings, which is
usually common for the architectural designs. For
example, the view of Petronas Twin Tower, offices
and shop houses, shopping complexes and
architectural building designs.
iii. Urban scenery – scene that reflects the real city life
and environment with skyscrapers, buildings,
vehicles and other elements found in urban city areas.
For example, New York city has various styles of
buildings and complex structures of lifestyle.
iv. Countryside scenery – scene that indicates the
lifestyle in countryside and its atmospheric landscape
with barns, cottages, coconut trees, mountains or
hills, paddy fields, farms and many more.

2. Related Work
The field of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR)
involves various techniques in rendering many types of
applications, namely in cartoon animations, film
productions, architectural designs, artistic paintings and in
technical illustrations.
The emerging applications of non-photorealistic
rendering have basically focused on rendering human and
cartoon characters, artwork masterpieces, and technical
tools. There is not a clear focus on rendering nonphotorealistic outdoor scenes. Apparently, most of the
researches are based on the rendering the realistic of an
outdoor environment in virtual reality environment [1].

The traditional strategy for immersive virtual
environments is to render detailed sets of 3D polygons
with appropriate lighting effects as the camera moves
through the model [2]. With this approach, the primary
challenge is constructing a digital representation for a
complex, visually rich, real-world environment.
In recent years, a few researchers have turned their
attention away from photorealism and towards developing
non-photorealistic rendering techniques in a variety of
styles and simulated media, such as impressionist painting
[3, 4, 5, 6], pen and ink [7, 8], technical illustration [9,
10], ornamentation [11], engraving [12, 13], watercolor
[14], and the style of Dr. Seuss [15]. Much of this work
has focused on creating still images either from
photographs, from computer-rendered reference images,
or directly from 3D models, with varying degrees of userdirection. One of their goals is to make their system work
in conjunction with any of these technologies, particularly
those that are more automated, to yield virtual
environments in many different styles.
Several stroke-based NPR systems have explored
time-changing imagery, confronting the challenge of
frame-to-frame coherence with varying success.
Winkenbach et al. [16] and later Curtis et al. [14]
observed that applying NPR techniques designed for still
images to time-changing sequences yields flickery, jittery,
noisy animations because strokes appear and disappear
too quickly. Meier [6] adapted Haeberli’s “paint by
numbers” scheme [3] in such a way that paint strokes
track features in a 3D model to provide frame-to-frame
coherence in painterly animation. Litwinowicz [5]
achieved a similar effect on video sequences using optical
flow methods to affix paint strokes to objects in the scene.
Markosian [17] found that silhouettes on rotating 3D
objects change slowly enough to give frame-to-frame
coherence for strokes drawn on the silhouette edges.

2.1 Techniques of NPR
There are many techniques available for nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR). Examples of the
techniques used in NPR are water-colour technique [14],
silhouettes rendering techniques [18], real-time rendering
[19], hatching, charcoal rendering, stylized sketching
[20], and pencil drawing techniques [21].
Different style of rendering produces different
effects to the rendered scene and images. Considerations
are made upon to the decision on rendering what kind of
objects relatively to its purpose, time and the usage
capability.

For outdoor scene, pen-and-ink illustration is usually
used in architectural designs where the ink outline of the
image gives a clear picture of the structure of the designs
and the texture tone effects resembles hand-drawn. As for
the water colour and painterly rendering, they are
commonly used to depict outdoor natural scenery which
involves natural resources. A sketchy artwork of outdoor
scene with black and white features is created using
halftoning techniques. Cartoon rendering is preferred in
cartoon film production to produce background scenes in
movies which convey cartoon resemblance.

3. Rendering Framework
There are several phases that should be implemented
in order to achieve the intended cartoon-shaded outdoor
scene, namely input of the 3D scene, which is then
rendered with silhouette and cartoon rendering
techniques.

to verify whether or not it is a silhouette. Brute Force
approach extracts the silhouette edges of the scene as the
approach is simple and its performance is faster than edge
buffer. Probabilistic method is usually used in animation
rendering where temporal coherence is considered.
Whereas Gauss Map Arc Hierarchy is only suitable for
orthogonal view, and Normal Cone Hierarchy is more
complex and difficult to be implemented.
Our focus is on Brute Force as it is the simplest form
to determine silhouettes. The implementation of
silhouette edge detection in the paper is based on the
algorithm described by Adam Lake et al.[23]. The
equation of the formula is shown in Equation 1, which
faceNormal1 and faceNormal2 represent normal of two
polygon faces adjacent to an edge, and eyeVect indicates
the viewing vector from the eye point. If the result of the
computation is less than or equal to zero, the edge is a
silhouette edge and it is flagged for rendering.
( faceNormal1 Ɣ eyeVect )*( faceNormal2 Ɣ eyeVect )  0
Equation 1

3.1 Silhouette
A silhouette is an edge that connects one back-facing
(invisible) polygon to a front-facing polygon. Therefore,
an edge is marked as a silhouette edge if a front-facing
(visible) and a back-facing (invisible) polygon share the
edge as illustrated in Figure 2.

3.2 Cartoon Rendering
Cartoon rendering is done to enhance the scene to
look like cartoon. The brunt of cartoon rendering lies in
the shading algorithm. Rather than smoothly interpolating
across an object as the Gouraud or Phong shading models
do, to give the object a three-dimensional appearance,
cartoon rendering typically uses solid colours that do not
vary across the material they represent, which helps add
lighting cues, cues to the shape and context of the object
in the scene, and even dramatic cues. Figure 3 illustrates a
production of 3D cartoon rendered outdoor scene which is
rendered using hard shading technique.

Figure 2 Silhouette edge detection. A silhouette
edge is an edge between a front-facing and a
back-facing polygon.
Generally, the silhouette set of a model can be
computed into two methods – in object space and in
screen space. The object space algorithms involve
computations in three dimensional (3D) views and
produce a list of silhouette edges or curves for a given
viewpoint. The screen space algorithms, on the other
hand, involve image processing techniques and are useful
if rendering silhouettes is the only goal. There are many
approaches in extracting and detecting silhouette edges in
object space [30].
The Brute Force method of silhouette extraction
simply tests each edge in the polygonal mesh sequentially

For shading, we need to calculate the directional
light which to find how much light each vertex receives
by calculating the dot product of the light vector and the
normal vector of a vertex. As described by Sam Hamlaoui
[24], the dot product function calculates the angle
between two vectors and results a value with a maximum
of 1. The result of the function L x n is actually the
cosine of the angle formed between the two vectors. Since
the result of a dot product has a maximum value of 1, we
can use the result of the dot product as the texture
coordinate to map to our greyscale texture map. If the
result of the dot product is less than 0, then the texture
coordinate is considered as 0. It is because texture
coordinates are stored between 0 and 1(0  x  1), which
happens to be that the dot product of the normal and the
lighting direction vector actually gives us the texture
coordinate. The resulted numbers are used as the index
for the 1D texture mapping coordinates. The dot product
function generating texture coordinates is shown in
Figure 4.

of a computer model as seen from an observer viewpoint
moving under interactive control by the user. If the
rendered images are visually compelling, and they are
refreshed quickly enough, the user feels a sense of
presence in a virtual world, enabling applications in
education, computer-aided design, electronic commerce,
and entertainment.
While research in virtual environments has
traditionally striven for photorealism, for many
applications there are advantages to non-photorealistic
rendering (NPR). Artistic expression can often convey a
specific mood (e.g. cheerful or dreary) difficult to imbue
in a synthetic, photorealistic scene. Furthermore, through
abstraction and careful elision of detail, NPR imagery can
focus the viewer’s attention on important information
while downplaying extraneous or unimportant features.
An NPR scene can also suggest additional semantic
information, such as a quality of “unfinishedness” that
may be desirable when, for example, an architect shows a
client a partially-completed design. Finally, an NPR look
is often more engaging than the prototypical stark,
pristine computer graphics rendering.

4. Conclusion
Many techniques of NPR has been introduced over
these years, namely stylized sketching, pen-and-ink
illustration,
water-colourization,
cartoon-shading,
hatching, painterly rendering and silhouette rendering.
These techniques are useful many applications in
industrial designs, architectural drawings, medical and
scientific visualizations, film production, cartoon
animations, games development and computer graphics
designs. Creating a non-photorealistic scene in the
graphics applications is commonly known as virtual
environment.
Virtual environments allow us to explore an ancient
historical site, visit a new home with a real estate agent,
or fly through the twisting corridors of a space station in
pursuit of alien prey. They simulate the visual experience
of immersion in a 3D environment by rendering images

The emerging applications of non-photorealistic
rendering have basically focused on rendering human and
cartoon characters, artwork masterpieces, and technical
tools. In animation production, sketching and cartoon
rendering system [25] on character based is developed for
animated cartoon characters. Initially, there was a 3D
scene rendering system [27] which produced cartoon-like
scene using two-shaded features on objects. Then,
sketching and cartoon techniques [23] are investigated to
produce 3D animated characters where the scenes are
scalable. There is not a clear focus on rendering nonphotorealistic outdoor scenes. Apparently, most of the
researches are based on the rendering the realistic of an
outdoor environment in virtual reality environment [22].
Furthermore, as outdoor scenes are complex, they
are not easy to be rendered as a whole compared to the
character-based non-photorealistic rendering. It is because
outdoor scene contains many types of elements which
have different characteristics, for example– the style of
rendering for a building is different from the technique
used to render a tree. This is true as there were many
researches were done on rendering of trees [25], grass
[26], deformable objects [28], technical illustrations [9]
and geometrical objects [29] which these are the elements
in outdoor scenes.

Therefore, rendering techniques for outdoor scene
are to be investigated to achieve a 3D outdoor scene with
non-photorealistic features. We have presented a basic
method in rendering 3D outdoor scene which resembles
cartoon. Suggested improvement to this methodology
includes rendering different types of outdoor scenes –
natural, countryside and city scenes, which can be later
used in the film and movies production, paintings and
computer designs. Various techniques can be combined
and reconstructed based on the different structure and
characteristics of the elements in the scene to produce the
best result of a non-photorealistic outdoor scene.
