Our Approach
In this poster, we introduce a new interactive visualization

Our technique uses three basic components:
a business parameter correlationmatrix to determine the

analyses, partial matching techniques, as well as cluster,
and classificationanalysis.
a triple-parameter symmetric circular graph layout to
represent the source,

attributes
a process flow matrix to link multiple circular graphs

Our technique has been designed to
for large volumes of
complex business process data. The automatic analysis
determines the important relationships and the visualization
shows the detected relationships.
contrast to Parallel
Coordinate displays [I], we restrict the visualization to three
in one circular display and multiple displays are
linked to show more than 3 parameters. In addition, we adapt a
new layout to give more weight to important data values.

In order to give important information more attention, we.
