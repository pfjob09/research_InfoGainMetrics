This year's InfoVis Contest invites
to analyze InfoVis
1995 to 2002 and their references. Based

the participants are asked to use visualization tools to: 1)
major research areas, 2) characterize these

evolution, and 3) discover collaboration relationships among
researchers. (Tasks 3 and 4 are combined into one throughout our
as suggested by the contesthtml template.)
For over a decade, researchers at the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed a number of text
visualization tools customized for different applications. Many of
them have been presented previously at this symposium. We

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The development of IN-SPIRE has been a long and
R&D
journey among the developers and end users. We have, in a
sense, co-invented many practical solutions for many real-life
problems. While we have enjoyed great success using IN-SPIRE
in many applications, we still need to address open problems such
as
