Abstract
A sequential pattern in data mining is a finite series of
elements such as A → B → C → D where A, B, C, and
D are elements of the same domain. The mining of sequential patterns is designed to find patterns of discrete events that frequently happen in the same arrangement along a timeline. Like association and
clustering, the mining of sequential patterns is among
the most popular knowledge discovery techniques that
apply statistical measures to extract useful information
from large datasets. As our computers become more
powerful, we are able to mine bigger datasets and obtain hundreds of thousands of sequential patterns in
full detail. With this vast amount of data, we argue that
neither data mining nor visualization by itself can
manage the information and reflect the knowledge effectively. Subsequently, we apply visualization to augment data mining in a study of sequential patterns in
large text corpora. The result shows that we can learn
more and more quickly in an integrated visual datamining environment.

Introduction

The task of sequential patterns in knowledge discovery and data mining is to identify the item that frequently precedes another item. Generally a sequential
pattern can be described as a finite series of elements
such as A → B → C → D where A, B, C, and D are
elements of the same domain. Each sequential pattern
in data mining comes with a minimum support value,
which indicates the percentage of total records that
contain the pattern. An arbitrary example of a sequential pattern is 90% of the die-hard fans who saw the
movie Titanic went on to buy the movie sound track
CD, followed by the videotape when it was released.
The primary goal of sequential pattern discovery is
to assess the evolution of events against a measured
timeline and detect changes that might occur coincidentally. This information has been used to detect

medical fraud in insurance claims, evaluate drug performances in pharmaceutical industry, and determine
risk factors in military operations. Although the definition of sequential patterns varies slightly among different disciplines and applications, they all share a similar
goal that can be traced back to the groundbreaking
work by Agrawal and Srikant [1].
This paper presents a powerful visual data-mining
[13] system that contains a customized sequential pattern discovery engine and an interactive visualization
tool. The system was developed to support our ongoing

research
[6][8][10][12][14] on large unstructured document
corpora. The objective is to discover inter-transaction
patterns such that the presence of a topic is followed by
another topic. We show that we can learn more and
more quickly by augmenting the data-mining process
with visualization in an integrated visual data-mining
[13] environment. We demonstrate the results using a
time-series corpus that spans a 7-year period.

Related Work

In an earlier paper, we presented an original technique to visualize topic association rules in text mining
[14]. An association rule is an implication of the form
X → Y where X is a set of antecedent items and Y is
the consequent item. Given a domain set of elements,
for example {A, B, C, D}, A → B → C → D is a sequential pattern while A + B + C → D is an association
rule. A sequential pattern is the study of “ordering” or
“arrangement” of elements, whereas an association rule
is the study of “togetherness” of elements. Some of our
other text mining and visualization work includes thematic analysis of long articles using orthogonal wavelets [8] as well as topic clustering of corpora based on
multidimensional scaling and other statistical measures
[12].
Conventional sequential pattern mining work on
relational databases can be found in the classic work by
Srikant and Agrawal [1][9]. Unfortunately, visualization is not emphasized in their work.

MineSet by Silicon Graphics has perhaps the best
balance between powerful knowledge discovery functions and an impressive 3D interactive visualization
[2][3] for more than a dozen mining tasks. However,
sequential pattern discovery is not supported.
Westphal and Blaxton [11] give an excellent introduction to state-of-the-art visualization and data mining
techniques available in both commercial and public
domain packages.

Data Description and Pre-Processing

The experimental results and graphics presented in
Section 4 are generated using a corpus obtained from
open sources. The medium-sized (~1MB) corpus is
stored as an ASCII file with about 1,170 articles collected from 1991 to 1997. This corpus has a strong
theme associated with nuclear smuggling news
throughout the 90s. The second dataset is a news corpus harvested from the TREC5 distribution disks. It
covers the entire year of 1990 including events such as
the Iraq-Kuwait conflict that led to Desert Storm.

3.1

Topic Extraction

The first step in processing the corpus is to identify
an interesting set of content-bearing words from the
articles. Words separated by white spaces in a corpus
are evaluated within the context of the corpus to assess
whether a word is interesting enough to be a topic.
Bookstein’s [4] ideas regarding identification of content-bearing words are used to assess the relative contribution of a word to the content of the corpus. The cooccurrence or lack of co-occurrence of these interesting
words in documents is used to evaluate the strengths of
the words. Stemming is used to remove suffixes so that
similar words are represented by the root word. Commonly appearing words that do not directly contribute
to the content – such as prepositions, pronouns, adjectives, and gerunds – are ignored. The result is a set of
content-bearing words that represent the entire major
topics (or themes) of the corpus.

3.2

Multiresolution Binning

Because our primary goal is to study sequential
patterns of the daily events recorded in a corpus, every
topic word that appears in articles with the same time
stamp is binned together in a topic subset for the mining task. Similarly, we can bin the topics by weeks,
months, or years to show different resolutions of sequential patterns. The idea is to capture the topic patterns of the news stories that span different time intervals such as days, months, or years.

Discovery of Sequential Patterns

Although different applications have varying definitions of “sequential patterns,” they all share the same
basic intention to find the repeating patterns of discrete
events along a timeline. In the study of market basket
databases, the goal is to track individual buyers’ purchasing patterns [1]. The intent of our investigation,
however, is to find sequential patterns of major topics
extracted from a corpus. We show that either visualization or data mining alone can carry out the discovery
task with a certain degree of success up to a certain
point.

4.1

Discovery by Visualization

We present a simple visualization example to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using visualization to discover sequential patterns. Figure 1 is a plot of
“topic combinations” versus time that we discussed in
[6]. If we replace “topic combinations” with individual
topics in Figure 1, we can spot the sequential patterns
of individual topics by comparing the icons of individual columns along the timeline.
4.1.1

Strength of Visualization

The strength of this visualization approach is that
we can quickly obtain an overall structural view of
topic patterns and their distribution. We can see not
only the frequency of the patterns but also the occurrence dates of individual events.

4.1.2

Weakness of Visualization

A major weakness of this visualization approach is
the precision of the pattern. We do not know the exact
connections of a pattern. A second weakness is the lack
of statistical support of individual patterns. Because we
can only display a portion of the corpus at a time, it is
impossible to predict the distribution and concentration
of the patterns when they are not displayed on screen.
These problems, however, can be solved by including a
data mining step ahead of the visualization.

4.2

Discovery by Data Mining

The discovery of sequential patterns plays an important role in today’s data mining industry [11]. Almost every application, however, has its own specific
definition and requirements. For example, we treat a
break in the input data as a break in the patterns. A
possible alternative is to simply accept a wider time
gap. Instead of adding more parameters to our system,
we choose to provide a multiresolution approach with
different binning sizes to provide a coarser pattern that
might otherwise be broken up by a single daybreak.
Our customized text-mining engine builds the pattern structure using an n-ary tree with n branches, also
known as a trie in the study of computer algorithms.

Each node of the tree represents an element, i.e., a
topic in our case, of the pattern sequences. The pattern
is a valid pattern if its support value is larger than a
pre-defined threshold value. The support value is calculated as the number of occurrences of the pattern in
the dataset. Elements of a pattern are in sequential records in the input. A break in the input data represents a
break in the rules.
Figure 2 shows a basic example of mining sequential patterns of a corpus with a topic domain of {A, B,
C} within a 6-day period. During the first phase, we
build all the patterns with 2 topics. For example, the
pattern A→ B happens in Day 2 to Day 3 and Day 5 to
Day 6; the support is 2/6 = 0.33.
We then calculate the frequency of each pattern and
prune the leaves of the trees with support values less
than the threshold, i.e., 10% or 0.1 in this case. Because an n-topic sequential pattern must have the same
or higher support than any patterns with the same n
leading topics, we can prune the leaves of a trie as soon
as they fail the threshold test. For example, the 2-topic
pattern A → C appears at least as often as any patterns
with the same two leading topics such as A → C → B.
If the support of A → C is below the threshold, the
support of A → C → B will only be the same or lower.

Figure 2: An example to illustrate the mining of sequential patterns from a small time-series dataset.
The input data are blue. The output patterns and their supports are green. The mining task completes after two phases of matching and pruning.

In the second phase, we match the qualified 2-topic
patterns with the input data and generate the new 3topic patterns followed by another round of threshold
pruning. This process is repeated with a new topic appended to the previously qualified patterns every time,
until the input data are exhausted. In the example
shown in Figure 2, the process stops after two phases.
The patterns are listed in the final phase with their
support values. The pattern A → C happens in Day 1 to
2 and Day 2 to 3; the support is 2/6 = 0.33. The pattern
A → C → B only happens once; the support is 1/6 =
0.167.
4.2.1

Performance and Statistics

We study the performance of our data mining engine using the nuclear smuggling corpus described in
Section 3. The topics of the corpus are binned into
topic subsets. There are 766 daily bins, 76 monthly
bins, and 7 yearly bins. The last (yearly) case is merely
for the sake of completeness. We really cannot learn
anything from a domain size of 7. The runtime parameters and statistics of the mining process are listed
in Table 1. With proper pruning and realistic support
thresholds, we encounter no problem processing the
corpus on a standard SUN ULTRA 10.

in Figure 1 or the one presented in Section 5 can solve
this problem. We simply plot the patterns along the
timeline whenever it happens.
A second weakness is the size of the text output. In
our experiments, we can easily generate hundreds of
thousands of patterns from a medium-size corpus with
a few thousand articles. A picture may not be worth a
thousand words, but humans do learn faster from a
visual display than a text document filled with sequences.

Visual Data Mining

Our discussion in Section 4 suggests that the
strengths of visualization and data mining can be used
to compensate for each other’s weaknesses in the discovery of sequential patterns. We present a visual data
mining system that uses visualization to augment the
data mining process and takes advantage of the
strengths of both worlds.

Strength of Data Mining

The strength of the data mining approach is that it
provides accurate support information for all sequential
patterns as well as their sub-patterns. We can study not
only the strongest patterns but also the weaker ones and
those in between. This can compensate for the lack of
support information in the previous visualization approach.
4.2.3

Weakness of Data Mining

A major weakness of the data mining approach is
that we lose the temporary distribution of individual
sequences. We only know there is a strong pattern, but
we do not know whether it happens frequently within a
short period of time or if it spreads evenly along the
timeline. This locality information is particularly important if we analyze a large corpus that spans multiple
years. A simple visualization that is similar to the one

terns. A corpus of narrative text is fed into a text engine for topic extraction. Selected topics in each article
are binned together for the mining engine described in
Section 4 to generate the sequential patterns with their
support information. Finally, the patterns are sent to the
visualization system for further analysis.

5.2

Visualization of Sequential Patterns

We present a novel technique to visualize pattern
sequences as well as their strengths along a time line.
The Java-based system can be executed on multiple
platforms including PC, Mac, and UNIX. The basic
visualization design is sketched at the bottom of Figure
3. Topics are listed on the left-hand side.
Each vertical axis represents the topics of one time
step. Each connecting line represents a sequential pattern. Colors are used to show the support of the patterns as well as sub-patterns. The appearance of our
visualization is somewhat similar to parallel coordinates [5][7]. The horizontal axis (time) has a natural
ordering, but the ordering of the elements on the vertical axis (topics) is essentially arbitrary. This is different
from the situation in parallel coordinates where the
ordering of the horizontal parallel axes is arbitrary, and
the ordering of the elements on the vertical axes is
given.
Figure 4 shows a snapshot of the prototype system.
The vertical lines are turned off to simplify the display.
The beginning of a pattern is marked by a black dot.

Four basic colors – blue, red, yellow, and white – are
used to show different levels of support values that are
normalized for visualization. Shading is turned on to
blend the colors between two consecutive topics of a
pattern. The four white dashed circles highlight the
four appearances of the same two pattern sequences
“plutonium → red” and “plutonium → mercury”.
These patterns came from the articles recorded right
after the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1992.
Western European officials frequently seized plutonium and a substance known as “red mercury” said to
be smuggled from the former Soviet Union. The mysterious “red mercury”, which was reportedly peddled
throughout Europe and the Middle East by Russian
businessmen who made fortunes, turned out to be a
hoax.

5.3

Multiresolution Visualization and Query

Figure 5 depicts another visualization using the
same corpus but with different binning resolution. This
time we bin the topics of the articles monthly instead of
daily. As the figure shows, this can drastically increase
the number of sequential patterns in our visualization
because we now have fewer bins (76) but each bin has
a lot more topics accumulated. In Table 1, we show
that we can get as many as 444K patterns using 10%
support threshold. A quick way to clear up this visualization is to increase the threshold values. The number
of patterns drops from 444K to less than 600 after we
up the threshold from 10% to 25%. The visualization in

lines are used to connect the topics to form a sequential pattern. The beginning of a pattern is marked
by a black dot. Four basic colors – shown at the bottom – are used to indicate the support of a pattern
and its sub-patterns. Shading is turned on to blend the colors between two sub-pattern support values.
The four white dashed circles mark the four appearances of the same two patterns within an 8-month
period from Jan 92 to Aug 92.

Figure 5: A visualization snapshot of sequential patterns using the monthly binning topic sets.
Figure 5 has a minimum
threshold value of 25%. Another practical option provided
by our prototype is the topic
query capability to select patterns with particular topics. A
pop-up topic selection window,
as shown in Figure 6, allows
users to pick patterns associated
with an individual topic or a set
of topics.

Discussion

In data mining studies, a lot
of research activities involve
the integration of data mining
and databases. The idea is to
provide selection capabilities to

query languages. In information
visualization, numerous multiresolution efforts – such
as the context/focus approach or the overallstructure/local-details approach – help humans see the
whole and select the parts. Both communities are trying
to find an effective way to extract knowledge from
massive amounts of data by eliminating unwanted and
usually noisy information.
Without the statistics measures to reflect the support
of a pattern, the visualization would be meaningless.
We simply don’t know if a sequence is strong enough
to be a “pattern” even though we can spot it. With the
graphical encoding of visualization, the pattern mining
approach would be enhanced with both spatial and

temporal information that in turn help humans to interpret the mining results. We show that, in this particular
case, it is better to combine the statistical efforts of data
mining with the human participation of visualization to
achieve the ultimate goal of knowledge discovery.
Our visual data mining system described in this paper is neither perfect nor complete. It would be helpful
to have secondary memory support for our data-mining
engine so that we can handle even larger datasets. It
would also help to increase the display volume of our
visualization system; a pixel-based visualization design
may help to accomplish this goal. Perhaps using visualization to enhance the topic-matching and treepruning algorithm of a data mining process would be
an even stronger visual data-mining paradigm [13].

Conclusions

This paper presents data mining and visualization
techniques for discovery of sequential patterns from
large datasets. We conclude that the strengths of the
two approaches can compensate for each other’s weaknesses. We then introduce a powerful visual datamining environment that contains a data-mining engine
to discover the patterns and their support values and a
visualization front-end to show the distribution and
locality of the patterns. Our result shows that we can
learn more and more quickly in such an integrated visual data-mining environment.
Our long-term goal is to integrate many of our tools
and techniques such as association rules [14] into a
single visual data mining environment that provides
user-friendly navigation, in-depth association and implication analysis, time sequence analysis, hypothesis
explanation, and document summarization.
