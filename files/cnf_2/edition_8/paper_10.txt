Distributions

Abstract
Poisson disk distributions have many applications in the field of computer graphics. Besides sampling, Poisson
disk distributions are used in object distribution, non-photorealistic rendering and procedural texturing. Over the
years, a large number of methods for generating Poisson disk distributions have been proposed, making it difficult to
choose the right method for a given application. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of most techniques
for generating Poisson disk distributions. The methods we study include dart throwing, relaxation dart throwing,
Lloyd’s relaxation, Shade’s Poisson disk tiles, tiled blue noise samples, fast hierarchical importance sampling with
blue noise properties, edge-based Poisson disk tiles, template Poisson disk tiles, corner-based Poisson disk tiles
and recursive Wang tiles for real-time blue noise. Analysing all of these methods within a single framework is one
of the major contributions of this work.

1. Introduction

ferent methods and the resulting distributions in detail and
providing guidelines to decide which method to use.

Poisson disk distributions are used frequently in computer
graphics. One of the most important applications is sampling.
Over the last decades, many different sampling patterns have
been studied and analysed. It is now generally accepted that,
because of its blue noise properties, the Poisson disk distribution is one of the best sampling patterns for a wide range
of applications [Yel82]; [Yel83]; [DW85]; [Coo86]; [Mit87];
[Mit91]. In addition to sampling, Poisson disk distributions
have several other important applications in computer graphics, such as object distribution [DHL∗ 98], [CSHD03], primitive distribution for illustration [SHS02] and texture basis
functions [LD05a].

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give
an overview of related work. In Section 3, we review techniques for analyzing Poisson disk distributions. In the following sections, we discuss several methods for generating
Poisson disk distributions in detail. These include dart throwing (Section 4), relaxation dart throwing (Section 5), Lloyd’s
relaxation (Section 6), Shade’s Poisson disk tiles (Section
7), tiled blue noise samples (Section 8), fast hierarchical importance sampling with blue noise properties (Section 9),
edge-based Poisson disk tiles (Section 10), template Poisson
disk tiles (Section 11), corner-based Poisson disk tiles (Section 12) and recursive Wang tiles for real-time blue noise
(Section 13). In Section 14 we conclude.

Because of this wide interest, a large number of methods
for generating Poisson disk distributions has been developed
over the years. These methods, and the distributions they generate, often have very different characteristics. This makes it
difficult to choose the right method for a given application.
In this paper, we address this problem by comparing the dif-

this is not the case.

2. Related Work
Poisson disk distributions were introduced in the field of computer graphics to solve the aliasing problem. Aliasing is a major source of artifacts in digitally synthesized images. This
problem was first identified by Crow [Cro77]. Dipp´e and
Wold [DW85], Cook [Coo86] and Mitchell [Mit87] introduced non-uniform sampling to turn regular aliasing patterns
into featureless noise, which is perceptually less objectable.
The Poisson disk distribution was identified as one of the
best sampling patterns. Their work was based on studies by
Yellot [Yel82,Yel83], who found that the photoreceptors in
the retina of the eye are distributed according to a Poisson
disk distribution, an indication that this sampling pattern is
effective for imaging.
Poisson disk distributions are traditionally generated using an expensive dart throwing algorithm [Coo86]. Fast
methods that generate approximate Poisson disk distributions have been suggested by various authors [DW85, Mit87,
Mit91, Kla00]. The algorithm mostly used nowadays is due
to [MF92]. It generalizes over the dart throwing approach,
and uses Lloyd’s relaxation scheme [Llo82] to optimize the
generated distribution.
Already in 1985, Dipp´e and Wold [DW85] suggested to
replicate a pre-computed tile with Poisson disk distributed
points across the plane. Since then, several tile-based methods were proposed. Most of them use Wang tiles, square tiles
with coloured edges [Wan61, Wan65, GS86, CSHD03]. The
first tile based method, an extension of the dart throwing
algorithm, was presented by Shade et al. [SCM00]. Hiller
et al. [HDK01] used Lloyd’s relaxation algorithm to construct a Poisson disk distribution over a set of Wang tiles.
This method of was later adopted by Cohen et al. [CSHD03].
Ostromoukhov et al. [ODJ04] presented an interesting technique to generate a distribution with blue noise properties
over a given density, based on the Penrose tiles and Lloyd’s
relaxation scheme. Lagae and Dutr´e proposed improved construction methods for Poisson disk tiles based on Wang tiles
[LD05a] and corner tiles [LD06a], and also studied requirements for generating tiled Poisson disk distributions with
good spectral properties [LD05b]. Kopf et al. [KCODL06]
presented a method to generate Poisson disk distributions
over a given density in real time, based on recursive Wang
tiles that contain self-similar and progressive Poisson distributions.
Recently, Jones [Jon06] and Dunbar and Humphreys
[DH06] presented efficient implementations of the dart
throwing algorithm.
Tools to analyse the spectral properties of point sets were
introduced by Ulichney [Uli87], in the context of dithering.

3. Specification and Analysis
A Poisson disk distribution is a 2D uniform point distribution
in which all points are separated from each other by a minimum distance. Half that distance is called the radius r of the
distribution. If a disk of that radius is placed at each point,
then no two disks overlap.
3.1. Radius specification
To specify the radius of a Poisson disk distribution, we follow
the convention of Lagae and Dutr´e [LD05a]. Rather than
using the absolute radius r, we use the relative radius ρ.
The densest packing of disks in the plane is the hexagonal
lattice [Ste99], with a packing density η of
π
η = √ ≈ 0.9069.
2 3

(1)

The packing density is defined as the fraction of the area filled
by the disks. When distributing N disks over a unit toroidal
domain, the maximum disk area is thus η/N. The maximum
possible disk radius rmax is therefore given by
rmax =

1
√ .
2 3N

(2)

The Poisson disk radius r of a given distribution of points can
be specified as a fraction ρ ∈ [0 . . . 1] of the maximum disk
radius
r = ρrmax .

(3)

Contrary to the absolute radius, the relative radius is independent of the number of points and the size of the domain of
the point distribution. The relative radius is a measure of how
well the points are distributed. A uniformly distributed point
set can have a relative radius of 0, and the relative radius of a
hexagonal lattice equals 1. Poisson disk distributions should
have a relative radius that is large (ρ ≥ 0.65), but not too large
(ρ ≤ 0.85), because regular configurations must be avoided.
3.2. Spectral analysis
Radial statistics are the first important tool to evaluate the
quality of a Poisson disk distribution. A second important
tool is a study of the frequency domain characteristics of the
Poisson disk distribution. The technique described here was
first used by Ulichney to study dither patterns [Uli87].
To estimate the power spectrum P(f ), Ulichney uses
Bartlett’s method of averaging periodograms [Bar55]. The
periodogram of a Poisson disk distribution of N points
{x0 , . . . , xN−1 } ⊂ [0, 1)2 is the magnitude squared of the
Fourier transform of the distribution

Thus, the spectral properties of a method for generating
Poisson disk distributions are obtained by averaging periodograms from Poisson disk distributions generated with that
method. It is important to note that a periodogram is associated with a single Poisson disk distribution, while the power
spectrum estimate is associated with a specific method for
generating Poisson disk distributions (e.g. a specific algorithm with a fixed set of parameters).
The periodogram of a Poisson disk distribution is radially
symmetric. Therefore, two one-dimensional statistics are derived from the power spectrum. The first one is the radially
averaged power spectrum

Figure 2 shows the typical power spectrum and radially
averaged power spectrum and anisotropy of a uniform distribution. As expected, the power spectrum is flat.
In this work, we judge the quality of methods for generating Poisson disk distributions by comparing radial statistics
and power spectra. These two measures cover a wide range
of applications. Other measures exist, but these are usually
geared towards a specific application (e.g. numerical integration).
As in Ulichney’s work, the spectral estimates in this paper
were produced by averaging K = 10 periodograms. Therefore, an anisotropy of −10 dB should be considered background noise. In both cases, the anisotropy is low (close to
−10 dB), indicating good radial symmetry. A reference line
at −10 dB appears in all anisotropy plots.

This ensures that the periodogram covers a domain corresponding to twice the principal frequency of a Poisson disk
distribution with a relative radius of 0.75 (634 × 634 for
16384 points). This number is rounded to the next power of
two (1024 × 1024 for 16384 points). Thus, all power spectra
and plots are at the same scale. The width of the annuli is
one sample.
All power spectrum images were tone mapped with a logarithmic tone mapper, using the same settings for all images.
The radially averaged power spectrum was normalized. The
high-magnitude DC peak was removed from all plots.

Please note that comparing periodograms, power spectrum
estimates and radially averaged power and anisotropy graphs
of previously published papers is very difficult. Often the
distinction between periodogram and power spectrum is not
made, periodograms and power spectra are tone mapped with
different settings, and power and anisotropy graphs are computed with wide annuli, effectively smoothing the graphs.
Analysing all methods within a single framework is the major contribution of this paper.

In the mid-80s, Dipp´e and Wold [DW85], Cook [Coo86] and
Mitchell [Mit87] introduced non-uniform sampling and the
Poisson disk distribution to solve the aliasing problem. Cook
[Coo86] proposed the dart throwing algorithm for generating
Poisson disk distributions.

obtained on a regular desktop PC with an AMD Athlon(tm)

in the distribution is difficult to predict, and if the process is
stopped too soon, the density of the points is not uniform.

The dart throwing algorithm generates uniformly distributed points, and rejects points that do not satisfy the minimum separation with already generated points. This process
continues until no more points can be added. To correctly
handle boundary conditions, the Poisson disk distributions
are typically generated over a toroidal domain.

The dart throwing algorithm can be improved by combining it with the relative radius specification. The improved
algorithm takes as input the desired number of points and
the relative radius of the Poisson disk distribution. This
solves the radius specification problem. Experiments show
that dart throwing is capable of generating Poisson disk distributions with a relative radius up to 0.75. Termination, however, is still not guaranteed, and generating large Poisson
disk distributions (100,000 points or more) is very difficult in
practice.

Dart throwing is widely used and is easy to implement.
However, the algorithm is also slow, and difficult to control:
instead of specifying the number of points, the radius of the
distribution has to be provided, the final number of points

Figure 3 shows the power spectrum of Poisson disk distributions generated with the dart throwing algorithm. The
radially averaged power spectrum exhibits the typical blue
noise properties, and the anisotropy is low.

and Humphreys also present a linear and boundary sampling
algorithm. The power spectrum of those methods is shown
in Figure 6. The linear method is supposed to be slightly
faster than the logarithmic algorithm. The peaks in the power

Recently, Jones [Jon06] presented an efficient implementation of the dart throwing algorithm, based on the Voronoi
diagram. Figure 4 shows the power spectrum of Poisson disk
distributions generated with this method. As expected, the
method has the same spectral properties as the traditional dart
throwing algorithm. However, the generated distributions are
not toroidal. This explains the central horizontal and vertical
lines in the power spectrum, and the increased anisotropy at
low radial frequencies. The algorithm of Jones is very fast.
The time required to generate a Poisson disk distribution of
16384 points with a relative radius of 0.70 and 0.75 is respectively 3.511 and 3.403 seconds.

Although the traditional dart throwing algorithm is terribly

5. Relaxation Dart Throwing
In 1992, McCool and Fium´e [MF92] proposed an improved
version of the dart throwing algorithm, which we call relaxation dart throwing.
Relaxation dart throwing is similar to dart throwing. However, points are placed with a large radius initially, and once
no more space has been found for a large number of attempts,
the radius is reduced by some fraction. The Poisson disk distributions generated with relaxation dart throwing are usually
toroidal, and also hierarchical.
This algorithm has several advantages compared to dart
throwing: it is somewhat faster, it allows to specify the desired
number of points rather than the radius, and termination is
guaranteed.
Figure 7 shows the power spectrum of Poisson disk distributions generated with the relaxation dart throwing. The
spectral characteristics of Poisson disk distributions generated with dart throwing and relaxation dart throwing are very
similar. The transition region seems to be a little bit steeper
for Poisson disk distributions generated with relaxation dart
throwing.

8 (top), 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and
16384 (bottom) points, generated with dart throwing, versus
the number of relaxation iterations.

The time required to generate a Poisson disk distributions
of 16384 points using an initial radius 0.15, a radius reduction
factor of 0.9, 0.99 and 0.999 and 100, 1000 and 10,000 failed
attempts is, respectively, 0.020, 0.289 and 11.733 seconds.
The relative radius of the generated distributions is respectively, 0.57, 0.68 and 0.73.

6. Lloyd’s Relaxation
After a Poisson disk distribution is generated using relaxation
dart throwing, McCool and Fium´e [MF92] apply Lloyd’s relaxation [Llo82] to increase the radius of the Poisson disk
distribution.
Lloyd’s relaxation is an iterative process: in each iteration,
the Voronoi diagram of the point set is computed, and each
point is moved to the centroid of its Voronoi cell. To correctly
handle boundary conditions, Lloyd’s relaxation is performed
over a toroidal domain.
Lloyd’s relaxation can be used as a post-process for increasing the radius of a Poisson disk distribution generated
with any technique, or as a standalone technique that generates a Poisson disk distribution from an uniform point distribution.
Figure 8 shows the radius of Poisson disk distributions
generated with dart throwing versus the number of relaxation iterations. For distributions up to 16384 points, Lloyd’s
relaxation converges in about 16 to 32 iterations. Poisson disk
distributions with less points seem to converge to a slightly
higher radius, but in general all distributions settle for a relative radius of about 0.75 to 0.85. Lloyd’s relaxation is the only
technique that allows to generate Poisson disk distributions
with such a high radius.

not seem to be a problem. Also, the problem can be avoided
by monitoring the radius during relaxation.
The time required for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 iterations, starting
from a uniform distribution of 16384 points, is respectively,
21.308, 35.661, 64.397, 120.448, 234.140 and 458.460 seconds.

Wang tiles are square tiles with coloured edges. To tile the
plane with a set of Wang tiles, the tiles are placed with their
corners on the integer lattice points, such that adjoining edges
have matching colors. The tiles cannot be rotated.
Shade et al. construct a Poisson disk distribution over a set
of eight Wang tiles using an algorithm similar to dart throwing. Before a point is added to a tile, all possible neighbouring
tiles are checked, and the point is rejected if the minimum
separation criterion is not met. Once a Poisson disk distribution is constructed over a set of Wang tiles, arbitrary large
Poisson disk distributions can be generated in real time by
stochastically tiling the plane with the Wang tiles. For more
details, we refer to [SCM00].

Figure 9 shows the power spectrum of Poisson disk distributions generated with dart throwing after several relaxation iterations. The peak at the principal frequency, and the
smaller peaks at multiples of the principal frequency, increase
in magnitude with each iteration. The transition region becomes steeper with each iteration.
Hiller et al. [HDK01] report that Lloyd’s relaxation results
in an increased anisotropy, but the anisotropy graphs do not
support that claim, or the increase is not significant. It is possible that Lloyd’s relaxation, after many iterations, finds the
global minimum (a hexagonal grid), and that the Poisson disk
distribution regains periodicity. We have seen this happening
for smaller distributions, but for larger distributions this does

However, as noted by Cohen et al. [CSHD03] and Lagae
and Dutr´e [LD05a], this approach is flawed. The constraints
of multiple tiles cause less points to be inserted near the edges
and corners. This results in a noticeable lower density of
points in those regions. The problem of multiple constraints
is more severe than it might seem at first sight: placing a point
near the corner of one tile makes it impossible, for at least
one corner of every other tile in the tile set, to have a point
nearby.
Although these problems limit the applicability of this
method, the idea of using Wang tiles for generating
Poisson disk distributions would later prove to be very
valuable.

8. Tiled Blue Noise Samples
In 2001, Hiller et al. [HDK01] presented an approach based
on Lloyd’s relaxation algorithm rather than dart throwing
to construct a Poisson disk distribution over a set of Wang
tiles.
Hiller et al. use a set of eight Wang tiles. An initial point
set is generated in the center of every tile. Each tile in the
set is surrounded by all possible configurations of 8 tiles. For
all of these configurations, a Voronoi diagram is constructed.
Each Voronoi diagram determines a displacement vector for

From the original data we computed radial statistics, which
were not listed in the original paper. Figure 10 shows the intraand inter-tile radius of the 63 tile sets. The intra-tile radius,
which is the radius of the Poisson disk distribution within a
single tile, is relatively high (ρ ≈ 0.80), as expected from an
approach based on Lloyd’s relaxation (Section 6). However,
the inter-tile radius, which is the radius of the Poisson disk
distribution taking into account neighbouring tiles, and thus
the final radius of the generated distribution, is relatively low
(often ρ ≈ 0.40 or even less). This shows that the low radius is
due to difficulties at the tile edges, which indicates problems
with the construction method. Figure 11 shows the intra and
inter tile radius versus the number of relaxation iterations for
two tile sets. As expected, the intra-tile radius converges to an
relative radius of about 0.80. The inter-tile radius, however,
does not seem to converge.
Figure 12 shows power spectra of Poisson disk distributions generated with the method of Hiller et al. Compared to
the previous methods we have discussed, the power spectra
are relatively bad. In Section 11, however, we will see that
eight tiles is not enough for generating Poisson disk distributions with good spectral properties. Furthermore, the algorithm most likely is not capable of handling larger tile sets.
Even with eight tiles, the number of eight-tile configurations
is so large that the displacement vectors tend to average each
other out.

We also suspect that due to the construction method and
convergence problems, the point density along the tile edges
is lower than in the center of the tiles, but we have no hard
evidence supporting this claim.
The method of Hiller et al. was later adopted in the paper
of Cohen et al. [CSHD03], a paper that popularized Wang
tiles in the field of computer graphics.
9. Fast Hierarchical Importance Sampling with Blue
Noise Properties
In 2004, Ostromoukhov et al. [ODJ04] presented an interesting technique for generating point distributions with blue
noise properties over a given density.
The points are placed on the vertices of a Penrose tiling
[Pen74, GS86], recursively subdivided according to a given
density. The point distribution is optimized by moving
the points according to pre-computed displacement vectors

The radius of the point distributions generated over a constant density is comparable with dart throwing. The relative
radii we have measured varied between 0.65 and 0.75.
Because multiple runs of the code produce the same point
distribution, it is not possible to compute a power spectrum estimate. Instead, Figure 13 shows the periodogram of a Poisson

10. Edge-Based Poisson Disk Tiles
In 2005, Lagae and Dutr´e [LD05a] presented a procedural object distribution function, a new texture-basis function. This
application required Poisson disk distribution with a large radius, meaning the approach of Hiller et al. could not be used.
Lagae and Dutr´e presented a new kind of Poisson disk tiles
which they call edge based Poisson disk tiles.
Edge-based Poisson disk tiles are constructed over a complete set of Wang tiles. A complete set of Wang tiles contains
all possible combinations of edge colours. A complete Wang
tile set over C colours consists of C4 tiles.
The construction method follows from a study of the different regions in a tile. Three kinds of regions in a tile are
identified: edge regions, corner regions and an interior region.
These regions determine a dual tiling. The dual tiling uses
three kinds of tiles: edge tiles, which correspond to the union
of edge regions of neighboring Wang tiles corner tiles, which

do not have as many points in common as template Poisson
disk tiles (Section 8). However, there are some strange wavelike artefacts in the spectra that we cannot explain. In Section
11 however, we will see that 4096 tiles is enough but way
too much for generating Poisson disk distributions with good
spectral properties.

correspond to the union of the corner regions of four neighboring Wang tiles, and interior tiles, which correspond to the
interior region of the Wang tiles.
For a complete set of Wang tiles over C colours, there are
C horizontal and C vertical edge tiles, one for each colours,
C4 corner tiles because a corner tile is determined by four
edge tiles, and C12 interior tiles, because an interior tile is
determined by four corner tiles or 12 edges.
Poisson disk distributions are generated over, respectively,
the edge tiles, the corner tiles and the interior tiles. Then
the Poisson disk tiles are constructed from parts of these
tiles.
A Poisson disk tile set based on a complete Wang tile set
over C colour, will contain C12 tiles. For C = 2, this comes
down to 4096 tiles. This is the only practical choice for the
number of colour, as C = 1 results in a single toroidal tile,
and C = 3 produces over half a million tiles. Note that, the
Poisson disk tile set does not contain C4 tiles. This is because
corner tiles take into account the colours of all their incident
edge tiles. For more details, we refer to [LD05a].
Figures 14 shows power spectra of Poisson disk distributions generated with edge-based Poisson disk tiles. In contrast
with previous methods, the relative radius of the Poisson disk
distributions generated with this approach is high (a relative
radius up to 0.85). Compared to the previous methods we
discussed, the power spectra are relatively good. The power
spectra are closer to the reference power spectra, and the magnitude of the peaks is smaller than those of template Poisson
disk tiles (Section 11) and tiled blue noise samples (Section
8). This is because more tiles are used and because the tiles

In 2005, Lagae and Dutr´e [LD05b] also presented template
Poisson disk tiles, a very simple tile-based approach. A set
of template Poisson disk tiles is a set of square tiles that
share the same toroidal boundary of points. Once a set of
template Poisson disk tiles is constructed, a tiled Poisson
disk distribution can be generated by placing tiles chosen
randomly from the tile set next to each other.
A template Poisson disk tile set is constructed by choosing
the size of the tile set, the number of points per tile, and the
radius of the Poisson disk distribution.
A single tile, called the master tile, is created by generating a toroidal Poisson disk distribution using relaxation
dart throwing optionally followed by Lloyd’s relaxation. This
process is repeated if the desired Poisson disk radius is not
reached.
A tiled Poisson disk distribution can be generated using
only the master tile, because the distribution it contains is
toroidal. However, there will be much repetition in the distribution, something that should be avoided.
To ensure that a Poisson disk distribution is continuous
over tile edges, only points closer to an edge of the tile than
the Poisson disk radius need to be considered. Thus, a single
tile template can be created by discarding all points in the
interior of the master tile.
The remaining tiles in the tile set are created by filling
the tile template with a Poisson disk distribution that brings
the total number of points in the tile to the chosen number
of points per tile. Again, this distribution is generated using relaxation dart throwing optionally followed by Lloyd’s
relaxation. However, no new points are added to the tile template, and during relaxation, points are prohibited to enter the
tile template. This is done by clipping displacement vectors
of points that are about to enter the tile template. For more
details, we refer to [LD05b].
The major advantages of template Poisson disk tiles is
that there are no constraints on the size of the tile set and
the number of points per tile. This allows to investigate the
effect of these parameters on the spectrum of the tiled Poisson disk distributions. Figure 15 shows the power spectrum
of tiled Poisson disk distributions generated with template
Poisson disk tile sets, for a variety of parameters. In general,

of 0.75 for template Poisson disk tile sets with 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 and 256 tiles and 16,24,32,48,64,96 and 128 points per tile.
for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 tiles are rather bad, while spectra for
a larger tile set size and number of points per tile are rather
good. Therefore it is recommended to use at least 32 or more
points per tile and 32 or more tiles. We believe these results
generalize to other kinds of Poisson disk tiles, and explain
why the power spectrum of tiled blue noise samples (Section
8) is rather bad.
Figure 16 shows more detailed power spectra of tiled Poisson disk distributions generated with template Poisson disk
tiles. The major difference between the spectrum of a tiled
Poisson disk distribution and a non-tiled Poisson disk distribution is that the spectrum of a tiled Poisson disk distribution
contains a grid-like pattern of spikes. This effect is most easily
explained in terms of autocorrelation. The autocorrelation is
related to the power spectrum through the Wiener–Khinchin
Theorem. Because only a limited number of tiles are used, the
autocorrelation peaks for lags that are a multiple of the tile

size. In the power spectrum, this results in a grid-like pattern
of peaks on frequencies that are a multiple of the reciprocal of
the tile size. When using more tiles, the spikes will decrease
in magnitude. However, because only a finite number of tiles
is used, it is impossible to eliminate them completely. Note
that this effect is not limited to template Poisson disk tiles.
The grid is visible in all methods that are based on a square
tessellation, including tiled blue noise samples (Section 8),
template Poisson disk tiles (Section 11), edge-based Poisson
disk tiles (Section 10), corner-based Poisson disk tiles (Section 12), and recursive Wang tiles (Section 13). For template
Poisson disk tiles, another factor that contributes to the peaks
is the fact that all tiles in the tile set have a number of points
in common, namely the points in the tile template, which are
replicated periodically when generating a tiled Poisson disk
distribution. These peaks also turn up in the radially averaged
power spectrum and anisotropy graphs.

Figure 17 shows the power spectrum of tiled Poisson disk
distributions generated with corner-based Poisson disk tile
sets, for a variety of parameters. These results confirm earlier
findings (Section 11). Starting from 3 colours (81 tiles) and
32 points per tile the spectra are rather good. The power
spectra of corner-based Poisson disk tiles are better than the
spectra of edge based Poisson disk tiles (Section 10), even
when using smaller tile sets.

Template Poisson disk tiles may not be suited for use in
applications. However, they allow to study the effect of the
size of the tile set and the number of points per tile on the
power spectrum, and help to better understand the spectral
characteristics of other tile based approaches.
12. Corner-Based Poisson Disk Tiles
In 2006, Lagae and Dutr´e [LD06a] presented an improved
version of their edge-based Poisson disk tiles, which we call
corner based Poisson disk tiles.
Corner-based Poisson disk tiles are constructed over a
complete set of corner tiles rather than Wang tiles. Corner
tiles are square tiles with coloured corners, similar to Wang
tiles. The tile construction method is very similar to edgebased Poisson disk tiles. For a set of tiles with coloured corners over C colours, there are C corner tiles, one for each
colour, and C2 horizontal and vertical edge tiles, because an
edge tile is determined by two corner tiles. Now, the corner
tiles rather than the edge tiles are constructed first. That is
why the tiles are called corner-based Poisson disk tiles. For
more details, we refer to [LD06a].
In contrast with edge-based Poisson disk tiles, cornerbased Poisson disk tile sets can be constructed for a variety
of tile set sizes. For C colours, an edge-based Poisson disk
tile set contains C12 tiles. The only practical choice for C is
2, which results in 4096 tiles. For C colours, a corner-based
Poisson disk tile set counts only C4 tiles, enabling tile sets of
16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401 and 4096 tiles. This solves the
problem of edge-based Poisson disk tiles having too many

Figures 18 shows that the peaks in power spectra generated
with corner-based Poisson disk tiles are much smaller than
those of edge-based Poisson disk tiles. The radially averaged
power spectrum is almost the same as that of non-tiled Poisson disk distributions. Although the anisotropy still contains
peaks, it is much smaller than the anisotropy of other Poisson
disk tiles.
There is an additional argument to choose corner-based
Poisson disk tiles over edge-based Poisson disk tiles.
Figure 19 plots the expected number of points in edge and
corner regions. The expected number of points in corner regions is constant, and much smaller than the expected number
of points in edge regions. Therefore, more variation in edge
tiles will produce a better power spectrum than more variation in corner tiles. For C = 2 colours, a set of edge-based
Poisson disk tiles consists of 4096 tiles and there are two
different edge tiles (and 16 different corner tiles). For C = 8
colours, a set of corner-based Poisson disk tiles also counts
4096 tiles, but there are 64 different edge tiles (and eight different corner tiles). This is an important reason why corner
based Poisson disk tiles produce better power spectra than
edge based Poisson disk tiles.
The time required to generate Poisson disk distributions of
approximately 16348 points using a tile set with four colours
and 32, 48 and 64 points per tile is, respectively, 0.088, 0.102
and 0.122 seconds. With six colours the time is respectively
0.238, 0.319 and 0.415 seconds, and with eight colours, the
time is respectively 0.629, 0.911 and 1.200 seconds. Most of
this time is used for loading the tile set stored in a text file in
memory.

13. Recursive Wang Tiles for Real-Time Blue Noise
In 2006, Kopf et al. [KCODL06] presented a method to generate Poisson disk distributions over a given density in real
time.
Kopf et al. use recursive Wang tiles that contain self-similar
and progressive Poisson disk distributions. The property of
self-similarity allows to increase the point density in large
steps by recursively subdividing the tile. A progressive point
distribution allows to smoothly adjust the density of points.
Combined, these two properties enable an algorithm for gen-

erating varying-density point distributions in real time. For
more details, we refer to [KCODL06]. A similar technique
is explored by Lagae and Dutr´e [LD06b].
The radius of the point distributions generated over a constant density is surprisingly low. Using the original tile set
of Kopf et al., we have measured relative radii between
0.44 and less than 0.001. Most distributions had a relative
radius of less than 0.001. The technique of Kopf et al. is
therefore not suited for applications requiring a large relative
radius.
Figure 20 shows the power spectrum of Poisson disk distribution generated with the approach of Kopf et al. Compared

to the previous techniques, the power spectrum rather bad.
The anisotropy is rather high.
The time required to generate a Poisson disk distribution
of approximately 16384 tiles is 1.005 seconds.

14. Conclusion
Poisson disk distributions are used frequently in computer
graphics. We have analysed different methods for generating Poisson disk distributions based on radial statistics and
spectral properties. These two measures were chosen because
they cover a wide range of applications.

Dart throwing, relaxation dart throwing and Lloyd’s relaxation can only be used for applications that are not interactive, and for applications that do not require large Poisson
disk distributions (roughly less than 100,000 points). The accelerated dart throwing algorithms of Jones and Dunbar and
Humphreys are suited for interactive applications, but they
are still relatively slow compared to tile-based approaches,
and if a large radius is required, must still be followed by
slow Lloyd’s relaxation iterations.

8 colours, 32, 48 and 64 points per tiles, and a relative radius
of 0.75.

For real-time applications, and applications that require
large Poisson disk distributions, tile-based approaches are the
only option. Shade’s approach has major shortcomings and
should not be used. We recommend not to use tiled blue noise
samples because the radius of the generated distributions is
low, and because the power spectrum is relatively bad. Edgebased Poisson disk tiles are better, both in terms of radius
and spectral properties. Template Poisson disk tiles are interesting from a theoretical point of view, but the toroidal tile
boundary introduces too many artefacts in the power spectrum. Corner-based Poisson disk tiles have several advantages
over edge based Poisson disk tiles. Corner-based Poisson disk
tiles produce better power spectra even with less tiles, and
allow to trade spectral quality for tile set size. Therefore, corner based Poisson disk tiles seems to be the best tile-based
approach.
The spectral properties of the method of Ostromoukhov
et al. and Kopf et al. are below average. The radius of the
Poisson disk distributions generated with the technique of
Kopf et al. is surprisingly low. The technique should not be
used for generating constant density Poisson disk distributions. However, the real power of these methods is that they
are capable of generating varying density point distributions.
In this paper, only constant density Poisson disk distributions
were investigated.

We would like to note that different applications often have
different requirements. For example, a large radius is very important for object distribution, while spectral properties may
not be that important. For sampling, spectral properties are
very important, and a slightly smaller radius will not matter that much. Radial statistics and spectral properties are
two very important criteria for analysing Poisson disk distributions. However, this does not mean that for a specific
application certain methods should be discarded a priori.
