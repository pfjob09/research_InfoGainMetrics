arbitrary domains

Abstract
In this paper we propose a new kind of Hermite interpolation on arbitrary domains, matching derivative data
of arbitrary order on the boundary. The basic idea stems from an interpretation of mean value interpolation
as the pointwise minimization of a radial energy function involving first derivatives of linear polynomials. We
generalize this and minimize over derivatives of polynomials of arbitrary odd degree. We analyze the cubic case,
which assumes first derivative boundary data and show that the minimization has a unique, infinitely smooth
solution with cubic precision. We have not been able to prove that the solution satisfies the Hermite interpolation
conditions but numerical examples strongly indicate that it does for a wide variety of planar domains and that it
behaves nicely.

1. Introduction
Mean value interpolation has emerged as a simple and robust way to smoothly interpolate a function defined on the
boundary of an arbitrary domain in Rn , and provides an
alternative to solving a PDE such as the Laplace equation. This kind of interpolation started from a generalization of barycentric coordinates in the plane [Flo03], and was
later extended to general polygons [HF06] and to triangular
meshes [FKR05, JSW05]. These constructions were further
generalized to continuous boundaries in [JSW05, SJW07].
More work on mean value coordinates and related topics
can be found in [Bel06,FHK06,FH07,JSWD05,LBS06,LKCOL07, WSHD07].
Mean value interpolation only matches the values of a
function on the boundary, not its derivatives. However, there
are many applications in geometric modeling and scientific
computing in which it is also desirable to match certain
derivatives at the boundary, and again it is worth looking
for methods that avoid solving a PDE such as the biharmonic equation. An early approach was that of Gordon and
Wixom [GW74], which is based on averaging the values of
interpolatory univariate polynomials across the domain. This

method is simple conceptually but only applies to convex
domains and requires computing intersections between lines
and the domain boundary.
A more recent approach to higher order interpolation by
Langer and Seidel [LS08] is an extension of barycentric
coordinates to incorporate derivative data given at a set of
vertices. Generalized barycentric coordinates such as Wachspress, Sibson, and mean value coordinates are composed
with a modifying function and then used to interpolate first
order Taylor expansions at the vertices. This method is easy
to compute and was applied successfully to give greater control when deforming polygonal meshes. However, even in
the univariate case this method lacks cubic precision.
Another recent idea, developed in [DF07, BF], was to
build on properties of the mean value weight function, i.e.,
the reciprocal of the denominator in the rational expression
for the interpolant, in order to construct C1 Hermite interpolants on arbitrary domains. This method has the advantage
that it reduces to cubic polynomial interpolation in the univariate case, and in R2 and R3 it can be evaluated approximately through explicit formulas for polygons and triangular

meshes. However, the method does not have cubic precision
in Rn for n > 1.
In this paper we propose a new kind of Hermite interpolation on arbitrary domains in Rn . The method has cubic precision for C1 boundary data for all n, and in R2 the method
appears to perform very well in practice. We start by viewing mean value interpolation as the pointwise minimization
of a radial energy function involving first derivatives of linear polynomials. We then generalize this to match boundary
derivatives up to order k by minimizing a radial energy function involving (k +1)-st derivatives of polynomials of degree
2k + 1. The case k = 0 is simply mean value interpolation.
We analyze the cubic case, k = 1, and show that the minimization has a unique solution which has cubic precision.
We cannot prove that the solution satisfies the Hermite interpolation conditions but numerical examples show that the
solution interpolates the derivative boundary data in R2 for
a wide variety of domain shapes.

2. A new look at mean value interpolation
We start by showing that mean value interpolation can be
expressed as the solution to a radial minimization problem.
2.1. Convex domains
Consider the case that Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded, open, convex
domain and that f : ∂Ω → R is a continuous function. For
any point x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) in Ω and any unit vector v in
the unit sphere S ⊂ Rn , let p(x, v) be the unique point of
intersection between the semi-infinite line {x + rv : r ≥ 0}
and the boundary ∂Ω; see Figure 1. Let ρ(x, v) be the Euclidean distance ρ(x, v) = p(x, v) − x . As developed in the
papers [Flo03,JSW05,DF07,BF], the mean value interpolant
g : Ω → R is given by the formula
f (p(x, v))
g(x) =
dv
S ρ(x, v)
Z
1
φ(x) =
dv,
S ρ(x, v)
Z

It was shown in [DF07,BF] that under mild conditions on the
shape of the boundary ∂Ω, the function g interpolates f when
f is continuous. Figure 2 shows two examples of the mean
value interpolant g on a circular domain. In previous papers,
g was derived from the mean value property of harmonic
functions. In this paper we take a different viewpoint in order
to generalize to Hermite interpolation. We claim that at a
fixed point x ∈ Ω, the value g(x) is the unique minimizer
a = g(x) of the local ‘energy’ function

2.2. Non-convex domains
An interpretation in terms of functional minimization can
also be made for non-convex domains. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an
open, not necessarily convex domain. Recall that the intersection between a line and a surface is said to be transversal if the line does not lie in the tangent space of the surface at the point of intersection. We will say that a unit vector v is transversal with respect to x in Ω if all the intersections between {x + rv : r ≥ 0} and ∂Ω are transversal.
For example, in the R2 case of Figure 3 all unit vectors are
transversal at x except for v1 and v2 . If v is transversal, let
µ(x, v) be the number of intersections of {x + rv : r ≥ 0}
with ∂Ω which will be an odd number, assumed finite, and
let p j (x, v), j = 1, 2, . . . , µ(x, v), be the points of intersection,
ordered so that their distances ρ j (x, v) = p j (x, v) − x are
increasing,

x

Figure 3: (a) Two non-transversal vectors. (b) A transversal
vector with three intersections.

Indeed, similar to the convex case, we find

ρ1 (x, v) < ρ2 (x, v) < · · · < ρµ(x,v) (x, v).
For example, for v in Figure 3b, there are three such intersections and so µ(x, v) = 3. We make the assumption that
the set {v ∈ S : v is non-transversal} has measure zero, so
that non-transversal v can be ignored when integrating over
S. The mean value interpolant [DF07, BF] is then

Having now recast mean value interpolation as the minimization of a radial energy function, we are ready to explore a possible generalization in which the interpolant also
matches derivative boundary data. Instead of minimizing
over first derivatives of linear polynomials, we now minimize over (k + 1)-st derivatives of polynomials of degree
2k + 1, for any k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Specifically, we want to interpolate in Ω a Ck continuous real function f , given its values
and partial derivatives up to order k at the boundary ∂Ω. Fix
x ∈ Ω and let τ be some polynomial in πk (Rn ), the linear
space of n-variate polynomials of degree ≤ k. We think of
τ as its own Taylor series at x because we are only interested in the derivatives of τ up to order k at x. Then, for each
transversal v ∈ S and for j = 1, . . . , µ(x, v), let qv, j be the

1508

univariate polynomial of degree ≤ 2k + 1 such that
(i)
qv, j (0) = Div τ(x),

Then, Ev, j and E can be viewed as functions of a and b, and
the task is to find a ∈ R and b ∈ Rn to minimize

This procedure defines, in a pointwise fashion, a function
g : Ω → R. In general, the minimization will yield a different polynomial τ at each x and so g will not itself be a
polynomial.
Several questions arise, the main ones being
1. does the minimization have a unique solution τ, so that g
is well-defined, and
2. do the derivatives of g up to order k match those of f on
∂Ω?
Considering first the univariate case, n = 1, it is well
known that among all piecewise Ck+1 functions q on a real
interval (a, b) that match derivatives up to order k of a given
function f at a and b, the unique minimizer of the energy

is the polynomial Hermite interpolant to f of degree at most
2k + 1. Thus when n = 1 and Ω = (a, b), we see that g, defined by (1), will simply be the Hermite polynomial interpolant to f of degree ≤ 2k + 1. Thus the answer to both
questions is ‘yes’ when n = 1. We are not able to answer
them for general n, however. Instead, in the rest of the paper, we focus on the case k = 1 and we show that there is a
unique minimizer for all n. We cannot yet show that g really
interpolates the derivatives of f of order 0 and 1, but we can
show that if f is a cubic then g = f , in which case it trivially
interpolates, and numerical examples in R2 strongly suggest
that it interpolates any f when n = 2.
In the case k = 1, we can express any polynomial τ ∈
π1 (Rn ) in the form

We can now apply Lemma 1 to give a formula for
Ev, j (a, b) in (3), using matrix notation. Setting f0 = a, m0 =

Proof We first show that aT Ma ≥ 0. To do this, let f = 0.
Then since N = 0 and P = 0, we have
aT Ma = E(a).
Since

and similarly for N and P, and integrating a matrix means
integrating each element. As the set of non-transversal v has
measure zero for each x ∈ Ω, the integration can be achieved
by splitting the integral into a sum over integrals over the regions of S where the number of intersections µ(x, v) is constant.
The matrix M is clearly symmetric and if it is also positive
definite then it is non-singular and the unique minimum of
E is the unique solution a to the equation

If a parametric representation of ∂Ω is available, the integrals
in M and N in (6) can be converted to integrals over the parameters of ∂Ω, in the spirit of [JSW05]. To this end, suppose
that s = (s1 , . . . , sn−1 ) : D → ∂Ω is a parameterization of the
curve or surface ∂Ω with parameter domain D ⊂ Rn−1 . We
will assume that s is a regular parameterization, by which
we mean that s is piecewise C1 and that at every point of
differentiability t = (t1 , . . . ,tn−1 ) ∈ D, the first order partial
derivatives Di s := ∂s/∂ti , i = 1, 2, . . . , n−1, are linearly independent. Thus, following the notation of [JSW05] and [BF],
their cross product,
s⊥ (t) := det(D1 s(t), . . . , Dn−1 s(t))
is non-zero, and is orthogonal to the tangent space at s(t).
We make the convention that s⊥ points outwards from Ω.
Then, considering for example the integrals in M in (7), we
make the substitution p j (x, v) = s(t) in (7), so that
v=

s(t) − x
,
s(t) − x

and ρ j (x, v) = s(t) − x , and then (see [BF]),
dv =

(s(t) − x) · s⊥ (t)
dt.
s(t) − x n

Substituting these expressions into (7), and similarly for N,
gives the boundary representations

This provides a way of numerically computing the value of g
at a point x by sampling the surface s and its first derivatives
and applying numerical integration. It also shows that g is
C∞ smooth in Ω, due to differentiation under the integral
sign.
5. Cubic precision
We now establish cubic precision (for k = 1 and all n):
Theorem 2 Suppose that f : Ω → R is a cubic polynomial.
Then g = f in Ω.
Proof Fix an arbitrary x ∈ Ω and let aˆ := f (x) and bˆ :=
ˆ ≤ E(a, b) for all a ∈ R
∇ f (x). We will show that E(a,
ˆ b)
and b ∈ Rn and hence g(x) = aˆ = f (x).
Let ev, j : [0, ρ j (x, v)] → R be the cubic polynomial defined
by ev, j (r) = qv, j (r) − f (x + rv). Then
qv, j (r) =

6. Numerical Examples
We conclude the paper with some numerical examples of the
minimizing C1 Hermite interpolant g in R2 . All of these examples were computed using Cramer’s rule to find the value
of a in (8). The elements of M and N were found using the
boundary formula (10) and adaptive numerical integration
with a relative tolerance.
Figure 4 shows g on the unit disk in the case that f (x, y) =
r2 sin 2θ, with polar coordinates x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ.
As predicted by Theorem 2, g is numerically equal to f in
this case, since f is the quadratic polynomial f (x, y) = 2xy.
In this example, the Hermite interpolant g is only slightly
different to the mean value interpolant to the Lagrange data
from f shown in Figure 2.
Figure 5 shows g on a non-convex domain with a hole,

part of the figure shows g on the top and its error function
at the bottom. Note that both error functions are tangentially
zero at the boundary.
In Figure 7 we use the interpolant for hole filling, with a
circular hole, and with f (x, y) = cos r. In the top f is shown
together with the boundary of the hole that is cut out. Then
the Hermite interpolant of [DF07] is shown, and at the bottom the minimizing interpolant g.
Figure 8 shows another example of the nice behaviour of
