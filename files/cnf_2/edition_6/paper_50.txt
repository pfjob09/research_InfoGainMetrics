Abstract
The human shoulder complex is perhaps the most complicated joint in the human body being comprised of a set
of three bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Despite this anatomical complexity, computer graphics models
for motion capture most often represent this joint as a simple ball and socket. In this paper, we present a method
to determine a shoulder skeletal model that, when combined with standard skinning algorithms, generates a more
visually pleasing animation that is a closer approximation to the actual skin deformations of the human body.
We use a data-driven approach and collect ground truth skin deformation data with an optical motion capture
system with a large number of markers (200 markers on the shoulder complex alone). We cluster these markers
during movement sequences and discover that adding one extra joint around the shoulder improves the resulting
animation qualitatively and quantitatively yielding a marker set of approximately 70 markers for the complete
skeleton. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our skeletal model by comparing it with ground truth data as well as
with recorded video. We show its practicality by integrating it with the conventional rendering/animation pipeline.

There have been various approaches to reduce the gap
between human shoulder deformations and those created
in computer graphics. In particular, there has been a great
deal of work in skinning algorithms aimed at volume preservation [MG03, KZ05, WPP07, RHC09] as well as detailed
anatomical models [SPCM97, NT00, ZCCD04, PCLS05,
LST09]. In this paper, we approach this problem by learning the structure of the shoulder from data. We collect the
data using densely spaced surface markers and reconstruct
the mesh surface with the technique presented by Park and
Hodgins [PH06]. From these example poses, we determine
the appropriate skeletal structure including the number of
joints and the position of each joint. We integrate this new
skeletal structure into a traditional motion capture and rendering pipeline by identifying a small number of markers
(four/segment) which approximate the motion of the skeleton generated from the dense marker set and estimating the
skin weight of each vertex on a high resolution mesh with
respect to the computed skeleton. We compare our results to
video of the capture session and quantitatively to the mesh
created from the dense marker set.

1. Introduction
The shoulder complex is one of the most complicated joints
in the human skeletal structure as it consists of three bones:
the clavicle, the scapula and the humerus, as well as their
associated muscles, tendons and ligaments. The shoulder
bones form three synovial joints: the sternoclavicular (SC)
joint, the acromioclavicular (AC) joint and the glenohumeral
(GH) joint. The combination of these joints allows the shoulder complex to have both a very wide range of motion and
subtle internal movements such as a shrug [vdH97].
Unlike the complexity of the anatomical shoulder mechanism, animated characters often have shoulders that are
modeled as a single ball and socket joint. The shoulder joint
is defined as three rotational degrees of freedom between
two bones, one attached to the spine and the other representing the upper arm. This discrepancy between the complexity
of anatomical system and the simple animated model impacts the quality of the resulting animation, especially when
the motion is rendered on a full human figure with a skinned
surface.

Q.Hong, S.Park and J.Hodgins / A Data-driven Segmentation for the Shoulder Complex

Our main contribution is a new skeletal model which
reduces artifacts and creates more visually pleasing motions
for the shoulder in animation rendered in the conventional capture/animation/rendering pipeline. Although
our model is not anatomically based, it is data-driven
and therefore provides a good match to the actual deformations seen in the skin and muscle around the
shoulder. We further contribute to the literature by placing
our collected data and model parameters on the web
(http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/shoulder)
for others to use in their captures or research.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the
next section, we describe the existing research in skin deformation and techniques for constructing the skeletal structure
based on data. Section 3 describes our approach: collecting
data and then determining the skeleton and skin weights. In
section 4, the experimental results are presented. The limitations and future work are discussed in section 5.
2. Background
Skeleton-driven techniques are the prevalent techniques for
generating human character animation. The most popular
method is skeleton subspace deformation or skinning, in
which each vertex on the skin surface is connected to underlying bones with proper weight values. The position of
the vertices are determined by the connected bones as described by Lewis and his colleagues [LCF00]. Most commercial animation tools such as 3ds Max and Maya support
this method, and we use this approach to render our final results. However, a simple implementation of this method suffers from artifacts such as the “collapsing-elbow” and the
“candy-wrapper” effect (described in [LCF00]). Many recent research efforts have been aimed at overcoming these
problems through the use of more sophisticated models or
by carefully determining the parameters and coefficients of
the method based on the examples.
The improved models include such techniques as changing the interpolation scheme [KZ05], using swept ellipsoids
for approximating the model [HYC∗ 05], mimicking the volume effects of muscles and fat by adding deformable geometries under the skin [GW05], building a simple anatomical
model from the outside in [PCLS05], and applying a postprocessed volume correction [RHC09].
The second approach uses sample skin data in various
poses as a training set and determines a more accurate set
of parameters. Our work falls into this class of approaches
in that we use an optimization framework to find an additional joint. Mohr and Gleicher add extra joints in the region of complex deformation observed in the data [MG03].
The number of extra joints and their positions were determined by the user. The movement of the extra joints is inferred from the neighboring joints rather than captured directly. Wang and Phillips also use sample surface data to determine the skinning parameters [WP02]. However, rather

than modifying the skeletal structure, they break down the
single weight value for a bone into 12 sub-weight values,
where each corresponds to a component of the transformation matrix of a bone. Similar to Wang and Phillips’ method,
Merry and his colleagues present a method called animation space, in which a vertex has 4 sub-weight values for
a bone [MMG06]. Park and Hodgins model dynamic skin
deformation based on captured skin data [PH08]. They focus on representing the non-linearity of the skin deformation
given the skeletal structure while here we present a method
to find an effective skeletal structure when the skinning algorithm is given.
Recently, mesh animation data has become more readily
available with new surface acquisition methods. Using mesh
animation data is not easy due primarily to the difficulty
of editing such a large unstructured dataset. One solution
is to convert the surface data into skeleton-based skinned
data. James and Twigg suggested a method for representing mesh animation as a set of near-rigid objects based on
the mean-shift segmentation method [JT05]. Anguelov and
his colleagues compute a skeletal structure from a set of 3D
scanned surface data [ASK∗ 05], and de Aguiar and his colleagues compute it from mesh animation [dATTS08]. We
basically follow those approaches in estimating the skeletal
structure and add an automatic method for determining the
number of bones and joint locations.
3. Approach
Our algorithm for computing a skeletal model and the skinning weights has five steps: database construction, rigid segmentation, skeleton extraction, marker selection and skin
weight computation. We now describe those steps in detail.
3.1. Database Construction
We build a database of captured skin surfaces around the
shoulder area from a variety of poses. There have been
many methods developed for this purpose including scanners [ACP02, ASK∗ 05] and optical motion capture devices
[SMP03, PH06]. We use an optical motion capture system

for capturing the surface because the optical motion capture allows us to capture motion rather than just poses. We
use a Vicon commercial motion capture system consisting
of 16 near infra-red cameras at a rate of 120 frames/sec and
place approximately 200 markers on the subject’s shoulder
area (Figure 1(a)). The markers are positioned with approximately a 1 inch spacing.
In order to cover the deformation space of the shoulder effectively, we captured a variety of motions including a rangeof-motion exercise, stretching, and golfing. We divide the
motion into a training set and a testing set (Table 1). The
captured data are represented as marker trajectories. Markers which are missing due to occlusions are filled in using
the method of Park and Hodgins [PH06]. In this technique a
triangular mesh is constructed and used to identify the neighboring markers based on the connectivity embedded in the
mesh (Figure 1(b)). The motion of the neighbors is used to
reconstruct the position of an occluded marker.
3.2. Rigid Segmentation
The conventional skinning process for a virtual character is
a process of approximating the deformation of the human
body as an articulated set of rigid bodies. Thus, for effective
skinning, the character surface should be divided in such a
way that its deformation space is modeled well. In this work,
we achieve this segmentation by finding sets of triangles
from the marker surface that move together in the marker
mesh animation. Thus, we transform the problem of rigid
segmentation into a clustering problem.
Inspired by the work of James and Twigg [JT05], we cluster the triangles on a marker surface based on the rotational
displacement of each triangle because the triangles have the
same rotational displacement during rigid transformations.
Given a time instance t, the rotational displacement of the
i-th triangle is represented as a unit-quaternion qti ∈ SO3 ,
which is computed by finding the absolute orientation by
solving a least-squares problem [Hor87]. In clustering, our
T

feature vector for the i-th triangle is Fi = v1i v2i · · · vTi ,
where T is the total number of frames in the training set and
vti ∈ R3 is the rotational displacement vector corresponding
to qti computed by the logarithm map [LS02]. By using vti
instead of qti , we assume that two rotational changes are similar if their corresponding displacement vectors are close in
the Eulerian space.

segments; (c) five segments; (d) six segments.

Many methods have been proposed for clustering. For example, mean shift is used by James and Twigg [JT05] for a
similar purpose. However, in our case, the number of clusters
is finite and small. Therefore, we test all reasonable candidate number of clusters using standard K-means clustering.
We choose three as the smallest number to test because it is
comparable to the common skeletal structure used in games
consisting of the right chest, the upper arm, and the lower
arm. The largest number we test is six, which we believe
is the maximum number that makes sense for rigging. We
test each integer value, and evaluate how many clusters are
needed. Because the clustering result from K-means is sensitive to the choice of the initial guesses for the cluster centers, we use a randomized approach: we repeat the clustering many times (1000 times) with a random initial seed and
choose the best. We measure the quality of the clustering by
summing the distance between feature vectors and their cluster center. On an Intel R CoreTM 2 CPU at 2.66GHz, it takes
less than 30 minutes to execute the K-mean algorithm 1000
times.
Figure 2 shows our segmentation results with a varying number of segments. In the three segment result (Figure 2(a)), the segmentation matches the conventional skeletal
structure. The result with four segments reveals the shoulder
area as a separate segment (Figure 2(b)). Five segments refines the shoulder area more (Figure 2(c)). The additional
segment provided by six clusters appears around the tip of
the wrist and does not contribute to the shoulder refinement.
3.3. Skeleton Extraction
After segmentation, we optimize the skeletal structure. Each
segment represents a bone in the skeleton. We assume that
our skeletal structure branches from the spine around the upper chest and forms a single chain until the wrist joint. This

assumption does not have an anatomical basis. However, the
number of segments we choose is too small to build a complex skeletal structure. More importantly, this single chain
assumption makes the skeleton easy to build, which is crucial for a practical animation pipeline. We set each joint between two adjacent bones as a 3 degree-of-freedom (dof) rotational ball joint for generality. Based on this assumption,
defining the skeletal structure is dependent on determining
the joint location.
A ball joint between two adjacent bones can be found as a
fixed point on one bone which also remains stationary across
time when described in the other bone’s local coordinate
system. We employ the optimization method presented by
Anguelov and colleagues [AKP∗ 04], which models computation of the joint location as a weighted linear regression.

where er is the deviation value of a marker, pt is the captured
position of the marker at time t, Tt is the computed transformation of the segment, and pˆ is the position of the marker at
a reference instance.
To enforce the second condition, we define a distance energy ed of a marker such that ed increases when the distance
between the marker and any selected representative markers is reduced and goes to zero when the distance value is
greater than a predefined threshold, that is
Ns

In the conventional motion capture pipeline, a minimal set of
markers are used to generate the kinematic constraints of the
bones and therefore determine their movement. The number
of markers required to sufficiently constrain a bone depends
on the type of joint. However, four markers for each segment is enough to solve for either three dof or six dof joints.
Based on an analysis of the data from the dense marker set,
we provide a method to guide the placement of the small
number of markers so that the rigid motion of a segment can
be computed for a new motion.
We choose those representative markers based on two
conditions: the selected markers should show a similar transformation to that of the associated segment (computed from
the dense marker set) and the distance between the selected
markers should be sufficient to prevent any confusion in the
motion capture process. We measure how a marker satisfies
the first condition by the deviation of its real position from

d(p,

where Ns is the number of existing representative markers,
pˆ i is the position of the i-th selected marker, and d(·, ·) is a

In our experiment, we assign dt as one fourth of the longest
distance between any two markers on the segment.
Putting these two conditions together, we choose the representative markers to have the minimal energy value e =
ω × er + (1 − ω) × ed , where ω is the weight between those
two policies (0.5 in our experiments). Markers are chosen
independently for each cluster using a greedy algorithm: after computing the energy value for each marker, we pick the
marker with the lowest value. Then, we repeat this process
until we have selected four markers. The first marker of a
segment is selected solely based on its er value. Figure 4
shows the representative markers for four clusters.
3.5. Skin Weight Computation
Given the new skeletal model, the final process is to bind a
detailed surface model for rendering to the skeleton by assigning weight values to each of the vertices. We call this

surface the detailed surface model in order to avoid confusion with the marker surface. When the detailed surface
model is animated, the rendered results depend heavily on
the skin weight values. In industry, skilled artists assign the
weight values manually. In our work, we automatically assign the weight values of the detailed surface. To compute
the skin weights of the detailed surface, we first compute the
weight values for the vertices on the marker surface. We exploit the method of Park and Hodgins [PH06]: the weight
values of vertices inside the segment are only dependent on
the segment and the weight values of vertices in the boundaries between neighboring segments are dependent on the
likelihood that a vertex belongs to each segment, which is
computed from the distance between the captured vertex and
vertex rigidly deformed by each segment. After computing
the weight values for the vertices, we transfer the weight values of the vertices to the detailed surface by registering the
detailed surface onto the marker surface and then by applying barycentric interpolation to the weight values.

4. Results
The primary purpose of this work is to determine an effective
skeletal configuration for the shoulder in a standard motion
capture animation pipeline. We have tested skeletal structures with varying number of segments. Table 2 shows the
errors for the synthesized motion.
For evaluation purposes, we use the marker surface as a
skin to be animated by the skeleton. The surface is deformed
along with the movement of the skeleton by using a standard
skinning algorithm for single weight enveloping. Weight values used in the skinning algorithm are computed from our
skeletal model. The joint angles of the skeleton are computed
either using the dense marker set or the reduced marker set.
We measure the quality of the skeletal model by comparing the positions between deformed vertices and their corresponding captured markers. Figure 5 summarizes the reconstruction error for the training set. The values shown in the
graph are the average error values over the whole sequence
of the training data as well as over all the markers. In the
three segment model (most similar to the conventional skeletal model), there exist larger errors. However, adding one
more segment around the shoulder as shown in the four segment model greatly reduces the error values. Interestingly,
adding more segments does not improve the error values further. The graph also shows the effectiveness of our marker
selection (red line). Although the skeletal motion estimated
using the dense marker set shows consistently better results
than the reduced marker set, the global tendency over the
number of clusters is consistent.
We also synthesize the marker surface data for the test motion and measure the errors for the dense and reduced marker
sets (Figure 6 and Figure 7). The size of the error is dependent on the type of motion but the error values show similar

trends. We conclude that inserting one additional segment
between the chest and the upper arm greatly improves the
representation of the shoulder but that adding additional segments does not further improve the quality.
Figure 8 shows a screen shot of the results for reconstructing the training set when the different estimated skeletal models are used to animate a detailed surface. Because of
the small number of degrees of freedom, the three segment
model has a shrinking shoulder when the actor stretches his
arm forward. The four and five segment models look similar,
and they appear to conserve volume. They also better match
the photo of Figure 8(d). Figure 8(e) shows the comparison
between the three segment model (red) and the four segment
model (blue), in which the shrinking of the three segment
model is obvious. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 8(f),
the four segment model (blue) agrees closely with that of the

five segment model (green). Figure 9 and Figure 10 illustrate
the results when the models are applied to the test motion.
The four segment model is visually superior to the three segment model but adding additional segments does not show
much further improvement.
We apply our suggested four segment shoulder model to
a full body character and compare it with the three segment shoulder model. We first adopt a conventional full
body skeletal model and adjust its upper body to include the
extra shoulder segment. The test motions are captured using 69 optical markers, with the markers on the chest, the
shoulders and the arms placed at the positions suggested by
our method. We also transfer the skin weight values of the
shoulder area obtained in section 3.5 to the full body surface
model by aligning the shoulder-only surface onto the full
body surface. Figure 11 shows the comparison results between the two skeletal models. The artifact of the collapsing
shoulder is alleviated by our model.
Finally, we compare our method with the skinning method
proposed by Mohr and Gleicher [MG03], in which they

method, we use the four segment model built from the reduced marker set, whereas for testing their method, we use
the three segment model and add an extra joint to the shoulder joint, assigning a halfway interpolated angle to the added
joint. The weight values in each model are computed by folc 2010 The Author(s)

not provide further improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing with ground truth data
as well as with recorded video. We also show its practicality

method. The comparison results show that our method yields
the smaller average error per marker, especially for golfing
and jumping jacks.
5. Discussion
We propose a new shoulder model which creates a visually
more pleasing skin surface when combined with standard
skinning algorithms. The new model is data-driven and approximates the skin surface data captured with an optical
motion capture system. We discover that adding one extra

Our method has certain limitations. Because we use a
data-driven approach, the results are inherently subjectspecific, that is, the provided guideline in this paper is most
effective when applied to an animated subject having a similar body type to that of our human test subject. It is possible
that a different body segmentation would provide better results for different body types. We would like to explore more
body types and possible generalization between body types.
Our results are also dependent on the choice of the training motion. We choose a range of motion exercise as the
training set. Because our optimization method relies on a
least-squares framework, the results can be biased by many
frames of similar poses. We can overcome this problem by
selecting only distinct poses from the examples and making
sure that our data include all common shoulder poses.
We assume that the skeletal structure from the clavicle to the arm forms a single chain structure without any
branches. The method of using the minimum spanning tree
in [OBBH00] could be a good alternative for determining
the skeletal hierarchy in general.
We chose to study the shoulder complex because it often creates problems in capturing and skinning of realistic

sophisticated models than the conventional skeletal model.
For example, a twisting forearm shows the candy-wrapper
artifact in the conventional skeleton. In this case, the simple
