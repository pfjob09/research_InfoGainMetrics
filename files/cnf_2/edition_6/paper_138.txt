Abstract
Light transport is often characterized within a high-dimensional space although practitioners have long known
that it commonly behaves as a much lower-dimensional phenomenon. We study the effective dimension of light
transport over a neighborhood on the scene manifold and show that under plausible assumptions the dimensionality
is characterized by the spectrum of the spatio-spectral concentration problem. This allows us to improve existing
estimates for the dimension in computer graphics using a more insightful derivation and for the first time we obtain
optimal representations. The relevance of our results for existing rendering applications is discussed.

1. Introduction
In many applications the light transport problem must be
solved not at a single location but over a neighborhood on
the scene manifold. We study the local structure of light
transport and characterize the coherence of the computations
dependent on the neighborhood and the signal complexity.
Consider a radially symmetric transport operator T with
axis c(x), mapping distant incident radiance E(ω) to exitant
radiance B(x),
E(ω) T (c(x) · ω) dω.

For T being bandlimited in the Spherical Harmonics domain,
we determine optimal linear K-term approximations T˜ such

original size M of the problem much larger than K, the error
in Eq. 2 becomes vanishingly small. K will then be referred
to as the effective dimension and K/M provides a measure
for the coherence of light transport in the neighborhood U .

The above assumptions on T are satisfied for example
by the diffuse shading kernel (n(x) · ω) where the axis of
symmetry is the local normal n(x) and L = 2 [RH02]. Specular transport can be studied with our framework when only
˜ is of interest, in which case
a single outgoing direction ω
˜ and the Spherical Harmonics representation
B(x) = B(x, ω),

The local coherence of light transport has been exploited
in precomputed radiance transfer for some time [SHHS03,
LSSS04]. A theoretical analysis was recently undertaken by
Mahajan et al. [MSRB07]. There, the problem was considered in flatland and results were obtained by estimating the
spectrum of a discretized transport operator using a varia-

is restricted to a bandlimit L, chosen in accordance with the
application of interest. We will analyze partial occlusion by
assuming that the lighting is also radially symmetric.

tion of Szegö’s eigenvalue theorem. The extension to three
dimensions was sketched by these authors. Using the same
assumptions as Mahajan et al. [MSRB07], we study the effective dimension of light transport by reducing Eq. 2 to the
spatio-spectral concentration problem on the sphere, obtaining a derivation which provides greater insight and improves
their results [MSRB07].
In Sec. 2 an introduction to spatio-spectral concentration
theory will be presented and in Sec. 3 we study the effective
dimension of light transport. We conclude with a discussion
of our results and their relevance for practical settings.
2. Spatio-Spectral Concentration on the Sphere
Let H≤L (S 2 ) be the (L + 1)2 -dimensional space of L-bandlimited functions on the two-sphere S 2 . Legendre Spherical
Harmonics ylm (ω) afford in many applications an effective
representation for H≤L . For signals localized in a region U ⊂
S 2 , however, these are inefficient. Slepian functions provide
in this case optimal L-bandlimited representations with K
(L +1)2 basis functions. The complete set of (L + 1)2 Slepian
functions is additionally orthogonal over U and orthonormal
over S 2 , thus providing an alternative basis for H≤L .
Slepian functions gi are the solution to the spatio-spectral
concentration problem on the sphere [SDW06, SHB09]. Let
λi =

be a measure for the concentration of the L-bandlimited function gi ∈ H≤L in an arbitrary but fixed region U ⊂ S 2 . By the
Fourier uncertainty principle on the sphere [FGS98, Theorem
5.5.1] no bandlimited function in H≤L can be localized on
a subset of the sphere. Hence λi < 1. Functions gi ∈ H≤L
which are optimally localized according to Eq. 3 are given by
the eigenfunctions of the integral equation

ator D(ω
n = (L + 1)2 eigenvalues 1 > λ1 ≥ . . . ≥ λn > 0 and the associated eigenfunctions gi can be chosen to be orthogonal. The
first eigenfunction g1 is the L-bandlimited function which is
optimally concentrated in U and by construction its localization is λ1 . Subsequent eigenfunctions gi are the maximally
concentrated functions in H≤L orthogonal to all g j with j < i.
Of practical interest is the number K of Slepian functions
which is needed to accurately represent a signal localized
in U ⊂ S 2 . It follows from the definition of the concentration measure in Eq. 3 that basis functions gi with very small
eigenvalues |λi | ≈ 0 practically vanish over U and their contribution to a representation of a U-localized signal is negligible. An accurate approximation can hence be obtained
by considering only Slepian functions gi whose eigenvalues λi differ significantly from zero. The magnitude of the
eigenvalues is described by the localization spectrum of the
spatio-spectral concentration problem. For the real line it has
been shown [Sle65, Lan65, LW80] that the number N(ε) of
eigenvalues greater than ε > 0 satisfies

sufficiently large region C˜ the first term is dominant and it proc 2010 The Author(s)

eigenvalues. For small C˜ both the first and the second term
have to be considered. Unfortunately, for the sphere no results
analogous to Eq. 5 have been established to date. However,
the analogy to Eq. 5 and a setting studied by Slepian [Sle64]
as well as experimental evidence [SDW06] suggest [Sim10]

where B(∂U) is a function which depends on the boundary
∂U of the region U, and the spatio-spectral region of concentration is C = (L + 1)2 A(U) with area A(U). The three terms
in Eq. 6 correspond again to the three characteristic parts
of the localization spectrum. The first term is known as the
spherical Shannon number N and we will refer to the first
two terms as the generalized spherical Shannon number Ng .
A restricted setting which will be of interest in the following
is when U is a spherical cap of co-latitude Θ and only radially
symmetric Slepian functions are considered. The spectrum is
then again described by Eq. 6 but the spatio-spectral region
of concentration is in this case C = 4 (L + 1) Θ, cf. [WS05].
Sample spectra of the spatio-spectral concentration problem are shown in Fig. 2. Additional spectra and visualizations
of the basis functions are available in [LF10, SDW06].
3. The Effective Dimension of Light Transport
We will now return to our study of the effective dimension of
light transport. Consider Eq. 1 and let the transport operator
be L-bandlimited. Furthermore, assume that c(x) is the local
normal n(x); we will discuss generalizations in the sequel. By
its radial symmetry, T (n(x) · ω) is then naturally represented

An optimal K-term approximation for B(ω)
by the first K Slepian functions and these naturally satisfy
our previous orthogonality assumption. The sought estimate
for the effective dimension of T in a neighborhood U is
then provided by the Shannon number N and the generalized
Shannon number Ng .
To study the effective dimension of light transport in partially occluded environments we will assume that E(ω) =
E(h · ω) is radially symmetric with axis h ∈ S 2 and consider
the setup in Fig. 4. In the hemisphere above the origin the
lighting is then symmetric around the up axis and we assume
that the neighborhood U is sufficiently small so that deviations from this assumption are negligible for all x ∈ U. With a
derivation analogous to those which led to Eq. 7 one obtains

that the best K-term approximation for B(ω)

spatio-spectral region of concentration is C = 4 (L + 1) Θ. For
radial symmetric lighting and a region of concentration which
is a spherical cap the dimensionality hence depends directly
on the co-latitude Θ instead of the area A(U).

Experimental results are presented in Fig. 3. Note the importance of the second term of the generalized Shannon number for accurate estimates of the dimensionality. Differences
between the theoretical and empirical spectra arise from magnitude variations of the basis function coefficients for real
transport operators which we do not model.
4. Discussion

leads to the generalized Shannon number Ng . This demonstrates that there exists both a linear and a logarithmic dependence on the region of concentration. The logarithmic term
was not obtained in previous work [MSRB07] although it is
of particular importance for the settings considered in computer graphics where very low bandlimits L are employed.
For radially symmetric lighting and a neighborhood U which
is a spherical cap, a setting which allows one to study partial occlusion, we showed that the spatio-spectral region of
concentration depends linearly on the co-latitude Θ of the
spherical cap instead of the area A(U), paralleling the result
by Mahajan et al. [MSRB07]. In addition to the refined estimates for the effective dimension, the results available in
spatio-spectral concentration theory are more general than
those obtained previously; for example, they hold for arbitrarily shaped regions U ⊂ S 2 and provide insight into the
eigenfunctions associated with the problem. Our results also
do not rely on a discretization of the transport operator. Unfortunately, the eigenvalue distribution for the spatio-spectral
concentration problem on the sphere in Eq. 6 remains a conjecture and the true boundary function B(∂U) is unknown.
However, our experimental results demonstrate the usefulness
of our novel boundary term and we believe it will have applications in other areas where Slepian functions are employed.
We studied the effective dimension of light transport by
approximating the local neighborhood U ⊂ M on the scene
manifold by a subset U ⊂ S 2 of the sphere. Other choices
for U are conceivable and a subset U ⊂ R2 of the plane is
sensible in particular for regions U ⊂ M where curvature
is negligible. In the plane the spectrum of the spatio-spectral
concentration problem consists again of the three characteristic parts [Sle64]. Furthermore, Simons et al. [SDW06]
showed that asymptotically for A(U) → 0 the spatio-spectral
concentration problem on the sphere reduces to that in the
plane. The consistency of these results is important since any
estimate for the effective dimension should be independent
of the details of the approximations.

We showed that the effective dimension of a bandlimited and
radially symmetric transport operator in a local neighborhood
on the scene manifold can be studied using spatio-spectral
concentration theory. An estimate for the dimensionality is
given by the Shannon number N and a more refined analysis

In Sec. 3 we derived our result with the axis of radial symmetry being the local normal n(x). Our derivation is more
generally applicable as long as c(x) can be identified uniquely
with a point on the sphere. For example for the Phong operator considered by Mahajan et al. [MSRB07], with the
reflection direction as the axis of symmetry, the required
identification is (θ, φ) = (2 θ, φ). Most physically motivated
bidirectional reflection distribution functions are not strictly
radially symmetric as we assumed in our derivation. The
phenomenological success of the Phong model suggests however that radial symmetry is a useful first order assumption,
and for the Torrance-Sparrow model it is known that radial
symmetry holds for small outgoing angles [RH04]. Further
investigations would be a valuable addition to the literature.

lem, is more amenable to extensions. For example, Spherical
Harmonics are well-suited for the representation of smooth
signals. The signals encountered in rendering are however
only piece-wise smooth and hence wavelet-like constructions
provide optimal representations [Mal09]. An analysis of the
present problem using such bases and nonlinear approximation strategies is an exciting area for future work.

Mahajan et al. [MSRB07] employed their results for instance to guide transport matrix compression for precomputed radiance transfer and to develop object representations
suited for efficient rendering. These are also possible applications for our work and our improved estimates might
afford increased efficiency. In contrast to previous work, our
derivation yields expressions for the basis functions and a
representation using Slepian functions can be used to exploit the coherence of light transport without a costly principal component analysis. The experimental results in Fig. 3
moreover demonstrate that substantial efficiency gains can
be expected with this ansatz. The required mapping from the
neighborhood U ⊂ M on the scene manifold to a region
2
U ⊂ SM
on the sphere can be accomplished using normal
directions or the isometric embedding provided by the exponential map. A comparison to clustered principal component
analysis, which was employed in previous work, is an interesting area for future work. We believe Slepian functions
will also prove useful for the effective representation of localized signals such as functions defined over the hemisphere
where alternatives to Spherical Harmonics have already been
explored [Mak96, GKPB04, RKB05] but these often do not
provide orthogonality over U and S 2 and closure under rotation. For example, in precomputed radiance transfer Slepian
functions would make it possible to increase the bandlimit of
the signals without degrading visual quality or performance.
Rotation of Slepian functions would be possible with a variation of a rotation algorithm recently developed by us for
Spherical Harmonics [LdWF10]. For sampling based techniques the coherence of light transport has not been exploited
systematically in the past. We believe that the understanding
gained in this note will be useful to improve the efficacy of
these techniques by facilitating the development of rigorous
algorithms which exploit coherence between samples.
