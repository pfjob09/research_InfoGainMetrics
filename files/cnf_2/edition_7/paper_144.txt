Abstract
We present an algorithm for the reconstruction of a surface with boundaries (including a non-orientable one)
in three dimensions from a sufficiently dense sample. It is guaranteed that the output is isotopic to the unknown
sampled surface. No previously known algorithm guarantees isotopic or homeomorphic reconstruction of surfaces with boundaries. Our algorithm is surprisingly simple. It ‘peels’ slivers greedily from an α-complex of a
sample of the surface. No other post-processing is necessary. We provide several experimental results from an
implementation of our basic algorithm and also a modified version of it.
Categories and Subject Descriptors (according to ACM CCS): I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Surface Reconstruction—

1. Introduction
This paper is concerned with the design of a provably correct algorithm that can reconstruct surfaces with boundaries in three dimensions. In the last decade a number of
algorithms for the problem of surface reconstruction have
been proposed [AB99,ACDL02,ACSTD07,BC00,FCOS05,
HDD∗ 92, JWS08, KBH06, OBA∗ 03, PKKG03, WOK05].
Among them, the ones that come with theoretical guarantees [AB99, ACDL02, BC00, Dey07] assume that the sampled surface is smooth and closed (compact and no boundary). The proofs and the algorithms fail if boundaries are
allowed.
For a provably correct reconstruction algorithm, typically
one looks for guarantees on the geometric and topological
similarities between the output and the sampled surface. Geometric guarantees generally mean small Hausdorff distance
between the sampled surface Σ ⊂ R3 and the output. Topological guarantee, however, may be of homotopy equivalence, homeomorphism, or isotopy–listed in the increasing
order of topological similarity. It is desirable that the output
be isotopic to Σ. Isotopy means that there is a smooth deformation of R3 that brings the output to Σ while maintaining a
homeomorphism between the two all the time.
The case of closed smooth surfaces is now well understood. There exist established algorithms and software that
can reconstruct such surfaces with isotopy guarantee from
point data [AB99, ACDL02] even if they are contaminated

with noise [Dey07]. However, the important case of surfaces with boundaries is less understood. The theory of compact reconstruction put forward by Chazal, Cohen-Steiner,
and Lieutier [CCSL06] applies to such surfaces. However,
this result only guarantees a homotopy equivalence between
the sampled surface and the output. In fact, the algorithm
which constructs α-complexes may return a single point for
a disk. In this paper we show that a very simple algorithm
can reconstruct all smooth surfaces Σ ⊂ R3 , with or without boundary, while guaranteeing an isotopy and a small
Hausdorff distance between the output and Σ. The algorithm
computes an α-complex and then ‘peels’ tetrahedra from it
greedily. No other post-processing is necessary. We argue
mainly about the isotopy since Hausdorff distance claim follows from dense sampling.
For closed surface reconstructions, a fundamental property used for proofs is that a closed surface is homeomorphic
(and isotopic) to the restricted Delaunay triangulation of a
sufficiently dense point sample. (See Section 2.1 for a definition of the restricted Delaunay triangulation.) As shown in
Section 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 3, this is not true for a
surface Σ with boundary. To overcome this problem we use
a collar extension of Σ. We show that a restricted Delaunay
triangulation of a sufficiently dense point sample of Σ is isotopic to this collar extension. We emphasize that the collar is
only needed for the proof of correctness, it does not need to
be sampled or used in any way by the algorithm.

cone [AB99, ACDL02] identify candidate triangles for the
reconstructed surface and then use a prune-and-walk approach to extract a manifold. Such an approach fails when
boundaries are present, since the pruning repeatedly removes
boundary triangles until no triangles are left. We present a
‘sliver peeling’ approach based on the following idea. We
prove the existence of a canonical peeling sequence of tetrahedra from an α-complex induced by a deformation retraction of the associated union of α-balls. For a closed surface
Σ, this sequence peels the α-complex to the restricted Delaunay triangulation which is known to be isotopic to Σ. Even
though one cannot compute the canonical peeling sequence
in absence of Σ, we show that a greedy peeling produces an
output isotopic to that produced by the canonical peeling sequence. For surfaces with boundaries, the argument remains
essentially the same except that now one has to argue with
the restricted Delaunay triangulation of a collar extension.
Another problem that arises in reconstructing surfaces
with boundaries is the existence of non-unique solutions.
For instance, it can be impossible to distinguish between the
point sample of a sphere with a small disk removed and a
sphere which happens to not have any sample points in a
small disk. We use an input parameter α which allows us
to distinguish between boundary regions and small regions
which have no sample points.
One noteworthy feature of our algorithm is that it can reconstruct non-orientable surfaces (necessarily open ones as
they are embedded in R3 ). Since there is no global orientation of normals for such surfaces, it is difficult to extract
such a surface from a complex by any consistent walk. The
technique of sliver ‘peeling’ resolves this problem.
Our algorithm works nicely for dense uniform samples in
practice as the theory predicts. However, it faces problems
when the sample is not uniform. We extend our basic ‘peeling’ algorithm to handle non-uniform samples and show experimental results for this modification. Our algorithm is not
geared to handle noise in data.

2. Preliminaries
We set up some basic notations and concepts that are needed
to describe the reconstruction algorithm.

2.1. Complexes, feature size, and sampling
Voronoi and Delaunay Complexes: For a point set P ⊂ R3 ,
we use Vor P and Del P to denote the Voronoi and Delaunay
complexes of P. The Voronoi cell of p is Vp . The Voronoi
face dual to a Delaunay simplex σ ∈ Del P is denoted Vσ . The
restricted Delaunay complex of P with respect to a topological space X ⊆ R3 is Del X (P) = {σ ∈ Del P : Vσ ∩ X = ∅}.
Alpha-Complex: For α > 0, the α-ball of p, denoted
B(p, α), is the closed ball centered at p and of radius α. The

union of α-balls for a set P is
Bα (P) =

[

B(p, α).

p∈P

The α-complex Cα (P) of P is the restricted Delaunay complex of P with respect to Bα (P). That is,
Cα (P) = {σ ∈ Del P : Vσ ∩ Bα (P) = ∅}.
It is well-known that Bα (P) and Cα (P) have the same
homotopy type [Ede95]. If P is a sufficiently dense sample from a shape Σ, it is known that Bα (P) and Cα (P)
have topological similarity to Σ for appropriate α [CCSL06,
CSEH05, NSW08]. In particular, Bα (P) and Cα (P) become
homotopy equivalent to Σ when the sample is sufficiently
dense [CCSL06, NSW08], a fact we need for our results.
Local feature size: We consider a smooth surface Σ with
smooth boundaries ∂Σ. The surface normal nx to Σ at x
is then well-defined in the surface interior and also on the
boundary by taking the limit. At a boundary point y ∈ ∂Σ,
there is also an open half-circle of normal directions with the
two orientations of the surface normal ny as the limit points.
The local feature size function is a measure of the local
level of detail. For a closed surface, it is defined as the distance, d(x, M), to the medial axis M of the surface [AB99].
For a smooth surface with smooth boundaries, this is still
well-defined but does not capture the required minimum
sampling (to see this, consider for example a flat disk). We
consider M , the medial axis of the boundary ∂Σ separately
and define:
lfs(x) = min{d(x, M), d(x, M ) + d(x, ∂Σ) /2}.
Note that the M can intersect the surface Σ and so d(x, M )
may be zero. However, if d(x, M ) is zero, then x is “far”
from ∂Σ and so lfs(x) is still non-zero.
With the above definition of lfs, Proposition 1 extends
three essential properties of closed surfaces to surfaces with
boundaries. For a triangle t we use nt to denote its normal.
Unless specified otherwise we measure angles between vectors by the acute angle made by their supporting lines. The
notation O(ε) means a value that is less than cε for some
constant c > 0 when ε is sufficiently small.
Proposition 1 Let ε ≤ 1 and x, y, z ∈ Σ. If x − y =
O(ε)lfs(x) and the circumradius of t = xyz is at most
O(ε)lfs(x), then:
(i) (Normal variation is small) ∠nx ny = O(ε),
(ii) (Short edges are close to tangent) ∠nx xy ≥ π/2 − O(ε),
(iii)(Small triangles are almost parallel to the surface)
∠nt nx = O(ε).
Essentially the same proof [AB99, ACDL02] applies here
as for the same properties for closed surfaces once (i) is
established. The proof of (i) can be carried out along the
lines presented in [CDR05]. Although the definition of lfs
in [CDR05] differs from the one used here, for a point x ∈ Σ,

lfs(x) remains smaller than the medial balls touching Σ at x
which is essential for the proof to go through. See appendix
for the proof.

Sampling condition: The standard sampling condition requires that for any x ∈ Σ, B(x, εlfs(x)) contains a sample [AB99]. In the presence of boundaries, this is not sufficient for correct reconstruction. There is no unique tightening of the condition. We use a global measure ρ =
infx∈Σ lfs(x) and define P to be an ε-sample of Σ if B(x, ερ)
contains a point in P for any x ∈ Σ. We do not require the
boundaries to be sampled by points lying on them. Requiring
such a sampling of the boundaries would make the problem
easier but less realistic.

2.2. Peeling tetrahedra
Our idea is to compute a subcomplex K of an alpha complex
Cα (P) for sufficiently small α and then peel tetrahedra from
it to arrive at a triangulated surface. The existence and computation of the peeling order are justified by a deformation
retraction of the ball union Bα (P). Before describing this
retraction, we elaborate on tetrahedra peeling and observe
some of its key properties.
Let σ ∈ K be a tetrahedron with an edge e and t1 ,t2 be
two triangles of σ incident to e. We say σ is peelable by e
if no triangles other than t1 and t2 are incident to e in K.
A new complex K is obtained by removing the collection
of simplices {σ,t1 ,t2 , e} from K. In that case we say K is
e
obtained by peeling e from K and write K → K . A peeling
takes out two triangles of a tetrahedron while leaving the
other two. If K is obtained from K by peeling a sequence
e1 ,e2 ,...,ek
edges e1 , e2 , ..., ek , we write K → K . A peeling does
not delete any vertex and therefore the vertex set of K and
K remains the same.
We need one more definition before stating our generic
results on peeling. Two edge sequences {ei } and {gi } by
which a complex K is peeled are called compatible if for all
pair of edges e ∈ {ei } and g ∈ {gi } where e and g peel the
same tetrahedron in K, either e = g or e and g are vertex disjoint. Essentially two compatible peeling sequences peel a
tetrahedron either at the same edge or at two vertex disjoint
edges if both of them peel it. Two such sequences may differ in length. Figure 1 illustrates how compatibility ensures
isotopy. The peeling of vertex disjoint edges e1 and e3 in
sequences {e2 , e1 } and {e3 , e2 } leads to isotopy.
Our main observation is Proposition 2 below which says
that if a simplicial 3-complex is peeled by two compatible
sequences both of which remove all tetrahedra, the resulting
2-complexes are necessarily isotopic. Notice that we do not
require any extra condition on the input 3-complex for this
proposition. Its proof by induction uses Proposition 3 whose
proof appears in the appendix.

Figure 1: The sequences {e2 , e1 } and {e3 , e2 } are compatible, but {e4 , e1 } is not compatible with either of them.

Proposition 2 Suppose K0 is a simplicial 3-complex with
g1 ,g2 ,...,gk
e1 ,e2 ,...,ek
k ≥ 0 tetrahedra. If K0
→ K1 and K0
→
K2
for two compatible sequences of edges {e1 , e2 , ..., ek } and
{g1 , g2 , ..., gk }, then K1 and K2 are isotopic.
Proof We prove by induction on k. For k = 1, K0 has a single tetrahedron which is peelable by e1 and g1 . If e1 = g1 ,
K1 = K2 . If e1 = g1 , they are opposite edges of the single
tetrahedron in K0 . Clearly, peeling by e1 and g1 gives two
isotopic complexes. We now assume that for any k < k the
g1
proposition is true and verify it for k. Let K0 → K . Since
{g1 } and {e1 , e2 , ..., ek } are compatible, by Proposition 3 below there is a sequence {e1 , e2 , ..., ek−1 } of edges compatie1 ,e2 ,...,ek−1

→
K3 where K3 is
ble with {e1 , ..., ek } so that K
g2 ,g3 ,...,gk
isotopic to K1 . By assumption K
→ K2 , and also the
sequences {g2 , g3 , ..., gk } and {e1 , e2 , ..., ek−1 } are compatible since both of them are compatible with {e1 , e2 , ..., ek }.
Then, by inductive hypothesis K2 and K3 are isotopic which
implies that K2 and K1 are isotopic.
Proposition 3 Suppose K0 is a simplicial 3-complex with
e1 ,...,ek
K0 → K1 for edges e1 , ..., ek . Let e be an edge compatible
e
with e1 , ..., ek so that K0 → K and e peels a tetrahedron that
is peeled by some edge in the sequence e1 , ..., ek . Then, there
is a sequence e1 , ..., ek−1 compatible with e1 , .., ek so that
K

e1 ...,ek−1

→

K2 and K1 is isotopic to K2 .

3. Closed surface
For simplicity first we assume that the sampled surface has
no boundary and then describe the modifications needed to
accommodate boundaries. Proposition 2 motivates the following approach:
a. Consider an α-complex K spanning the input point set P.

b. Prove that there is a canonical edge sequence which peel
all tetrahedra from K and the resulting complex is the
restricted Delaunay triangulation Del Σ (P).
c. Unfortunately, this canonical sequence is impossible to
compute in absence of Σ. So, algorithmically find another
peeling sequence which peels all tetrahedra from K.
d. Prove that the peeling sequence adopted by the algorithm
is compatible with the canonical sequence. Appeal to
Proposition 2 to claim that the resulting complex is isotopic to Del Σ (P).

3.1. Canonical edge sequence
To show the existence of a canonical edge sequence, we define a deformation retraction ret(x,t) on R3 which retracts
Bα (P) to the surface Σ. For any non medial axis point x ∈ R3 ,
let x˜ be its closest point on Σ. Define
ret(x,t) = x˜ + (1 − t) · (x − x)
˜ for t ∈ [0, 1].
If α is sufficiently small, this deformation retraction is a witness to the homotopy equivalence between Bα and Σ. This
deformation retraction is reminiscent of the flow function
used in [Ede03, GJ02]. However, a key difference is that
we consider distances to the surface Σ instead of distances to
the sample P.
We are interested in the interpretation of the retraction
ret(x,t) in the context of sub-complexes of Del P. We define
Bα,t (P) = {ret(x,t) : x ∈ Bα (P)} and Cα,t (P) = Del Bα,t (P) (P).
Observe that Bα (P) = Bα,0 (P) retracts to Σ = Bα,1 (P).
In the dual α-complex Cα (P) = Cα,0 (P) retracts to the
restricted Delaunay triangulation Del Σ (P) = Cα,1 (P). Let
σ1 , ..., σn denote the sequence of simplices removed from
Cα,t (P) as Cα (P) = Cα,0 (P) transforms to Del Σ (P) =
Cα,1 (P). We call σ1 , ..., σn the canonical simplex sequence
for Cα (P). We argue that the subsequence of edges in this
simplex sequence indeed peels all simplices in the sequence
and thus form a canonical edge sequence we are looking for.
Let us look at how ∂Bα,t (P) sweeps over the Voronoi diagram. When ∂Bα,t (P) sweeps over a Voronoi vertex, edge,
or a facet completely, their dual simplices get removed from
the restricted triangulation Cα,t (P). If all Voronoi edges and
facets intersecting Bα,t (P) intersect its boundary ∂Bα,t (P)
transversally, they go out of Bα,t (P) only when a Voronoi
vertex is swept over. This means Cα,t (P) only changes when
a tetrahedron is removed. Now let us look at how ∂Bα,t (P)
sweeps over a Voronoi vertex v. In Figure 2, the vertex v is
about to be swept when the dual tetrahedron σ is peeled. It is
proved in Proposition 6 that σ is a sliver tetrahedron (see section 3.3 for definition) if α is small. In particular, this means
two of the Voronoi edges incident to v make large angle close
to π with vv˜ and the other two make small angle close to 0
with it. As a result when v is swept over, exactly two of the
Voronoi edges, say e1 and e2 , incident to v leave Bα,t (P).
Interpreting dually, the tetrahedron σ is peeled from Cα,t (P)

at the edge, say e, dual to the Voronoi facet containing e1
and e2 . The subsequence of edges like e from the canonical
simplex sequence form the desired canonical edge sequence.
The above argument dwells on two facts: (i) Voronoi
facets and edges intersect ∂Bα,t (P) transversally, and (ii) all
tetrahedra in Cα (P) are slivers. We show these two facts.
3.2. Transversal intersections
To talk about transversal intersections between Voronoi
edges, facets and ∂Bα,t (P), we need to define a notion of
normals to ∂Bα,t (P) since it is not necessarily a smooth surface. Consider ∂Bα (P) = ∂Bα,0 (P). This is the boundary
of a spherical polyhedron. The boundaries of the facets in
this spherical polyhedron constitute non-smooth regions in
∂Bα (P). A point x(t) ∈ ∂Bα,t (P) is given by x(t) = x˜ + (1 −
t)(x − x)
˜ where x ∈ ∂Bα (P). It follows that x(t) is a smooth
point in ∂Bα,t (P) if x is smooth in ∂Bα (P). For a non-smooth
point x(t) ∈ ∂Bα,t (P), consider the set of normals Nx(t) that
are limit points of the normals to the smooth points in any
neighborhood of x(t). The normal cone at x(t) is given by
the convex hull Conv Nx(t) .
We first establish a bound on the angles between normals
to ∂Bα (P) at smooth points and the normals of Σ and then
extend the bound for all points in ∂Bα,t (P), t ∈ [0, 1]. Proposition 4 is proved in the appendix. Recall that P is assumed
to be an ε-sample of Σ.
Proposition 4 Let α = κερ and κε ≤ 1/2. Let x be any point
in ∂Bα,t (P). The normal of ∂Bα,t (P) at x and the normal to
Σ at x˜ form an angle of at most 4 sin−1 (2/κ).
Let us now consider a point x on a Voronoi facet or edge
that ∂Bα,t (P) is about to sweep. Let 6ερ ≤ α ≤ 6ερ + O(ερ).
For this choice of α, we have κ = 6 in Proposition 4 which
assures that a normal to a point x on ∂Bα,t (P) makes an
angle of at most 4 sin−1 (1/3) ≈ 80◦ with the surface normal at x.
˜ By Proposition 1, the Voronoi edges and facets
intersecting Bα,t (P) make an angle of O(ε) with the surface normals. A standard calculation reveals that they intersect ∂Bα,t (P) with an angle of at most 4 sin−1 (1/3) + O(ε)
which is smaller than π2 if ε is sufficiently small. Therefore, Voronoi edges and facets cannot intersect ∂Bα,t (P) tangentially implying that all peelings are associated with a

Voronoi vertex going out of Bα,t (P). Thus, a canonical simplex sequence σ1 , ..., σn induces a canonical edge sequence
at which tetrahedra are peeled which effectively removes all
of {σ1 , ..., σn }. We have:
Proposition 5 For 6ρε ≤ α ≤ 6ερ + O(ερ), let K = Cα (P).
There is a canonical edge sequence {e1 , e2 ..., ek } where
e1 ,e2 ,...,ek
K → Del Σ (P).
3.3. Slivers and top-down peeling
Now we show that all tetrahedra in Cα (P) are 2-2-flat. We
also refer to them as slivers although strictly speaking they
may not be slivers by standard definition in meshing. A tetrahedron σ is called ε-flat if all normals to its triangles differ
by O(ε) angle. For a sufficiently small ε, an ε-flat tetrahedron
can only be in two configurations with respect to the internal
dihedral angles at its edges. These internal dihedral angles
are either π − O(ε) or O(ε). If two angles are π − O(ε) and
other four are O(ε), we say it is a 2-2-flat tetrahedron (corresponds to slivers.) Otherwise, when three angles are π−O(ε)
and the other three are O(ε), we say it a 1-3-flat tetrahedron.
No other configuration is possible for an ε-flat tetrahedron.
Proposition 6 Let α = O(ε)ρ. For t ∈ [0, 1] let σ ∈ Cα,t (P).
(i) If σ is a triangle, ∠nσ n p = O(ε) where p is any vertex of
σ. (ii) If σ is a tetrahedron, it is 2-2-flat.
Proof (i) Since the dual Voronoi edge is intersected by
Bα,t (P), the circumradius of σ is at most α = O(ε)ρ. The
claim follows from Proposition 1(iii). (ii) First observe that
σ is an ε-flat tetrahedron due to (i). If σ were 1-3-flat, there is
a vertex p of σ which subtends a solid angle close to 2π. The
line of the normal n p intersects the opposite triangle τ of σ,
for otherwise n p has to be almost parallel to τ contradicting
Proposition 1(iii). We now apply the argument of Lemma 11
of [ACDL02] to claim that this is impossible.
Let us now go back to the scenario when a Voronoi vertex
v is about to be swept over. The edge e at which the dual
tetrahedron of v is peeled, subtends a large dihedral angle
π − O(ε). We use this observation to ensure a compatible
edge sequence in the algorithm. The following definition
helps. We say a 2-2-flat tetrahedron is peeled top-down if
it is peeled at an edge subtending a large dihedral angle of
π − O(ε). We also say an edge sequence e1 , e2 , ..., ek is topdown if all tetrahedra are peeled top-down by the sequence.
Since any top-down edge sequence peels a 2-2-flat tetrahedron only at edges that subtend large dihedral angles, two
such sequences must be compatible.
Proposition 7 For a complex containing only 2-2-flat tetrahedra, any two top-down peeling sequences are compatible.

3.4. Algorithm
We already indicated that we cannot determine the canonical
sequence because Σ is not known. But, thanks to Proposition 2, if we find any edge sequence for K that is compatible

with the canonical one, we obtain a 2-complex isotopic to
Del Σ (P). Our algorithm below finds such a sequence.
P EEL(P, α)
1. Compute the α-complex K := Cα (P);
2. While there is a peelable tetrahedron in K, peel it
top-down;
3. Output the resulting 2-complex.
Theorem 1 For 6ερ ≤ α ≤ 6ερ + O(ερ) the algorithm P EEL
computes a subcomplex of Cα (P) that is a manifold triangulation isotopic to Σ, and is within a small Hausdorff distance.
Proof First, we argue that the algorithm peels all tetrahedra
from Cα (P). By Proposition 5 there is a canonical edge see1 ,e2 ,...,ek
quence e1 , e2 , ..., ek so that Cα (P) → Del Σ (P).
Suppose that the algorithm gets “stuck” with tetrahedra
σ1 , . . . , σs none of which is peelable, and let σi be the tetrahedron among these that first appears in the canonical sequence of peeling. Since σi is first, the canonical sequence
finds σi peelable at a moment when all of the other σ j , j = i,
are still present. This is a contradiction and our algorithm
should also find σi peelable.
Let e1 , e2 , ..., ek be the edge sequence by which the algorithm

k
T where T is the output
peels Cα (P), that is, Cα (P) 1 →
complex. In the canonical sequence e1 , e2 , ..., ek , each peel
is top-down. Each peel conducted by the algorithm is also
top-down. Therefore, the sequences {ei } and {ei } are compatible (Proposition 7). By Proposition 2, T is isotopic to
Del Σ (P). The claim about Hausdorff distance follows from
standard calculations as T consists of triangles with small
circumradii, see [AB99, Dey07].

4. Surface with boundaries
We show that the algorithm P EEL computes a surface isotopic to Σ even if Σ has a non-empty boundary. A first difficulty to overcome is that a surface with boundaries do not
necessarily admit a restricted Delaunay triangulation which
is homeomorphic to the surface no matter how dense the
sample is. We use a collar extension to counter this difficulty.
4.1. Collar extension
Recall that we do not require the boundary curves of the surface themselves be well-sampled. Under this condition, for a
good sample, Del Σ (P) may not be an isotopic or homeomorphic reconstruction of Σ (though it is homotopy equivalent to
it). See the picture on left in Figure 3. The restricted Delaunay triangulation there is not a proper manifold (there is a
pinching at the boundary). This can be repaired though by
considering the Delaunay triangulation restricted to the surface with added collar. Let x be any point in the boundary
∂Σ. Consider the tangent fiber γx at x that is perpendicular to
µ
∂Σ at x. A segment of this fiber of length µ is denoted γx . Let

Figure 3: Left: The restricted Delaunay triangulation in the
‘almost’ planar configuration has a non-manifold feature in
its boundary. Right: The collar is obtained by extending from
every boundary point x a “fiber” in the tangent plane at x.

xx˜ makes small angle with a normal to ∂Bα,t (P). But, unlike
the closed surface case, xx˜ may not be almost parallel to f
because if x˜ is on ∂Σ, the angle ∠xx,
˜ nx˜ could be large (recall
the definition of surface normals at boundary points). We
cannot claim that a Voronoi face in Bα,t (P) is never tangent
to ∂Bα,t (P).
As a remedy we consider extending Σ by a small amount
so that all points in Bα (P) project in the interior of the extended Σ. This requires a slightly larger balls in the union
to contain the extended surface inside. This larger union
sweeps over all Voronoi faces it intersects, but we only focus
on the subset of the Voronoi faces which intersect Bα (P).
Proposition 10 Any point in Bα (P) projects to an interior
point in Σ3α .

µ

Σµ = Σ ∪ {γx }x∈∂Σ . See the picture on right in Figure 3. It is
a standard result in differential topology that every smooth
surface can be extended with a collar while maintaining an
isotopy if the extension length µ is sufficiently small.
We need to investigate how much the normal changes
within the collar compared to the normal at the original
boundary. Note that the normal can indeed change along an
extension fiber. The following proposition is proved in the
appendix.
µ

Proposition 8 Let x be a boundary point and γx its extenµ
sion fiber. For x ∈ γx ⊂ Σµ with x − x ≤ µ we have
tan ∠nx nx = O(µ/ρ).
Finally, we want to show that the Delaunay triangulation restricted to Σµ is a good canonical reconstruction when
µ = O(ρε) is chosen appropriately. For a sufficiently small
µ, the bound on the normal in the collar implies that Voronoi
edges and facets intersect Σµ almost orthogonally in the collar (which is already known for Σ). We also need a similar
fact for the boundary ∂Σµ .
Proposition 9 Let µ = κερ. Let F be a Voronoi facet that
intersects ∂Σµ at x. If τx is the tangent to ∂Σµ at x and nF is
κ
where
the normal to F, then ∠τx , nF ≤ O(κε) + cos−1 1+κ
ε is sufficiently small.
Standard arguments [Dey07] using the near orthogonality
between the surface and Voronoi faces provide the following
result (see appendix for a proof).
Theorem 2 For 2ερ ≤ µ ≤ 2ερ + O(ερ), Del Σµ P is a manifold triangulation isotopic to Σµ when ε is sufficiently small.

4.2. Boundary and peeling
We follow P EEL to remove tetrahedra from Cα (P). Assume
that 6ερ ≤ α ≤ 6ερ + O(ερ) as before. One problem we now
face is that not all points in Bα (P) project in the interior of Σ
by the closest point map. Observe that the proof of Proposition 4 still remains valid for surfaces with boundaries. Therefore, at a point x ∈ Bα,t (P) on a Voronoi face f , the segment

Proof Let x be any point in Bα (P). If x projects normally to
the interior of Σ, it does so for any Σµ if µ is small. Consider
x projecting to a point x˜ in ∂Σ. The closest point of x on the
˜
surface Σµ , µ > 2α, cannot be further away than 2α from x.
It follows that x projects to the interior of Σµ for µ ≥ 3α.
Consider B4α (P). Observe that any point in Σ3α is within
a distance of ερ+3α ≤ 4α from a sample point. It means that
B4α (P) contains Σ3α . We consider the retraction of B4α (P)
to Σ3α . This retraction defines a canonical sequence of simplex deletions reducing C4α (P) to Del Σ3α (P). We are interested in the restriction of this sequence to the simplices of
Cα (P). Because of Proposition 10, we can argue similarly
as in the closed surface case that a Voronoi face in Bα (P) is
never tangent to ∂B4α,t (P) if 6ερ ≤ α ≤ 6ερ+O(ερ). Therefore the canonical sequence of deleted simplices in C4α (P)
indeed induces an edge sequence at which all tetrahedra in
Cα (P) are peeled top-down. This is the canonical sequence
of peeling we consider for Cα (P).
There is one more difference from the closed surface case
that we need to address. In the closed surface case Cα (P)
retracts to Del Σ (P). Here, since we are considering the retraction of B4α (P), we cannot claim that the induced peeling
of Cα (P) will provide Del Σ (P).
Let K∗ be the complex produced by the canonical peeling of Cα (P) induced by the canonical sequence of simplex
deletions in C4α (P). First notice that since C4α (P) retracts
to Del Σ3α and K∗ is obtained by restricting this retraction to
Cα (P), we have K∗ ⊆ Del Σ3α (P). Also, since Del Σ2ερ (P) ⊆
Del Σ3α (P) and Cα (P) contains Del Σ2ερ (P) for α > 3ερ,
we have Del Σ2ερ (P) ⊆ K∗ . In essence, Del Σ2ερ (P) ⊆ K∗ ⊆
Del Σ3α , that is, K∗ is sandwiched between two triangulations
both of which are isotopic to Σ. This leads to the main result
of this paper.
Theorem 3 Let P be an ε-sample of a smooth compact surface with boundary. For sufficiently small ε > 0 and 6ερ <
α ≤ 6ερ + O(ερ), P EEL(P, α) produces a 2-complex T isotopic to Σ.
Proof The algorithm P EEL computes Cα (P) in step 2. Consider the complex K∗ produced by the canonical peeling in

Cα (P) induced by the canonical peeling of C4α (P). First we
argue that if K∗ is isotopic to Σ, our algorithm produces a
complex that is isotopic to Σ as well.
Let e1 , e2 , ..., ek be the canonical sequence of edges where
e1 ,e2 ,...,ek
Cα (P) → K∗ . Since all Voronoi vertices dual to the
tetrahedra in Cα (P) project normally to the interior of Σ3α ,
the canonical peeling is top-down. We can apply the same
argument as in Theorem 1 to claim that the algorithm finds
a peeling sequence which reduces Cα (P) to a 2-complex T
where K∗ and T are isotopic. Hence T is isotopic to Σ if K∗
is isotopic to Σ.
We argue that K∗ is indeed isotopic to Σ. For convenience
we write R1 = Del Σ2ερ (P) and R2 = Del Σ3α . We have R1 ⊆
K∗ ⊆ R2 . By theorem 2, R1 and R2 are isotopic to Σ and thus
are isotopic to each other. Also, K∗ is homotopy equivalent
to Cα (P) since each peel maintains a homotopy equivalence
between the complexes before and after the peel and Cα (P)
is homotopy equivalent to Σ to begin with [CCSL06].
First we observe a property of the complex that represents
the difference between R1 and R2 . Formally, let W = cl(R2 −
R1 ). The space |W | cannot contain any handle or Möbius
band since then R1 will have different topology than R2 .
Next we prove that K∗ is a manifold.
We introduce the following definition for convenience. For a
vertex v in a complex K, let Tv denote its star. If the underlying space |Tv | is a topological disk, and v is in the interior of
|Tv |, we say v is complete in K. If |Tv | is a topological disk
but v lies on the boundary, we say v has a half-disk neighborhood in K. Observe that each complete vertex of R1 remains
complete in K∗ and R2 . Also, the vertex set of R1 , R2 and
K∗ is same. These two facts imply that each boundary in K∗

and R2 is generated from the boundaries of R1 by possibly
attaching triangles among boundary vertices. Since connecting vertices across different boundaries would require triangles with edges larger than 4α, boundaries of K∗ and R2 are
generated by attaching triangles that connect boundary vertices in the same boundary of R1 .
Now consider an incomplete vertex v of K∗ . Since v is a
boundary vertex in R1 , we can assume that v is in a boundary b in R1 . If v does not have a half-disk neighborhood in
K∗ , it is incident to at least two boundaries in K∗ which is
generated from b. But then K∗ would contain more boundaries than R1 or R2 since each boundary of R2 also provides
at least one boundary in K∗ . This is because an incomplete
vertex in R2 also remains incomplete in K∗ . Since the difference cl(K∗ − R1 ) ⊆ W has no handles and Möbius bands,
K∗ has same number of handles and Möbius bands as in R1 .
Then, K∗ cannot have different number of boundaries from
R1 since K∗ and R1 are homotopy equivalent. It follows that
K∗ is a manifold since it has vertices which are either complete or have a half-disk neighborhood.
Now we examine the space of cl(K∗ − R1 ) more closely. A
boundary, say b in K∗ is generated from a boundary b in R1
by possibly attaching triangles between vertices of b. Furthermore, a single boundary b in R1 generates exactly one
boundary in K∗ . The space bounded by b and b in K∗ does
not have any handle, boundary, or Möbius strip. This means
b and b bounds a cylinder which is possibly pinched at common vertices of b and b . There is a natural deformation
retraction of K∗ to R1 defined by the obvious deformation
retraction of bi s to bi s along these cylinders. This deforma-

tion retraction is a witness to an isotopy between K∗ and R1 .
Since R1 is isotopic to Σ, we have the claimed result.
5. Extensions and experiments
We implemented P EEL and some results are shown in Figure 4. When the sample is uniformly dense, P EEL produces
correct results as these examples show. The output is a 2manifold without any artifact. We can even reconstruct nonorientable surfaces such as the Möbius band example in Figure 4. We chose the α to be a factor (six times) of the largest
nearest neighbor distance among the given points. Since all
these examples have almost uniform sampling, this choice
worked nicely confirming our theory.
In practice, however, the data are often non-uniform. We
made adjustments to our algorithm to handle non-uniform
data. We emphasize that if the data is a non-uniform sample
of a surface with a boundary, there is a theoretical hurdle to
reconstruct it provably. It stems from the fact that the same
sample can be dense for two topologically different surfaces
if boundaries are allowed. Therefore, there is no unique correct reconstruction. We employ a heuristic to handle nonuniform samples of surfaces with boundaries.
If the input is non-uniform, there may be no global α for
which an α-complex may contain an isotopic triangulation to
the sampled surface. Since nearest neighbor distances may
vary widely if non-uniform density is allowed, an α fitting
local density cannot be estimated from them. Instead we propose to estimate the local density at each input point and then
take a ball around the point whose size respects the estimated
density. As before, we consider the union of balls U and peel
tetrahedra from the restricted Delaunay complex Del U (P).
Notice that if the balls are not too large or too small with
respect to local feature sizes, the Voronoi elements intersecting U will do so transversally and therefore a deformation
retraction of U would induce a canonical edge sequence in
the restricted complex.
First, we determine the set R of all sample points near
the boundary by the modified Cocone algorithm [DG01]
(We use the software C OCONE). A parameter in C OCONE
regulates which points are detected as boundary. Then, for
each point p we compute a width w p as follows. For each
non-boundary point p ∈ P − R, the width w p is the cocone
width [DG01]. Roughly speaking, the cocone width estimates the largest distance of p to its local Voronoi neighbors
on the surface (cocone neighbors) and thus tracks the local
sparsity/density of the sample. For a boundary point p ∈ R,
we take the largest width of its non-boundary cocone neighbors as w p . Then,
U=

[

B(p, w p ).

p∈P

In our implementation, for efficiency, we do not consider
all simplices in Del U (P). Instead a subcomplex consisting

of simplices whose dual Voronoi elements intersect the cocones [ACDL02, DG01] is considered. The rationale is that
this subcomplex contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation of the surface and at the same time inherits a canonical edge sequence from the retraction of Del U (P). Figure 5
shows the results of this extension.
6. Concluding remarks
Our results on sliver peeling may be of independent interest. By getting rid of the prune-and-walk step, sliver peeling makes the reconstruction process more parallelizable.
For the same reason, it also allows reconstruction of nonorientable surfaces which is not possible with any of the existing algorithms.
The question of handling non-uniform samples with theoretical guarantees remains open. Our approach in section 5
may very well have provable guarantees for locally uniform
samples. However, without any local uniformity, it is difficult to estimate the local density of the sample which is
required to estimate the ball sizes. Ideas from [FR02] may
be used to convert a non-uniform sample to a locally uniform sample and then apply the method in section 5. Our
approcah does not handle noisy samples, an important case
which remains open.

Appendix A: Proof of Proposition 1
Proof The proof for the closed surface case in [CDR05]
takes the segment xy, considers the closest point projection γ
of xy onto Σ and then (a) puts an upper bound on the length
of γ by a multiple of the length of xy, and (b) bounds the
normal variation on γ. In the argument for (a), the crucial
point is that for p ∈ xy, the segment pp from p to its projection p in Σ is normal to Σ at p and so there is an empty
tangent medial ball B at p whose center is in the ray from
p in the direction of p and its radius is lfs(p ). The difference here is that p may lie on ∂Σ and so pp does not need
to be normal to the surface, but to its bounding curve; still
the same conclusion about the tangent ball holds. Using this
and arguing as in the Figure 6 leads to the conclusion that
length(γ) ≤ 2 x − y . The argument for (b) is the same as
for closed surfaces.

Appendix B: Proof of proposition 3
Proof For the proof by induction on k we add to the conclusion that K1 and K2 contain the same set of tetrahedra, if
any at all, and that the isotopy can be chosen to keep K1 ∩K2
fixed. When k = 1, e and e1 peels the same tetrahedron, say τ.
In this case K = K2 . If e = e1 , we have K1 = K and there is
nothing to prove. If e = e1 , let K1 have the triangles t1 ,t2 of
τ and K have the triangles t3 ,t4 of τ. Since e and e1 are compatible and hence vertex disjoint, the two sets of triangles are
disjoint. Hence t1 ∪ t2 can be deformed to t3 ∪ t4 with an isotopy that can keep all other points of K1 fixed. In essence we
have an isotopy between K1 and K = K2 . Clearly, K1 and
K = K2 contain same set of tetrahedra since both of them
are obtained from K0 by peeling τ.
e1 ,...,ek−1
Now consider k > 1. Let K0 → K1 . First assume that e
peels a tetrahedron that is not peeled by ek . Then it is peeled
by an edge in the sequence e1 , ..., ek−1 . We can apply the inductive hypothesis by which there is a sequence e1 , ..., ek−2

Proposition 11 Let α = κερ and κε ≤ 1/2. Let x be a smooth
point in ∂Bα (P). The angle between the normal of ∂Bα (P)
at x and the normal of Σ at x˜ is at most 2 sin−1 (2/κ).
Proof Consider a point x in the interior facet of ∂Bα (P),
lying on the boundary of Bα (p) for p ∈ P, and its closest
point x˜ on Σ. For convenience write β = ερ. So α = κβ. Because κε ≤ 1/2 then α ≤ ρ/2. We want to first bound the
˜ but outangle ∠pxx.
˜ The sample q closest to x˜ lies in Bβ (x)
side of the medial balls B = B(c, R) and B = B(c , R) tangent to Σ at x,
˜ where R ≡ ρ. See the figure. So p must lie
in cl(B(x, q − x ) − B − B ). Under this situation, ∠pxx˜ is
maximized by the angle θ = ∠vxx˜ as shown in the figure.
Considering the medial ball B , we obtain

compatible with e1 , ..., ek−1 so that K
→ K2 and K1
is isotopic to K2 with the same set of tetrahedra. Since the
isotopy keeps K1 ∩ K2 fixed, the tetrahedron peeled by ek
in K1 is also peelable at ek in K2 . Peeling ek from K1 produces K1 . Peeling the same from K2 produces K2 . We have
K1 and K2 isotopic with the same set of tetrahedra and the
isotopy keeps K2 ∩ K1 fixed. So, the sequence e1 ...ek−2 ek
satisfy the inductive hypothesis.
Next consider the case when e peels the tetrahedron which
is peeled by ek . We claim that e1 , .., ek−1 peel the same sequence of tetrahedra in K as in K0 . If not, let e j be the first
in the sequence which cannot satisfy this claim. Let e j peel
τ in K0 . The only reason why e j cannot peel τ in K is that
it is still incident to more than two triangles. But, that is impossible since e1 , ..., e j−1 peeled same set of tetrahedra in
both and K has a subset of triangles that are in K0 . Let K2

Proof [Proof of Proposition 4.] Let x = x(t) and θ(x(t)) denote this angle. First assume that x(t) is a smooth point in
∂Bα,t (P). We already observed that x(t) remains smooth
in ∂Bα,t (P) for all t ∈ [0, 1]. Let W (t) ⊂ ∂Bα,t (P) be a
sufficiently small smooth neighborhood of x(t). Consider
the map f : W (0) → W (t) given by f (w) = ν(w) + (1 −
t)(ι(w) − ν(w)) where ν : W (0) → Σ is the restriction of the
closest point map to W (0) and ι : ∂Bα (P) → ∂Bα (P) is the
identity. The derivative D f maps the tangent spaces TW (0)
of W (0) to the tangent spaces TW (t) of W (t) and is given by
D f = Dν + (1 −t)(Dι − Dν). Specifically, for a tangent vector τ(0) ∈ TW (0) at x(0) we have τ(t) at x(t) where τ(t) =
D f x(0) (τ(0)) = τx˜ + (1 −t)(τ(0) − τx˜ ) and τx˜ = Dνx(0) (τ(0))
is a tangent to Σ at x.
˜ We see that tangent spaces are linearly
interpolated by t between TW (0) at x(0) and T Σ at x.
˜ Hence
the normals to ∂Bα,t (P) at smooth points are also interpolated linearly by t. It follows that θ(x(t)) is also interpolated
by t between θ(x(0)) and θ(x(1)). Proposition 11 provides
θ(x(0)) ≤ 2 sin−1 (2/κ). Clearly θ(x(1)) = 0. Thus, we have
θ(x(t)) ≤ θ(x(0)) ≤ 2 sin−1 (2/κ).
If x(t) is not a smooth point, a normal in Conv Nx(t) cannot make more than 2 sin−1 (2/κ) angle with any normal on
the boundary of Conv Nx(t) since all these normals make at
most 2 sin−1 (2/κ) angle with the same surface normal nx˜ . It
follows that any normal at x(t) makes at most 4 sin−1 (2/κ)
angle with nx˜ .

Appendix D: Proof of Proposition 8
Proof Let b be the boundary curve of Σ containing x. The
tangent plane at x contains the fiber γx and so nx lies in
a plane orthogonal to γx . Thus, to determine nx one needs
to investigate what the slope of the surface is when moving in the direction orthogonal to γx when seen as a function defined on the tangent plane Tx (the tangent plane at
x). To be precise, say x = (0, 0, 0) and x = (µ, 0, 0), and
consider another y = (µ, Δ, δΔ) in the collar close to x
whose closest point in Σ is y, that is, y ∈ γy . Thus, we have
that tan ∠nx nx = δ when Δ → 0. We assume δ ≥ 0. Let
B = B(c, R) be the tangent ball to b at x with center in γx
and radius R = lfs(x). Since x ∈ Σ then y lies in the cup

that h is second order in Δ while δΔ (the height of y ) is first

Appendix E: Proof of Proposition 9
Proof Let F be formed by samples p, q. Consider the empty
ball B(x, p − x ). The closest point x˜ of x in Σ is on ∂Σ
by our collar extension and x˜ is in B. Since x˜ has a sample
within ερ, the radius of B, p − x , is at most µ + ερ.
Since B intersects Σ and the radius of B is O(ερ), it intersects Σ in a topological ball (apply the argument of Lemma
1.1 [Dey07]). The points p, q ∈ Σ forming the Voronoi facet
F lie on its opposite sides. It means that the plane of F intersects Σ and since it intersects it almost orthogonally, it
intersects ∂Σ as well.
The tangents of ∂Σ and ∂Σµ at points x˜ and x respectively
are parallel by construction. Furthermore, the tangents at all
points of ∂Σ within B vary by O(κε) angle since any two
such points are within O(κερ) distance. So, we measure the
angle between the normal nF and the tangent τx¯ at x¯ where
the plane of F intersects ∂Σ. This angle is within O(κε) of
the angle ∠τx , nF which we want to bound.
Consider the disk at which the plane containing xx¯ and τx¯
intersects B. See Figure 7. Clearly, ∠τx¯ , nF is no larger than
the angle θ as shown in the figure.

Proof First we verify that it is a manifold triangulation
homeomorphic to Σµ . We need to show that each of the
restricted Voronoi face satisfies the topological ball property [ES94]: for Vτ ∈ Vor P, Vτ ∩ Σµ and Vτ ∩ ∂Σµ are topological balls of the appropriate dimension. The proof for the
closed surfaces applies here when there is no intersection
with the boundary. All that is essential is that Voronoi faces
that intersect Σµ do so almost orthogonally [Dey07], which
is also the case here inside the collar according to Proposition 8. So it is only necessary to verify the ball property on
the boundary ∂Σµ . By Proposition 9, ∂Σµ intersects a Voronoi
facet at an angle O(κε) + cos−1 2/3 for κ ≥ 2. This angle is
no more than 50◦ for sufficiently small ε. This fixed bound
is enough to carry out the standard proofs from the literature [Dey07] to establish that ∂Σµ intersects Voronoi facets
and cells with topological ball property. Therefore, Del Σµ (P)
is homeomorphic to Σµ and hence to Σ as Σµ and Σ are isotopic by our construction.
We argue that Del Σµ (P) is indeed isotopic to Σ. Consider
Σ4µ . We project Del Σµ (P) by the closest point map to Σ4µ .
Since the circumradii of the triangles in Del Σµ (P) are at most
2µ, it can be shown that the closest point map ν : Del Σµ (P) →
Σ4µ is injective [ACDL02]. The map also induces an isotopy
between Del Σµ (P) and its image T = ν(Del Σµ (P)) ⊆ Σ4µ . If
we show that T and Σ are isotopic, we are done.
Let us examine the difference between T and Σ both of
which are contained in Σ4µ . Formally we define W = (Σ −
T ). The space |W | cannot have any handle, boundary, or
Möbius bands since Σ does not have them and according to
surface classification theorem Σ and Σ4µ should have same
number of them. Therefore, cl(W ) is a set of cylinders possibly pinched at the points where ∂Σ and ∂T intersect. A
natural deformation retraction from ∂T over these cylinders
to ∂Σ is a witness to an isotopy between T and Σ.
