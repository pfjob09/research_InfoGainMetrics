Abstract
In this paper, a novel concept, Affective Modelling, is introduced to encapsulate the idea of creating 3D models
based on the emotional responses that they may invoke. Research on perceptually-related issues in Computer
Graphics focuses mostly on the rendering aspect. Low-level perceptual criteria taken from established Psychology
theories or identified by purposefully-designed experiments are utilised to reduce rendering effort or derive quality
evaluation schemes. For modelling, similar ideas have been applied to optimise the level of geometrical details.
High-level cognitive responses such as emotions/feelings are less addressed in graphics literatures. This paper
investigates the possibility of incorporating emotional/affective factors for 3D model creations. Using a glasses
frame model as our test case, we demonstrate a methodological framework to build the links between human
emotional responses and geometrical features. We design and carry out a factorial experiment to systematically
analyse how certain shape factors individually and interactively influence the viewer’s impression of the shape of
glasses frames. The findings serve as a basis for establishing computational models that facilitate emotionallyguided 3D modelling.

1. Introduction
The idea of our work originated from Kansei Engineering [Nag95] in the field of Industrial Design. It is a technique
aiming to transform a user’s emotional responses into design
parameters. The method studies how a user "feels"’ about
particular design features such as shapes or materials. With
the links established between the two, the final product containing the relevant design parameters or features is expected
to invoke the corresponding feelings of users. Despite the
apparent relevance to graphics modelling such as creating
forms and shapes of 3D models, there are surprisingly few
literatures addressing this issue from the Computer Graphics perspective. Generally speaking, perceptually-related issues in Computer Graphics focuses mostly on the rendering aspect [Mys02]. Low-level perceptual criteria [Dal93]
taken from established Psychology theories [Lev00] or identified by purposefully-designed experiments are utilised to
reduce rendering effort [VMKK00, CCW03] or derive qualc 2009 The Author(s)

ity evaluation schemes [CMD∗ 00, RFWB07]. In terms of
modelling, the similar approach has been applied to produce
perceptually-optimised polygon meshes [BCP03, LVJ05].
An earlier study [KPC93] indicates that it is viable to incorporate subjective impressions of illumination conditions
for optimising rendering computations. In a more recent
work, Leyvand et al. [LCODL08] develop a beautification
engine driven by subjective aesthetic ratings on human faces.
Our work investigates whether there are also shared affective responses invoked by certain geometrical features. It
serves as a further attempt to add the emotional aspect into
perceptually-related graphics studies.
On the other hand, numerous work on product ergonomics
have been carried out to explore the emotional aspects of
a product. For example, the Kansei approach has been applied to study a wide range of products such as the design of car interiors [JH97], consumer electronics [CCH97],
and industrial equipments [Nak97]. Other researchers fo-

cus on the pleasurable aspect of products in particular and
study how a product can enrich a user’s mental activities [HPT03]. McDonagh-Philip et al. [MPL00] introduced
the concept of soft functionality to describe the emotional
responses or other less tangible aspects that influence how
the user interacted with the products. A product personality profiling method has been developed to elicit these soft
aspects [MH02]. Hsiao et al. [HC06] studied the relationship between product profiles and affective responses across
large, medium, and small products and attempted to uncover
the fundamental dimensions of affective responses to product shapes. They showed that across the three product categories the shape features like curvy lines were more likely to
be perceived as soft, feminine characteristics of the products.
These previous studies analysed the relationship between
product shapes and human emotional responses. However,
most of them studied finished products or prototypes assembled with images of existing product component. The shape
features are qualitatively defined, e.g. sharp or smooth. Although insightful, the findings are difficult to be transformed
to graphics parameters.
In this paper, we explicitly define the shape profile of a
3D object, a glasses frame, using simple lines and Bézier
curves. A factorial experiment is then carried out to characterise how various carefully-defined shape factors individually or interactively affect a user’s emotional responses,
with glasses frames as an exemplary object. The results obtained from multivariate analysis of variances validate some
common perceptions of glasses frame shapes quantitatively.
They also reveal interesting insights to the interactions between shape features. Our work shows an early attempt of
creating 3D models guided by human emotional responses.
2. Methodology
The semantic differential method (SD) developed by Osgood et al. [OST57] is commonly used in Kansei studies
to derive the emotional responses. Bi-polar representatives,
i.e., two adjectives having opposite meanings (e.g. creativeimitative), are selected as the two measuring extremes. Emotional responses are recorded via the means of evaluating the
level of agreement towards the two extreme when the user
are presented with a particular design. This paper employs
the SD method to analyze the links between human emotional responses and the defined shape parameters. Industrial
experts are invited to participate in the selection process of
appropriate adjective sets and shape factors. The psychological investigation is then carried out in the form of a factorial
experiment to study the affective effects of the variation of
shape factors.
2.1. Derive Affective Measures
A total of 59 design-related adjectives were collected from
relevant literatures and design magazines. To reduce the

number of adjectives to be evaluated, we used the KJ method
developed by a Japanese ethnologist, Jiro Kawakita [Scu97].
Three industrial designers were invited and joined with one
of the authors to participate in the KJ clustering session. The
author, as the session chair, led the session in terms of keeping the focus and flow of the discussion. He gave no explicit
instructions on how the adjectives should be clustered. The
session contained two stages. The author and one Taiwanese
industrial designer participated in the first stage, Group and
Naming. It was carried out with the following steps:
1. Each of the 59 adjectives was printed on an individual
card.
2. The author randomly picked out one adjective card. The
designer was then requested to select one adjective card
that has a similar meaning.
3. The author picked out another adjective card and asked
the designer if it had a similar meaning to the pair previously grouped. If it did, it was added to the pair’s group;
and
4. if it was of a different meaning, it formed a new group and
the designer would be asked to select another adjective
card that belongs to the newly-formed group.
5. Step 3 and 4 were repeated until all adjective cards had
been clustered.
6. Adjective groups that described the same concept but had
opposite meanings were re-grouped together.
7. The clustered groups were eventually reduced to five.
The second session, Redistribution, was carried out by the
author with the two designers from the US. The session was
performed with Internet Conferencing. The adjective groups
clustered in the first session were sent over to the two designers electronically. With the author and the two designers
all having the adjective files at hand, the author discussed
the necessary rearrangements of the clusterings. At the end,
they identified five main concepts described by the adjective
groups and their bi-polar representatives (see Fig. 1):

Fig. 1 illustrates the clustered results of the 59 adjectives.
The terms listed in the leftmost column are the five affective measures identified in the KJ sorting process. The central column lists the bi-polar representatives. And the clusterings of the adjectives are listed in the rightmost column.
It is worth noting here that the clusterings cannot possibly
reflect or include each individual’s interpretations over the
adjectives gathered. In our case, indeed, the readers may
have their own interpretations on some of the adjectives collected in this study and how they should have been clustered.
Nonetheless, KJ-sorting is an efficient method to quickly reduce vast amount of information. Much of the outcome is
produced through the cooperation and negotiation among

problem space and generating the expert heuristics for our
work.

2.2. Experiment Design
Factorial design [Mon04] is an experiment technique that allows the experimenter to study the effects of multiple independent variables at the same time. The independent variables are manipulated by the means of adjusting the predefined levels of selected factors. One can examine how
those variables individually or interactively influence the experimental results with the factorial approach. This work
conducts a factorial experiment to characterize how various

shape factors affect a user’s emotional responses towards 3D
glasses frames. The selection of the test elements, i.e., factors, was suggested by the industrial designers collaborated
in this study. The variations of factor were then combined to
form the 3D shape of the test model. As illustrated in Fig. 2,
there are four shape factors related to glasses frames being
investigated in this study: Temporal width, Rim aspect ratio,
Rim corner symmetry, and Rim corner type.

2.3. Model Creation
We pay particular attention to the modelling of rim since it is
the most fundamental part of a glasses frame. The rim profile is modelled with four adjacent cubic Bézier curves. The
rim profile is also confined in a rectangular bounding box as

1814

Rim aspect ratio = height/width
Rim Width

Temporal Width
Rim Height
Corner Type

Figure 2: Selected shape factors for glasses frames

illustrated in Fig. 2. The width and height of the bounding
box are taken as the width and height of the rim. As shown
in Fig. 2, the bounding box contains four regions divided
by the horizontal and vertical central lines. Each region encloses one of the four Bézier curves. The two control points
of the Bézier curve are constrained to move only on the outer
edges (not the central lines) of the bounded region. Because
of the bounding box and the constrained movement of the
control points, the connections between neighbouring curves
maintain tangential (G1) continuity.
Having established the building blocks of the rim, we
are now able to define the corner type and symmetry with
the properties of Bézier curves. The circular corner is defined as when the two control points of the Bézier curve are
placed at the middle of the outer edges of the bounded region. The squared corner is defined as when the two control
points are placed together at the vertex where the two outer
edges meet. Changes of the positions of the control points
and how they affect the corner type are illustrated in Fig. 3.
The corner symmetry is thus defined with the symmetry of
the corner curves. For example, the diagonally symmetrical
corners would have the circular corners at the top-left and
lower-right regions, and, the squared corners at the top-right
and lower-left regions. Because of the way we model the rim
corners, we are able to assign a number to each corner type.
The circular corner can be assigned the number, 0.5, since
the control points are moved to the middle of regional edges.
The squared corner can be assigned the number, 1, since the
control points are moved to the end of the regional edges. In
other words, the corner is parameterized with the distances
travelled by the control points.
After the rim profile is constructed, a sweeping operation
is applied along the profile to build up the volume of the rim.
A similar sweeping modelling technique is employed to construct the temporal. Since we are only interested in the width
of temporal, the profile used for sweeping is heuristically de-

Figure 3: Corner types defined by the control points

fined based on commonly found temporal shapes. The levels
of the four shape factors can then explicitly defined as follows:
• Temporal width: w1 (narrow, 0.125), w2 (wide, 0.75)
• Rim aspect ratio:(height to width ): a1 (0.5), a2 (0.75)
• Rim corner symmetry: s1 (full symmetry), s2 (horizontal symmetry), s3 (vertical symmetry), s4 (diagonal symmetry)
• Rim corner type: t1 (circular), t2 (square)
The numbers specified for the levels of temporal width
and rim aspect ratio are fractions of a unified reference measure: the rim width. That is, w1 is one-eighth, w2 is threefourth, and the height in a1 is one-half of rim width. Our goal
is to examine the interactions between all of the selected factors. The experiment is to be run with a full mixed-level factorial design. Except corner symmetry, which has four levels, the other three factors all contain two levels. Therefore,
the combinations of the factors and levels yield a total of 32
glasses frame models (2 × 2 × 4 × 2). According to the varieties and attributes of the elements, we used Maya [May04] ,
a 3D modeling software package, to build the corresponding
glasses frame models. Four of the 32 glasses frame models
are shown in Fig. 4.

2.4. Experiment Procedures
A total of 30 subjects were recruited to participate in the
experiment. They were undergraduate and graduate students
studying in the University where the author carried out the
research. The glasses frame models were presented to the
participants with a Java-based web application developed by
ourselves. The application allowed the participants to interactively move, drag, and rotate the 3D models. A questionnaire was designed for the participants to fill in with their
emotional responses. The questionnaire lists the labels of

the 32 models constructed earlier. The five affective measures are displayed under each model label. For each affective measure, the corresponding bi-polar adjectives is separated by a 7-position Likert scale, labeled with: slightly
agree, agree, strongly agree, towards each extreme, and the
middle position is labeled with neutral. The experiment was
carried out with the following procedures:
The experimenter firstly explained the purpose of the experiment. The participants were then presented with the
Java-based application. A demonstration was given to show
how to control the 360-degree viewing of the glasses frame
models. Each participant was given three pre-trials to practice the viewing control. The experimenter then handed over
the questionnaire. Each participant was requested to mark
the levels of affective response according to his/her impressions on the shape of the current glasses frame. The experimenter controlled the order of presenting the 3D model. A
random order of the presentation was pre-calculated for each
participant. By doing so, we were able to avoid the possibility of the effects introduced by systematic orderings. The
experiment session lasted approximately one hour.
3. Results and Discussions
We analysed the data with Multivariate Analysis of Variances (MANOVA) [HTAB98]. The aim of the MANOVA
analysis is to identify whether any of the shape factors has a
statistically significant effect in changing the user’s affective
responses towards the glasses frames. A probability measure called p-value calculated from MANOVA determines
the statistical significance. It measures how confident we
can generalise the results derived from the sample to represent the whole population. We follow the convention in
most statistical analysis: If p < 0.05, the corresponding factor produces a statistically significant effect on the product
shape. [Fie05].
In Factorial Design, main effects refer to the influences brought by each individual factor. Fig. 5 shows the
MANOVA results with respect to the main effect of each
factor. The headings of the table are described as follows.
DF stands for Degree of Freedom, i.e. factor levels − 1. F
is a measure of the ratio between the effects caused by the
systematic variations (our manipulations of the factor levels)

corner type produce a significant impact on the participants’
responses on gender connotation. In addition, the interactions between aspect ratio, corner type, and corner symmetry
(i.e. a × t, s × t) also affect the participants’ judgments. We
further examine the means of participants’ responses plotted with respect to the changes of factor levels. As shown In
Fig. 8, the levels of the factors are marked on the horizontal
axis, whereas the vertical axis represents the subject’s responses towards the factor levels. The black dots connected
by the straight lines show the mean responses in accordance
with the factor levels. Since we use a 7-position scale, the
midpoint 4 represents a neutral response. The points above
and below the midpoint represent the tendencies towards the
endpoints of each conceptual measure. When the temporal
width becomes wider, it tends to make the glasses frame look
relatively more masculine. The participants respond similarly to the frame’s aspect ratio. A larger aspect ratio produces a relatively more masculine look. For the corner types,
a more squared corner also makes the glasses frame look
more masculine as compared to a circular one.

Figure 10: Mean plots of the main effects on Design Specialty

3.2. Popularity
As shown in the MANOVA figures, the effects of the aspect
ratio, corner symmetry, and corner type are significant on
popularity. Compound effects can also be seen in the combinations of corner symmetry and corner type as well as aspect ratio, corner symmetry, and corner type. Fig. 9 show
that for aspect ratio the lower level is more common than the
upper level. The responses caused by changing the corner
symmetry are even more apparent. The fully-symmetrical
rim is a lot more common than the other three types of
symmetry. For corner type, the squared corner is also more
commonly seen than the circular one. Regarding the interactions between corner symmetry and type, the trend of the
effects of corner type varies with different corner symmetry.
When the rim is diagonally-symmetrical, changing the corner type does not produce much impact on the participants’
impression on popularity. Changing the corner from circular
to squared type makes the glasses frame more common.

3.3. Design Specialty
All of the four shape factors affect the participants’ responses on the design specialty of the glasses frame. There
is a significant interaction between the aspect ratio, corner
symmetry, and corner type. Fig. 10 shows that the larger temporal width gives the impression of being more original than
the narrow one. The larger aspect ratio, however, looks less
original than the smaller one. In the case of corner symmetry,
the fully-symmetrical rim is considered to be least original
among the three. And the vertically-symmetrical rim produces the most original appearance. For the corner type, the
participants judge the squared corner to be less original than
the circular one.

The glasses frames look more robust to the participants when
they have wider temporals. Overall, the mean responses invoked by the other three factors are below the neutral point.
However, changing their levels does not make a significant
difference.
3.6. Regression Models
In addition to understanding the trends of the user’s emotional responses towards different shape factors, we also
build up computational models of their relationships with
multiple regression analysis as follows:
• Gender connotation = 1.91 + 0.47w + 3.38a + 0.508t −
0.079s1 + 0.117s2 − 0.096s3

3.4. Reflected Value
The participants’ responses on the reflected value are affected by the temporal width and aspect ratio. Although the
corner type and symmetry alone do not produce a significant effect, there is a strong interaction between the two. Fig.
11 shows the trends of the effects. The narrow temporal is
deemed to be more rough and low-valued than the wide one.
The smaller aspect ratio, however, looks more high-valued
to the participants. While the fully-symmetrical rim reflects
a value less than the other three, the vertically-symmetrical
rim gives an impression of being most valuable. For the corner type, the squared corner appears to be relatively more
valuable than the circular one.
3.5. Structural Firmness
The impression of the structural firmness is less influenced
by the shape factors. Only the main effect of varying the temporal width is found to be statistically significant. There is,
however, interaction between the corner symmetry and type
that produces a significant impact. The mean plots for the
main effects (see Fig. 12) indicate that changing the temporal width produces a much steeper line than the other three.

For adding the categorical factor, corner symmetry, into
the linear regression equation, s1 , s2 , and s3 have been used
as three binary dummy variables to represent which of the
categorical levels, diagonal, full, and horizontal symmetries
is "activated". For example, if the glasses has diagonallysymmetrical frames, then s1 = 1, s2 = 0, and s3 = 0. These
five equations characterise the affective responses as the linear combinations of the shape factors studied in our experiment. When a new glasses frame model is designed based on
the combinations of these factors, we can compute the level

of affective responses that it may invoke with these regression equations. And due to the linear nature assumed for the
three factors: temporal width, aspect ratio, and corner type,
one can select a value other than the levels tested in this paper. For example, if the user/designer selects the following
factor values to build up a glasses frame: temporal width =
0.5, aspect ratio = 0.5, corner type = 0.75, and a diagonallysymmetrical rim. These values can be fed into the regression
equations to obtain the levels of the affective responses invoked by it. For example, in the cases of obtaining affective
responses on gender connotation and design specialty:
Gender connotation = 1.91 + 0.47 × 0.5 + 3.38 × 0.5 +
0.508 × 0.75 − 0.079 × 1 + 0.117 × 0 − 0.096 × 0 = 4.137
Design Specialty = 2.29 − 0.457 × 0.5 + 1.71 × 0.5 +
0.471 × 0.75 + 0.254 × 1 + 1.03 × 0 + 0.204 × 0 = 3.524
The glasses frame will give the impression of being
slightly masculine and not so original with the affective levels, 4.137 and 3.524, for gender connotation and design specialty.
3.7. Verification Test
To validate the efficiency of the regression models, we carried out a verification experiment. We generated another 16
models according to the following level settings (see Fig. 13
for four of the models used in the verification experiment):
• Temporal width: w1 = 0.25, w2 = 0.5
• Rim aspect ratio:(height to width ): a1 = 0.375, a2 =
0.625
• Rim corner symmetry: s1 (full symmetry), s2 (horizontal symmetry), s3 (vertical symmetry), s4 (diagonal symmetry)
• Rim corner type: t = 0.75
A total of 14 participants, who did not take part in the first
experiment, were recruited to run the experiment. Each par-

ticipant went through the same experiment procedures except that they were evaluating the glasses frame models with
the new factor level settings. For each model, we computed
the average scores of the five affective measures to be compared with the scores predicted by the regression equations.
It is probably too naïve to claim that the derived regression
model can predict absolute rating scores over the new factor
level settings. Human emotions are complex in nature, and it
is reasonable to expect a more sophisticated model. Since we
employed the bi-polar approach, we verified the regression
models in terms of how accurately it classified the current
glasses frame into the right or left half of the affective scale.
The score, 4, was used as the mid point. If the predicted score
and the observed averaged score are both over or less than 4,
we say that the models predict correctly on the corresponding glasses frames. The verification results are shown in Fig.
14.
In Fig. 14, Mx is the number of test models, pred is the
score predicted by the corresponding regression equation,
and obs is the average score computed from the newly observed data. The wrongly-predicted scores, i.e., the predicted
and the observed scores are not both over or less than 4, are
shaded in the figure. The bottom row shows the accuracy by
dividing the correct predictions with the total number of test
models (16). The results indicate that the regression models perform better than having no model at all(i.e., merely
guessing, accuracy = 50%).

4. Conclusion and Further Work
This paper employs factorial experiment techniques to examine how various shape factors influence users’ responses
to 3D models. The results show that the main and interactive effects of the shape factors are statistically significant in
changing the affective responses. They validate some common perceptions of the glasses frame shapes, e.g. increasing
the temporal width or the aspect ratio makes it look more
masculine; asymmetry produces better design specialty; a
larger temporal width offers a more robust appearance. Interesting insights to the interactions between shape features
have also been obtained. These findings give a support to
computational models that facilitate 3D modelling based on
human emotional responses. They also help the modellers
evaluate the glasses frame shapes. A prototype model related to certain emotional responses can thus be generated
for further modelling refinements. Another potential use of
our experimental findings is the customisation for affective
design. The end user such as clients can express his/her need
of a particular emotional feature of the desired model, and
the model’s shape can be constructed accordingly. The target object in this paper is evaluated on its own. One of the
possible extensions of our work is to incorporate contextual
information, i.e., when the object is in use. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be applied to investigate
other design features such as the materials and colours of a

3D model, provided that the relevant parameters are carefully defined or identified by domain experts. It is worth
noting here that the aim of this work is not to replace, but
to complement the role of 3D modellers. The proposed approach can generate design templates to stimulate the creativity of modellers and improve communications with the
end users. For a more sophisticated geometrical manipulations, one of the possibilities is to integrate Free-Form Deformation (FFD) techniques with this work for interactive
affective 3D modelling.
