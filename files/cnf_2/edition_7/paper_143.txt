Abstract
It is known that the critical points of the distance function induced by a dense sample P of a submanifold Σ of Rn
are distributed into two groups, one lying close to Σ itself, called the shallow, and the other close to medial axis of
Σ, called deep critical points. We prove that under (uniform) sampling assumption, the union of stable manifolds
of the shallow critical points have the same homotopy type as Σ itself and the union of the stable manifolds of
the deep critical points have the homotopy type of the complement of Σ. The separation of critical points under
uniform sampling entails a separation in terms of distance of critical points to the sample. This means that if a
given sample is dense enough with respect to two or more submanifolds of Rn , the homotopy types of all such
submanifolds together with those of their complements are captured as unions of stable manifolds of shallow
versus those of deep critical points, in a filtration of the flow complex based on the distance of critical points
to the sample. This results in an algorithm for homotopic manifold reconstruction when the target dimension is
unknown.

1. Introduction
Surface reconstruction is the problem of producing from a
discrete sample of a surface Σ a concisely represented surface Σ˜ that closely approximates Σ and shares its topology,
provided that the sample is dense enough. Due to its many
applications, this problem has a rich literature spanning several disciplines. In computational geometry a great deal of
attention has been given to algorithms that guarantee topological and geometric accuracy of the output under assumptions on the density of the sample; see e.g. [Boi84, ABE98,
ACK01, ACDL02, APR03, AB99, BC02, BO06] or [CG06]
for a survey. Traditionally, “topological equivalence” has
been interpreted as homeomorphism or even the stronger notion of ambient isotopy. This in particular requires the reconstructed object Σ˜ to also be a manifold and of the same
dimension as the target surface Σ. In this paper, we relax
this interpretation to homotopy equivalence (see [Hat01] for
deﬁnitions). Thus we seek to homotopically reconstruct the
target manifold which consists of ﬁnding a concisely repre-

sented (here polyhedral) subset of Rn that is within small
Hausdorff distance to the original manifold and shares its
homotopy type. We emphasize here that the outcome of a
homotopic reconstruction of a sampled manifold need not
be a manifold itself.
An intuitive idea that has inspired several reconstruction
algorithms [HDD+ 92, ABCO+ 01, BO06] is to interpret the
reconstructed surface as the zero level set of a (signed) distance function which evaluates to (near) zero in all of the
sampled points. The distance function to the target surface
itself is clearly one such function. When the sample is sufﬁciently dense, the distance to the sample closely approximates the distance to the target surface. Thus one may use
the distance function induced by the sample as the starting point for building the distance function that leads to
the the reconstructed surface. Study of distance functions
as a natural approach to surface reconstruction has lead
to the examination of deeper properties of such functions
such as their singularities, gradients, or steepest ascent ﬂows
[Sie99, Ede04].
The flow complex was introduced by Giesen and John
[GJ03] as a tool for geometric modeling though much of

the mathematical foundations behind the ﬂow complex were
well-explored prior to that (see [Gro93] and references
therein). In essence, for a discrete set P ⊂ Rn , the cells of
the ﬂow complex of P is a cell complex that partitions the
entire space into a number of cells each of which is a stable
set (aka stable manifold) under a flow map φP that results
from the integration of a vector ﬁeld vP that generalizes the
gradient of the distance to P [Lie04]. Each cell of the ﬂow
complex is the stable manifold of (set of all points that ﬂow
into) a critical point of the distance function induced by P.
In [GJ02], it was noted empirically that if P is a dense sample of a surface Σ, then the ﬂow complex of P contains a
subcomplex that approximates Σ.
Prior to [GJ02], ﬂow methods were employed for surface reconstruction (e.g. [Ede04]) but the ﬁrst of such algorithms with geometric and topological guarantees was found
by Dey et al. [DGRS05] who proved a sharp separation of
critical points of the distance function induced by surface
samples into two groups. The points in the ﬁrst group, called
the shallow critical points lie close to the surface itself, and
those in the second group, called the deep critical points lie
close to the medial axis of the surface. They further showed
that for surfaces in R3 , the boundary of the union of stable
manifolds of inner or outer deep critical points is homeomorphic to the original surface, provided that the sample is
dense enough and meets extra regularity conditions.
Contributions. We prove important topological properties about the ﬂow complex induced by dense samples of
submanifolds of Rn of arbitrary dimension and codimension. These properties in a way generalize reconstruction result of [DGRS05], albeit with certain reservations. On the
downside, we strengthen the adaptive sampling assumption
of [DGRS05] to the uniform sampling where the sample is a
subset of the manifold with bounded Hausdorff distance to it.
Moreover, the notion of topological equivalence is weakened
from homeomorphism to homotopy equivalence, thus our results translate to algorithms for homotopic reconstruction.
On the upside, we prove that the union of stable manifolds
of the shallow critical points approximates the manifold and
captures its homotopy type while that of the deep ones does
the same for the complement of the manifold. Plus, we show
that this works for any closed submanifold of a Euclidean
space of any dimension not just for (codimension-1) surfaces. Capturing the homotopy type of the complement in
addition to that of the manifold results in a much stronger
topological guarantee. For example, all closed curves, knotted or not, have the same homotopy type and are in fact
homeomorphic, but it is the homotopy types of their complements that allow us to distinguish knotted curves from
each other or from the unknotted ones. The homotopy equivalence of union of stable manifolds of shallow critical points
to the target manifold simply follows from a sequence of
known results on the homotopy types of ﬂow shapes, alpha
shapes, and union of balls [DGJ03, NSW06, Ede95, BG05].
The other homotopy equivalence, i.e. between the union of

stable manifolds of deep critical points and the complement
of the manifold, is the core result of this paper and its raison d’etre. Standard distance ﬂow arguments as those used
in [Lie04, CL06, GRS06] fail in this case; see Section 5. We
thus use a novel proof method that successively applies such
ﬂow arguments on a family of intermediate sets that are indexed by the indices of shallow critical points.
In many scientiﬁc settings, a subspace
of interest from a high dimensional space
is expected to be a manifold or lie close
to one. Naturally occurring data often have
much lower inherent dimension than the
space in which they live. Inferring the
topology of such subspaces based on a collected sample poses a version of the manifold reconstruction
problem in which the dimension of the target manifold is not
known. In fact, it can be the case that the given sample is a
dense sample for multiple submanifolds of various dimensions of the larger space. For example, in the ﬁgure on the
right, a sample of the curve can also be regarded as a sample
for the torus in which the curves is contained and given the
sample alone as input, either the curve or the torus can be returned as a reconstruction of the target manifold. As a result,
in recent years, there has been growing interest in manifold
reconstruction algorithms that are not supplied with a target
dimension (See e.g. [GO07]).
For uniform samples, the separation of critical points,
which is determined in terms of their distance from the target
manifold, translates into a separation in terms of the distance
from the sample itself. In other words, if one sorts the critical points in the order of their distance to the sample, the
shallow critical points make a preﬁx of this ordering. Thus
if one ﬁlters the ﬂow complex by putting together the stable
manifolds, i.e. cells associated to, critical points in all preﬁxes of this ordered sequence, one is guaranteed to reach in
this ﬁltration a shape homotopy equivalent to any manifold
that is represented densely enough by the given sample. As
mentioned above, the union of stable manifolds of the remaining critical points then captures the homotopy type of
the complement of that manifold. Notice that this ﬁltration
is independent of the manifold and is simply a function of
the given sample. Thus in the above example of the curve
on the torus, if the given sample is dense for both the curve
and the torus, the above ﬁltration results homotopic reconstruction of both the curve and the torus, as well as their
complements, in different stages.
Two important remarks are in order:
1. The signiﬁcance of the results of this paper is primarily theoretical as in practice the ﬂow complex is expensive to compute. Numerical issues can affect the structural accuracy of this complex and its exact computation has only been implemented in R3 [Caz06]. This is
in contrast to much more robustly manageable and more
efﬁciently computable structures such as offset surfaces,

alpha-shapes, or witness complexes (See e.g. [CO08]).
Nevertheless, distance functions have been repeatedly
used as the basis of many reconstruction algorithms and
we believe that the stable manifolds of the ﬂow induced
by these functions capture much of the structure of these
functions and elucidate their role in manifold reconstruction.
2. Although the results presented in this paper are stated
for uniform noise-free samples of smooth submanifolds
of Rn , they all generalize to considerably broader settings at the cost of adjustments of constants: noisy (but
uniform) samples can be accommodated using the results of [CL06]. Furthermore, the assumption of the target shape being a smooth manifold can be dramatically
relaxed to allow arbitrary compacts subsets of Rn with
positive µ-reach in which case the sample can be taken as
any ﬁnite (µ, κ)-approximation of the shape for an appropriate choice of κ (See [CCSL06] for the deﬁnitions as
well as a more general separation result). We omit these
generalizations from this manuscript and leave them for
the full-version of this paper.

of non-negative reals) which he also proved to be continuous
in both variables (in fact some of these results on distance
functions were discovered earlier in higher generality on
semi-concave functions [Pet07]). Intuitively, φP (t, x) is the
point y that is reached from following the vector ﬁeld vP for
time interval of length t, starting at x, by inﬁnitesimal movements proportional to the magnitude of vP . The map φP has
the classical properties of a ﬂow map, namely φP (0, x) = x,
φP (s + t, x) = φP (s, φP (t, x)), and for any point x and any
t ≥ 0, vP (φP (t, x)) is the right-derivative of φP (t, x). Lieutier
also proved that hP along any ﬂow orbit, i.e. t → hP (φP (t, x))
is increasing and in addition satisﬁes

2. Background and Preliminaries

The special case where P is ﬁnite is of particular interest
to us and the rest of this section goes over special properties
of the ﬂow maps in this case. Let Vor P and Del P respectively denote the Voronoi and Delaunay complexes induced
by P. For any point x ∈ Rn , we represent by VP (x) the lowest
dimensional face of Vor P that contains x, and by DP (x) the
face in Del P dual to VP (x). The set AP (x) is the vertex set
of DP (x) and dP (x) becomes the closest point on DP (x) to
x. It can be veriﬁed that all points in the relative interior of
the same Voronoi face have the same driver. Since the afﬁne
hulls of a Voronoi face and its dual are orthogonal with total dimension n, they intersect in exactly one point. Thus if
VP (x) and DP (x) intersect, then this intersection consists of
a single critical point which is the driver of x. All critical
points (except for the maximum at inﬁnity) are characterized the same way (as intersection points of duals). Following [GJ03], we make a general position assumption that all
pairs of Voronoi and Delaunay objects that are dual to and
intersect each other, do so in their relative interiors. The index of a critical point c is deﬁned as the dimension of DP (c).

Let P be closed nonempty subset of Rn . The complement
of P is the open set Pc = Rn \ P. For any point x ∈ Pc , let
hP (x) = infy∈P x − y be the distance function deﬁned by P
and let AP (x) = {y ∈ P : x − y = hP (x)}.

For a given ﬂow map φP , the flow orbit of a regular point
x, denoted φP (x) is deﬁned as φP ([0, +∞), x). For a set T
S
we use φP (T ) for x∈T φP (x). Notice that by this deﬁnition
T ⊆ φP (T ).

While the distance function hP is not smooth, it induces
a vector ﬁeld vP over Pc which behaves like the gradient
of hP in the sense that vP (x) = 0 if and only if there is
a unique direction of steepest ascent for hP at x in which
case the direction of this steepest ascent is given by vP (x)
(see [Gro93] for more general statement and details). The
x−dP (x)
vector vP (x) at a point x is characterized by vP (x) = h (x)
,
P
where dP (x), called driver of x is the center of the smallest
enclosing ball of AP (x), or equivalently, the closest point in
conv AP (x), the convex hull of AP (x), to x. The critical points
of hP are those points x for which vP (x) = 0, or equivalently,
x = dP (x) ∈ conv AP (x).

For a critical point c of hP , the set of all points x whose
ﬂow orbit converges to c is called the stable manifold of
c and denoted by Sm(c) = {x : φP (+∞, x) = c}. Although
there is no ﬂow out of a critical point c, we study the orbits of points very close to c. Some of these points ﬂow
into c while other ﬂow away from it. We deﬁne the unstable manifold Um(c) of a critical point c, as the set of all
points into which points arbitrarily close to c ﬂow. Formally,
T
Um(c) = ε>0 φP (B(c, ε)), where B(c, ε) denotes the open
ball of radius ε centered at c. In other words, the unstable
manifold of c consists of c and all the integral lines that start
inﬁnitesimally close to c.

Lieutier [Lie04] proved that if Pc is bounded, then Euler
schemes deﬁned by vP on Pc uniformly converge and this results in a flow map φP : R+ × Pc → Pc (where R+ is the set

Proposition 1 Let P be ﬁnite. For a critical point c of hP ,
Um(c) = φP (VP (c)).

The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we
formally introduce the ﬂow map φP induced by a point set P
as well as the resulting ﬂow complex. In Section 3 we prove
a slightly different version of the critical points separation
result of [DGRS05] for uniform samples of submanifolds of
Rn of arbitrary dimension. In Section 4 we show that the
union of stable manifolds of the shallow critical points capture the homotopy type of the manifold. Then in Section 5
we prove the corresponding result for the deep critical points
and the complement of the manifold. Concluding remarks
are provided in Section 6.

ble and unstable manifolds of critical points and their union
and intersections are ﬂow tight. Let CP be the set of critical points of hP induced by P (including the critical point
at inﬁnity). The (stable) flow complex of P, denoted Sfc P
is the collection of stable manifolds of all critical points
in CP . Generically, the cell associated to an index k critical point is a topological open k-ball. Moreover, if for critical points c, c ∈ CP , c ∈ ∂ Sm(c ), then Sm(c) ⊂ ∂ Sm(c ).
The following lemma states an important structural property
of the stable and unstable ﬂow complex that follows from
the correctness of the algorithms for computing these complexes [Sad06, BDGa08].
Lemma 1 If for c ∈ CP , ind c = k, then every critical point
c ∈ ∂ Sm(c) has index less than k, provided that Sm(c) does
not intersect the (n − k − 1)-skeleton of Vor P. Under the
same assumption, if c ∈ ∂ Um(c ), then ind c < ind c.
All but a measure-0 set of points P satisfy the requirement
that Sm(c) must stay clear from faces of Vor P of dimension
n − k − 1 or smaller (see [Sad06]).
Terminology. For the rest of this paper, by a manifold we
refer to a C2 -smooth closed submanifold Σ of Rn of arbitrary
codimension. The medial axis M(Σ) of Σ consists of points
in space with 2 or more closest points in Σ. The reach of
Σ is the minimum distance of any point of M(Σ) to Σ. The
C2 -smoothness of Σ implies that its reach is strictly positive.
Any point x ∈ M(Σ), has a unique closest point xˆ in Σ. The
half-line bounded at xˆ through x hits M(Σ) for the ﬁrst time
at a point xˇ (or at inﬁnity).
A point set P ⊂ Σ is a uniform ξ-sample of Σ if ∀x ∈
Σ ∃p ∈ P : x − p ≤ ξ. For a given parameter r ≥ 0, the
S
union of balls p∈P B(p, r) is denoted by B(r) (P). The αshape of P of parameter r, denoted K (r) (P) is the underlying
space of restriction of Del P to B(r) (P) (see [Ede95]). The
flow shape of P for parameter r, denoted F (r) (P) is the union
of stable manifolds of critical points at distance ≤ r from P
(see [DGJ03]).
3. Shallow versus deep critical points
For any point x ∈ Rn \(Σ∪M(Σ)) let µ(x) = x−
ˇ xˆ . If xˇ is at
x−xˆ
< 1,
inﬁnity, then µ(x) = ∞. Otherwise, the ratio 0 < x−
ˇ xˆ
is a relative measure of how close to Σ or M(Σ) the point x
is. It turns out [DGRS05,CL06] that when a (possibly noisy)
sample P of Σ satisﬁes some density requirements, then critical points of hP are distributed, according to the above measure, into two distinguishable groups, one lying very close
to Σ and the other to M(Σ). We state an essentially weaker
version of the lemma that is formulated for uniform samples.
A proof can be found in the Appendix. Variants of this result
for noisy samples, or for surfaces of positive µ-read can be
found in [CL06] and [CCSL06].
Theorem 1 Let
√ P be an ετ-sample of a manifold Σ of reach
τ with ε ≤ 1/ 3. Then for every critical point c of hP , either

c− cˆ ≤ ε2 τ, or c− cˆ ≥ (1−2ε2 )τ. In the former case we
call c a shallow critical point and in the latter a deep critical
point.
The following Corollary is a technical improvement of
Proposition 7.1 in [CL06] or Lemma 3.3 in [NSW06].
Corollary 1 Let
√ P be an ετ-sample of a manifold Σ of reach
τ with ε ≤ 1/ 3. Then, for every shallow critical point c of
hP , hP (c) ≤ 5/3 · ετ, and for every deep critical point c of
hP , hP (c ) ≥ (1 − 2ε2 )τ.
Proof. Let c be a shallow critical point of hP and let λ =
c − cˆ /τ. Since c is shallow, λ ≤ ε2 . Since µ(c) ≥ τ, by
Lemma 8, hP (c) ≤ (ε, λ)τ. Therefore
hP (c) ≤

λ2 + ε2 (1 + λ) · τ ≤
1 + 2ε2 · ετ ≤

=

ε4 + ε2 (1 + ε2 ) · τ

5
· ετ.
3

On the other hand, if c is a deep critical point, by Theorem
1, c − cˆ ≥ µ(c ) − 2ε2 τ ≥ (1 − 2ε2 )τ. The proof follows
from the fact that hP (c ) ≥ c − cˆ .
For any 0 ≤ δ < 1, the δ-tubular neighborhood of
a manifold Σ of reach τ is deﬁned as the set Σδ =
{x ∈ Rn : x − xˆ ≤ δτ}. Notice that M(Σ) ⊂ Σcδ .
The following statement is classical. A proof is supplied
in the Appendix for completeness.
Lemma 2 For any 0 ≤ δ < 1, cl Σcδ is homotopy equivalent
to Σc . In fact, the former is a strong deformation retract of
the latter.
The following lemma is an adaptation of a similar lemma
from [GRS06] for uniforms samples. The proof is provided
in the Appendix.
Lemma 3 Let P√
be an ετ-sample of a manifold Σ of reach τ
with ε ≤ 1/(1 + 2). Then, cl Σcδ is ﬂow-tight under the ﬂow

ε
ε
< δ < 1 − ε − 1−ε
. In particular this is true
φP , for any 1−ε
for δ = 1/2.

2

The above lemma implies that union of stable manifolds
of shallow critical points is contained in Σδ for δ = ε2 /(1 −
ε) thus providing the Hausdorff distance guarantee for our
homotopic reconstructions. Alternatively, one can replace Σδ
with a union of balls of an appropriately small radius centered at all sample points and show that the complement of
the this union is ﬂow tight under φP (See e.g. [CL06]).
4. Homotopy Type of the Manifold
In this section we show that in a dense enough sample of
a submanifold of Rn , the union of stable manifolds of the
shallow critical points has the same homotopy type as the
manifold itself. This statement follows from the following
sequence of results.

Lemma 4 [NSW06] Let Σ be a manifold of reach τ and let P
be an ετ-sample of Σ for any ε ≤ 12 3/5. Then B(r) (P) deformation retracts (and is in particular homotopy equivalent)
to Σ, for any 2ετ < r < 3/5 · τ.

the lowest-dimensional Voronoi face that contains c, c is the
driver of the points in V . Consequently, if x = c is a point in
V ∩U, dP (x) = c and since U is ﬂow-tight for φP , we have

Lemma 5 [Ede95] For any r ≥ 0, B(r) (P) and the α-shape
K (r) (P) are homotopy equivalent.

Now, deﬁne the map ρr : Vr → ∂Vr (where ∂Vr is deﬁned relative to the afﬁne hull of Vr ) as ρr (x) = x + t(x − c) for the
smallest t ≥ 0 such that ρr (x) ∈ ∂Vr . In other words, ρr (x) is
the point at which the ray shot from x in the direction x − c
hits the boundary of Vr . Since Vr is convex (it is the intersection of V and B(c, r) which are both convex), it is easy to see
that the map ρr is continuous (it is a central projection from
a point in a convex set to the boundary of the convex set) and
because of the assumption that U ∩ B(c, r) ⊂ V this implies
that the retraction map ρ∗r : U → U \Vr deﬁned below is also
continuous.

Lemma 6 [DGJ03,BG05] For any r, the ﬂow shape F (r) (P)
and the α-shapes K (r) (P) are homotopy equivalent.
Theorem 2 Let Σ be a manifold of reach τ and let P be an ετsample of Σ for ε ≤ 12 3/5. Then Σ is homotopy equivalent
to the union U of stable manifolds of shallow critical points
of hP .
Proof. For a critical point c of hP , by Corollary 1 hP (c) ≤
5/3 · ετ if c is shallow and hP (c) ≥ (1 − 2ε2 )τ if c is deep.
For ε < 12 3/5 the latter bound is strictly greater than the
former and therefore there is a positive value r for which
hP (c) < r for every shallow critical point c and hP (c ) > r
for every deep critical point c . Thus the ﬂow shape F (r) (P)
is precisely the union of stable manifolds of shallow critical
points of hP with respect to Σ. Lemmas 4, 5, 6 now imply
that this union is homotopy equivalent to Σ.
5. Homotopy Type of the Complement of the Manifold
In this section we prove that the union of stable manifolds
of deep critical points has the homotopy type of Σc using
the continuity of the ﬂow map φP . The technique is inspired
from the work of Lieutier [Lie04]. A proof can be found
in [Sad06] (Theorem 4.20, page 111).
Theorem 3 Let P be a ﬁnite set of points in Rn . If for sets
Y ⊂ X ⊂ Rn , X and Y are both ﬂow-tight for φP , i.e. φP (X) =
X and φP (Y ) = Y , and if X \ Y is bounded, and, ﬁnally, if
there is a constant c > 0 for which vP (x) ≥ c for all x ∈
X \Y , then X and Y are homotopy equivalent.
A difﬁculty in using the above theorem is that φP is proven
in [Lie04] to be continuous on Pc as long as it is a bounded
set. This can be overcome by clipping the space with a very
large ball, thus letting P0 = P ∪ Bc where B is a very large
ball satisfying P ⊂ 15 B. It can then be veriﬁed that within 12 B,
φP and φP0 agree which is enough for what we want to prove.
In the sequel CΣ denotes the set of shallow critical points of
P where P is an ετ-sample of a manifold Σ of reach τ. The
value of ε is determined later. For shorthand, we write S for
Σc as well Sδ for Σcδ .
Lemma 7 Let c be a critical point of hP and let U ⊆ Rn
be a ﬂow-tight set for φP with c ∈ U. Let V = rel intVP (c).
For r ≥ 0, let Vr = V ∩ B(c, r). Then for every r ≥ 0, if U ∩
B(c, r) ⊂ V , then U \Vr is ﬂow-tight for φP and U and U \Vr
have the same homotopy type.
Proof. We build a deformation retraction from U to U \ Vr .
Since c is a critical point and V is the relative interior of

which gives us a straight line homotopy from the identity
map of U to the retraction ρr .
If U ∩ B(c, r) ⊂ V , then for any y ∈ Vr ∩ U, only points
in Vr can ﬂow into y. In other words, y = φP (t, x) for some
t ≥ 0 and x ∈ U implies that x ∈ Vr . Therefore, all ﬂow lines
that are affected by removal of Vr from U start in Vr . But we
saw above that each such ﬂow line loses an initial segment
in U \Vr . Thus U \Vr is ﬂow tight for φP .
S
Theorem 4 Let ε ≤ 12 3/5. Let S˜ = c∈C\CΣ Sm(c) be the
union of stable manifolds of all deep critical points of hP
with respect to Σ. Then S˜ is homotopy equivalent to S.

Proof. Let UΣ = c∈CΣ Um(c) be the union of unstable manifolds of all shallow critical points and let U = (Sδ ∪UΣ ) ∩ S˜
for δ = 1/2. We show that U Sδ which proves this theorem
since Sδ S by Lemma 2. First notice that U is a ﬂow-tight
set. This is because Sδ and UΣ are both ﬂow-tight and so is
˜
S.
Recall that the index of a critical point c, ind c, is
dim DP (c), i.e. the dimension of the Delaunay face dual
to the lowest dimensional Voronoi face of Vor P that contains c. Equivalently ind c = |AP (c)| − 1. Let CΣi , i = 0, . . . , n
denote the set of shallow critical points of index i. Thus
CΣ = CΣ0 ∪ · · · ∪ CΣn . We deﬁne for every 0 ≤ i < n the set

In other words, Ui is the restriction to S˜ of the union of the

U1 , etc. e) We finally arrive at Sδ .

(by Theorem 1) and because Sδ is ﬂow tight for φP , every
ﬂow path that reaches Sδ belongs to the stable manifold of
˜ Also, notice that
some critical point in Sδ . Therefore Sδ ⊂ S.
U0 = S˜ and Un = Sδ because shallow critical points are not
included in S˜ and the unstable manifold of a critical point of
index n, i.e. a maximum is the critical point itself.
To complete the proof, we show by induction on i that
all Ui ’s, i = 0, . . . , n, are homotopy equivalent and this will
prove the Theorem. To this end, ﬁrst observe that all Ui ’s
are ﬂow-tight for φP by deﬁnition. For a base case, we show
that U0 and U1 are homotopy equivalent. Observe that every
point x ∈ U0 \ U1 belongs to the unstable manifold of some
critical point in CΣ0 , i.e. a minimum which is simply a sample point in P. Since U0 and U1 are ﬂow tight and U0 \ U1
is bounded (by being contained in Σδ ), it sufﬁces to show
that vP (x) > c for some c > 0, regardless of the choice
of x ∈ U0 \ U1 . Recall that vP (x) = (x − dP (x))/hP (x). If
VP (x) ∩ DP (x) = ∅, the distance between the driver dP (x)
which is contained in DP (x) and x is bounded from below with the distance between VP (x) (which contains x) and
DP (x). Let ζ denote the smallest distance between any pair
of dual Delaunay and Voronoi objects that do not intersect.
Since x ∈ Σδ which is a bounded set and because P ⊂ Σδ , we
get
vP (x) =

x − dP (x)
ζ
.
≥
hP (x)
diam Σδ

If, on the other hand, VP (x) ∩ DP (x) = {c}, then x ∈ Um(c).
Since x ∈ U0 \ U1 , c has to have index 0 and therefore c =
dP (x) and vP (x) = 1.
Thus we assume that U0 · · · Ui and prove that Ui
Ui+1 . We do this in two stages. First we construct a set Ui
by removing a neighborhood of every index-i shallow critical point in such a way that Ui is still ﬂow tight for φP . We
then show that Ui Ui Ui+1 (See Figure 1). The construction of Ui uses Lemma 7. We thus remove for each shallow
critical point c a neighborhood B(c, rc ) from Ui for which

rc > 0 is chosen small enough so that B(c, rc ) ∩Ui ⊂ VP (c).
This is the case unless the unstable manifold of some other
shallow critical point c reaches arbitrarily close to c and is
not contained in Um(c). Lemma 1 now implies that in this
case ind c < ind c. But the unstable manifolds of shallow
critical points of index less than i = ind c are not included
in Ui . Thus by Lemma 7 we can remove a neighborhood of
every shallow critical point of index i from Ui to get a set Ui
that is ﬂow-tight for φP and is homotopy equivalent to U0 .
Next we show that Ui
Ui+1 . For this we use Theorem 3. Since Ui and Ui+1 are both ﬂow-tight for φP , all we
need to do is to ﬁnd a lower bound for vP (x) for points
x ∈ Ui \Ui+1 . For any such point x, the driver dP (x) is contained in DP (x). There are two cases to consider; depending
on whether VP (x) and DP (x) intersect or not.
If VP (x) ∩ DP (x) = ∅ then as argued above vP (x) ≥
ζ/(diam Σδ ). On the other hand if VP (x) and DP (x) do intersect, their intersection will (by deﬁnition) be a critical point
c which coincides with dP (x). In this case x ∈ Um(c).
Notice that c cannot be a deep critical point since these
critical points and their unstable manifolds are contained in
S1−2ε2 ⊂ Sδ which is ﬂow-tight for φP . Thus c is a shallow
critical point. But in that case c must have index ≤ i since unstable manifolds of shallow critical points of index i + 1 and
higher are included in Ui+1 while c ∈ Ui \Ui+1 . Therefore
S

vP (x) =

Theorem 3 now implies that Ui Ui+1 . The proof follows
from the observation that Σδ ⊂ UΣ and therefore S˜ ⊂ Sδ ∪UΣ
˜
implying that U = S.
The following corollary immediately follows from Corollary 1, Theorem 2, and Theorem 4. In essence, it enables us
to reconstruct all the manifold a given sample densely represents (see Figure 2).

6. Conclusions
In this paper, we proved that the separation of critical points
of a smooth submanifold of Rn leads to a very natural way
of homotopic reconstruction of the submanifold and its complement. Combined with the fact that this separation can be
formulated in terms of the distance from the sample, one obtains a way of homotopic reconstruction of all submanifolds
that are represented densely enough by the input sample.
The main result of this paper generalizes to allow noisy
samples, i.e. discrete point sets which are within a small
enough Hausdorff distance of the manifold. Using the original separation result of [DGRS05], Theorem 4 can be generalized to allow adaptive samples, where the sampling density varies with the local feature size. The proof essentially
remains unchanged modulo using the adaptive analogue of
3 proven in [GRS06]. For adaptive noisy samples, one can
achieve a similar result using a corresponding separation theorem of [CL06]. However, we know of no analogue for Theorem 2 or Corollary 2 under adaptive sampling. The obstacle
in this case is that the union of stable manifolds of shallow
critical points may fail to be a flow shape, meaning that the
shallow and deep critical points are not separated in terms
of their distance to the sample. Consequently, the homotopy
equivalence of ﬂow shapes and alpha shapes (Lemma 6) may
seize to hold.

manifold, consisting of stable manifolds of shallow critical points (with respect to the curve). The scattered white points are
deep critical points whose stable manifolds are not included. Right: the sample taken from the curve is dense enough for the
torus surface to reconstruct it as a union of stable manifolds of shallow critical points (with respect to the torus). As can be
seen the complements of these manifolds have the right homotopy type. In particular, the complement of the torus knot shows
that the given curve is knotted.

Appendix A: Some Missing Proofs

The following lemma encapsulates some required calculations
needed in the proof of Theorem 1.
Lemma 8 Let τ be the reach of a submanifold Σ of Rn and let P
be an ετ-sample of Σ. Let x ∈ Rn \ (Σ ∪ M(Σ)) be a point satisfying

where (ε, λ) =

λ2 + ε2 (1 + λ). Then,

1. AP (x) ⊂ L(x). In particular, the points in AP (x) are within distance (ε, λ)τ from x.
2. L(x) ⊂ B (x, rµ0 (ε, λ)τ) ⊆ B (x, r(ε, λ)τ) where rµ0 (ε, λ) =

3. L(x) is contained in a cone with apex x, axis xˆ − x, and half-angle
ψ where ψ = ψ(ε, λ) = arcsin (r(ε, λ)/ (ε, λ)).
Proof of Lemma 8. The interiors of both Bµ and Bτ are disjoint from
Σ. By the sampling assumption, there is a sample point in the ball
Bε = B(x,
ˆ ετ). Thus the closest point in P to x is within distance
from x, where is the distance between x and y, where y is a farthest
point from p in the set L0 = Bε \ (Bµ ∪ Bτ ). Notice that is an upper
bound for hP (x). Figure 3 shows a planar section of this setting.
In the ﬁgure, the region L0 is shaded with the darkest gray. Let B
denote the ball B(x, ). Since P does not intersect Bµ or Bτ , AP (x)
must be contained in the region
L1 = L(x) = B \ (Bµ ∪ Bτ ).
Let z be a point in this region farthest away from xˆ and let r = xˆ −
z . Let γ be the angle between y − xˆ and the hyper-plane tangent to
Σ at xˆ and normal to x − x.
ˆ It can be easily seen from Figure 3 (right)
that sin γ = ε/2.
To simplify notation, let us take τ as unit length. Since the angle

If the radius of B is less than R, then B \ Bµ is strictly contained in the open half-spaces of Rn \ H that contains x.
ˆ Since
x ∈ H, this implies that x ∈ conv(B \ Bµ ) which further entails that
x ∈ conv AP (x). Since dP (x) ∈ conv AP (x), this would imply that
(xˇ − x, vP (x)) < π/2. In particular, x cannot be a critical point if

µ2 − (µ − λ)2 > λ2 + ε2 (1 + λ).

To complete the proof, we need to only show that the angle β =

between z and the line supporting the segment xx.

sin β ≤ r/l = sin ψ.

Proof of Theorem 1. For simplicity we scale the distances so as
to have τ = 1. Refer Figure 3 in the proof of Lemma 8 (Appendix
A). First observe that if cˇ is at inﬁnity, the open halfspace whose
boundary is tangent to Σ at cˆ and contains c, is disjoint from Σ and
therefore from P. This immediately implies that c cannot be a critical point. Thus we assume that cˇ is at ﬁnite distance from c.

by
r(x) =

xˆ + δτ · (x − x)/
ˆ x − xˆ
x

x ∈ Σc \ cl Σcδ
x ∈ cl Σcδ

The map r is continuous on Σc \ cl Σcδ since (x − x)/
ˆ x − xˆ changes
continuously with xˆ (because the surface is smooth), the map x → xˆ
is continuous because the only points of discontinuity of this map
are medial axis points of which there are none in Σc \ cl Σcδ . The
continuity of r on all of its domain follows from a gluing argument
using the fact that the points on the boundary of Σcδ are mapped to
themselves both with the identity map and with the mapping x →

ˆ x − xˆ .

cos α ≥

which implies the statement of the lemma.
Proof of Lemma 3. Take a point x in the boundary of Sδ . For the
statement of the theorem to hold, it sufﬁces to for the angle α as
deﬁned by Lemma 9 to be smaller than π/2 or equivalently cos α >
0. Thus as long as δ < 1, by the same Lemma, it sufﬁces to have
2δ(1 − δ − ε) − ε2 > 0.

If we now deﬁne the map R : [0, 1] × Σc → cl Σcδ as
R(t, x) =

(1 − t)x + tr(x)
x

x ∈ Σc \ cl Σcδ
x ∈ cl Σcδ ,

the map R is a straight-line homotopy from the identity of Σc to the
retraction map r.
