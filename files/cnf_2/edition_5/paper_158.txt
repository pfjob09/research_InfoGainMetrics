Abstract
Discrete Laplace–Beltrami operators on polyhedral surfaces play an important role for various applications in
geometry processing and related areas like physical simulation or computer graphics. While discretizations of the
weak Laplace–Beltrami operator are well-studied, less is known about the strong form. We present a principle for
constructing strongly consistent discrete Laplace–Beltrami operators based on the cotan weights. The consistency
order we obtain, improves previous results reported for the mesh Laplacian. Furthermore, we prove consistency
of the discrete Willmore energies corresponding to the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operators.

1. Introduction
Discrete Laplace–Beltrami operators on polyhedral surfaces
are a key ingredient to various applications in geometry processing, including parametrization, modeling, editing, fairing, shape analysis, interpolation, segmentation, remeshing, compression, and matching [DGSW08, LZ09, RBG∗ 09,
SB09, BKP∗ 10]. An important aspect of the construction of
discrete differential operators is consistency: does the discrete operator converge to the corresponding continuous operator under suitable refinement? We distinguish between
strong and weak consistency, depending on whether the
strong form (∆ : C2 → C0 ) or the weak form (∆ : H01 → H −1 )
of the Laplace–Beltrami operator is approximated.
Whereas the (strong) Laplace–Beltrami operator is defined for Riemannian C2 -manifolds, its weak form requires
less regularity of the manifold. A rigorous definition of
the weak Laplace–Beltrami operator on polyhedral surfaces is detailed in [War06]. Discretizing this operator with
piecewise-linear finite elements on a polyhedral surface
leads to the popular cotan weights [PP93]. Convergence of
solutions of the discrete Dirichlet problem was shown by
Dziuk [Dzi88] for the case of inscribed polyhedral surfaces
and by Hildebrandt et al. [HPW06] in a more general setting. Furthermore, in [HPW06] it was analyzed under what
conditions the weak Laplace–Beltrami operators of polyhedral surfaces converge to their counterparts on smooth surc 2011 The Author(s)

faces. For many applications, a discretization of the strong
Laplace–Beltrami operator is needed, e.g. for approximation
of the mean curvature vector. Based on the cotan weights,
various constructions of discrete Laplacians have been proposed, see [WBH∗ 07, LZ09, RBG∗ 09, BKP∗ 10] and references therein. The cotan Laplacians satisfy structural properties that mimic properties of the continuous operator and are
useful for applications, see [DMSB99, WMKG07]. Strong
consistency of these operators could only be established for
special types of meshes [Xu04] and counter-examples to
strong consistency have been reported [Xu04, HPW06].
Recently, Belkin et al. [BSW08] have introduced a
strongly consistent discretization of the Laplace–Beltrami
operator, called the mesh Laplacian. The construction is
based on a discretization of the heat kernel and is related to graph Laplacians used in data analysis and maschine learning [HAvL05, BN08]. The consistency results
have been generalized by Belkin et al. [BSW09] to point
clouds in Rd and by Dey et al. [DRW10] to convergence of
Laplace spectra. The heat kernel signature proposed by Sun
et al. [SOG09] is a prominent example of an application of
the mesh Laplacian in geometry processing.
The Willmore energy [Wil93] is an nonlinear geometric functional that is used in geometry processing for fairing [HP07, WBH∗ 07] and hole filling [CDD∗ 04, BS05]. It
is closely related to the bending energy of elastic thin plates

K. Hildebrandt & K. Polthier / On approximation of the Laplace–Beltrami operator and the Willmore energy of surfaces

[WBG∗ 08] and the Canham-Helfrich model of thin bilipid
membranes [BNSP10]. The Willmore energy of a smooth
surface is linked to the Laplace–Beltrami operator, since it
equals the L2 -norm of the Laplacian of the embedding of the
surface. To the best of our knowledge, no consistent discrete
Willmore energy for polyhedral surfaces (that does not use
additional information like quadratically converging surface
normals) has been proposed so far.
Contributions. We present a principle for constructing
strongly consistent discrete Laplace–Beltrami operators
based on the cotan weights. The core of our approach is to
test the weak Laplace–Beltrami operator with certain functions that we call r-local functions. Among other properties,
an r-local function at a point v has unit L1 -norm and its support is contained in the geodesic ball of radius r around v.
For closely inscribed polyhedral surfaces and interpolating
piecewise linear functions, we obtain error estimates in the
L∞ -norm that depend on r and the mesh size h; for convergence one has to choose r asymptotically larger than h.
Whereas the evaluation of the cotan Laplacians at a vertex
requires only the 1-ring, our discrete Laplacians need a region with radius r. In this respect, our construction shares
similarities with the mesh Laplacian. However, the consistency order we obtain improves the rates reported for the
mesh Laplacian. As a direct consequence of the strong consistency of the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operators, we obtain estimates for the pointwise approximation of the mean
curvature vector field of a surface. We show consistency of
the corresponding discrete Willmore energies, i.e. we prove
error estimates for the approximation of the Willmore energy of smooth surfaces by such discrete Willmore energies
of polyhedral surfaces.

i.e. δM (y) = x − y R3 . Then the straight line passing
through x and y meets M orthogonally; thus, x is called an orthogonal projection of y onto M. In general, x is not unique
by this property. However, there exists an open neighborhood UM of M in R3 such that every point of UM has a
unique orthogonal projection onto M. The induced projection map Π : UM → M is smooth, a proof of this is contained
in a note by Foote [Foo84]. We say that a polyhedral surface
Mh is inscribed to a smooth surface M if all vertices of Mh
are on the surface M and that Mh is closely inscribed to M if
Π|Mh , the restriction of Π to Mh , is a bijection. Under these
assumptions, the map Π|Mh is bi-Lipschitz, see [War06]. In
the following, we assume that Mh is closely inscribed to M,
and, for simplicity, we denote the map Π|Mh by π.

Figure 1: An illustration of the map between the smooth surface and the polyhedral surface is shown.
Metric distortion. The standard scalar product of R3 induces a metric g on M and a metric gh on Mh . The metric
g is Riemannian and gh is flat in the interior of all triangles
and edges and has conical singularities at the vertices. To
compare the two metrics, we pullback gh to M, i.e. we consider the metric
gˆh (X,Y ) = gh (dπ X, dπY )

2. Laplace–Beltrami Operator on Polyhedral Surfaces
In this section, we review previous results on the approximation of the Laplace–Beltrami operator and introduce our
notation. We consider polyhedral surfaces that approximate
a smooth surface in R3 , where by a polyhedral surface we
mean a finite set of planar triangles in R3 that are glued together in pairs along the edges such that the resulting shape
is a two-dimensional manifold. Both surfaces are assumed
to be compact, connected, and oriented. We denote smooth
surfaces by M and polyhedral surfaces by Mh , and if we refer
to both types of surfaces, we denote the surface by M.
Projection map. To construct a map between M and a neighboring polyhedral surface Mh , we use the orthogonal projection onto the smooth surface. This map is commonly used,
see [Dzi88], [MT04], and [HPW06]. The distance function δM : R3 → R+
0 is defined as
δM (y) = inf x − y
x∈M

R3 .

(1)

Since M is compact, for every y ∈ R3 there is at least
one point x ∈ M that attains the minimum distance to y,

on M. The metric distortion tensor A measures the distortion
between g and gˆh . It is uniquely defined (almost everywhere
on M) as the g-symmetric tensor field A, that satisfies
gˆh (X,Y ) = g(A X,Y )
for all smooth vector fields X,Y on M. In [HPW06], a closed
form representation of A in terms of the curvature of M, the
distance of corresponding points on M and Mh , and the deviation of the surface normals at corresponding points on M
and Mh was derived and used to prove that if a sequence
of polyhedral surfaces converges to a smooth surface in the
Hausdorff distance, then the metrics of the polyhedral surfaces converge to the metric of the smooth surface if and
only if the surface normals converge.
Bounds on the approximation error for various metric
properties of M from corresponding properties of Mh can be
derived from estimates on the metric distortion. The following lemma states three such estimates that were presented
in [HPW06, War06]. We start with some notation. For a triangle Th of a polyhedral surface Mh , let rcirc (Th ) denote the
circumradius of Th and let rin (Th ) denote the inner radius

Furthermore, for any g-symmetric tensor field A, we denote
by A ∞ the essential supremum over all x ∈ M of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of A at x.

The estimates bound the distortion of the metric, the volume form, and, as we will see below, the weak Laplace–
Beltrami operators in the operator norm.

spaces on polyhedral surfaces, we refer to [War06]. For simplicity, we denote both the weak and the strong Laplace–
Beltrami operator by ∆ and rely on the context to make
the distinction. The weak Laplace–Beltrami operator on a
smooth or polyhedral surface M is the continuous linear
operator that maps any u ∈ H01 (M) to the distribution ∆u,
which lies in H −1 (M), the dual space of H01 (M), and is
given by
∆u|ϕ = −

Mh , and for any function v on Mh , we denote by vˆ the function on M that satisfies vˆ ◦ π = v. It was shown in [War06]
that the pullback of functions induces an isomorphism of the
Sobolev spaces H 1 (M) and H 1 (Mh ). Therefore, to compare
∆ and ∆h , we can pullback ∆h to M by setting
∆ˆ h u|ϕ = ∆h u ◦ π|ϕ ◦ π
for any ϕ ∈ H01 (M). The operator ∆ˆ h is explicitly given by
√
∆ˆ h u|ϕ = − g(A−1 ∇u, ∇ϕ) det A dvol,
M

and the distance of ∆ and ∆ˆ h in the norm of the space of continuous linear operators from H01 (M) to H −1 (M) is bounded

Piecewise linear functions. Let Sh denote the finite dimensional subspace of H 1 (Mh ) consisting of all continuous
functions on Mh that are linear in each triangle of Mh , and
let Sˆh be the space that contains any function vˆ ∈ H 1 (M) that
is a pullback of a function v in Sh . For any continuous function u on M, there are unique functions uh ∈ Sh and uˆh ∈ Sˆh
that interpolate u at the vertices of Mh . The following lemma
provides an estimate for the interpolation error that we will
use in the next section.

of u. Then
∇(u − uˆh )

where the constant C depends only on M and the shape regularity of Mh .
Proof Consider a triangle Th of Mh and let T ⊂ M be the
projection of Th onto M. Then u ◦ π |Th is in C2 (Th ) and uh |Th
is the linear function that interpolates u at the vertices of Th .
Since Th is a flat triangle, we can use standard estimates for
the approximation error

on a smooth surface M, the (strong) Laplace–Beltrami operator ∆u of u is the unique continuous function that satisfies

Since the estimates hold for all triangles of Mh , we have verified (6).

3. Pointwise Approximation
The core of our approach to obtain pointwise approximation
estimates is to test the weak Laplace–Beltrami operator with
functions whose support gets more and more localized while
their L1 -norm remains constant and the growth of the W 1,1 norm is bounded. We define:
Definition 3 Let M be a smooth or a polyhedral surface in
R3 , and let CD be a positive constant. For any x ∈ M and
r ∈ R+ , we call a function ϕ : M → R r-local at x (with
respect to CD ) if the criteria

a smooth function on M. Then there exists a h0 ∈ R+ such

is closely inscribed to M and satisfies h < h0 and a function
ϕ that is r-local at a point y ∈ Mh , the estimate
h

|ϕ|W 1,1 ≤

for all f ∈ C2 (M), where C depends only on M. We give an
example of such a function in the appendix.

Proof The operator ∆h and the functions uh and ϕ are defined on Mh . First, we pullback ∆h , uh , and ϕ to M, add some
zeros, and use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to get

Functions satisfying properties (D2), (D3), and (D4) can
be used to approximate the function value at x of any continuous function f through the integral M f ϕ dvol. In this
sense, r-local functions are approximations of the delta distribution.
Lemma 4 Let ϕ ∈ L1 (M) satisfy properties (D2), (D3), and
(D4) of Definition 3 for some x ∈ M and r ∈ R+ , and let
f ∈ C1 (M). Then, the estimate

In the following, we derive bounds for each of the three summands of the right-hand side of (11). We start with the first
summand. Since the support of the function ϕ is contained
in the geodesic ball Br (y), the support of ϕˆ is contained in
the B A ∞ r (x). It follows from Lemma 1 that there is a constant C, which depends only on M and h0 , such that ϕˆ satisfies property (D3) for the point x and the radius Cr. Thus,
ˆ ϕˆ L1 satisfies the requirements of Lemma 4 and we get
ϕ/

For each ϕi there is a constant CD,i such that (D5) of Definition 3 is satisfied. In the following, we refer to the maximum
of the CD,i as the constant CD of {ϕi }.
Theorem 7 Let M be a smooth surface in R3 , and let u be
a smooth function on M. Then there exists a h0 ∈ R+ such
that for every pair consisting of a polyhedral surface Mh that
is closely inscribed to M and satisfies h < h0 and a set of
functions {ϕi }i∈{1,2,..n} such that every ϕi is r-local at the

satisfies (8) and r = h 3 , then we have

This bound is quadratic in h and therefore small compared to
the bound on the second summand. The combination of the
bounds on the three summands completes the proof.
The theorem is stated in a general setting that assumes no
correlation of r and h. The following corollary shows how to
choose r to get the optimal approximation order in h.

4. Discrete Laplace–Beltrami Operators
Based on the approximation results of the last section, we
construct discrete Laplace–Beltrami operators and prove
strong consistency. Then, we discuss matrix representations
of the operators and compare the consistency rates of our
approach and the mesh Laplacian.
Let n be the number of vertices of Mh and let
{v1 , v2 , ..., vn } denote the set of vertices. Any function uh ∈
Sh (Mh ) is uniquely determined by its function values at
the vertices. The vector (uh (v1 ), uh (v2 ), ..., uh (vn )) is called
the nodal vector, and we shall describe discrete Laplace–
Beltrami operators by their action on nodal vectors. Let
{ϕi }i∈{1,2,..n} be a set of functions such that every ϕi is
r-local at the vertex vi ∈ Mh . Then, we define the discrete
{ϕ }
Laplace–Beltrami operator ∆h i associated to {ϕi } as
{ϕi }

Matrix representation. We show how the cotan matrix can
{ϕ }
be used to construct the matrix representation L of ∆h i
with respect to the nodal basis. For simplicity, we assume
that the ϕi are functions in Sh . Let S denote the cotan matrix,
see [PP93], and let Φ be the matrix with entries Φi j = ϕi (v j ).
Then L is the sparse matrix given by
L = −Φ S.

(17)

The number of entries of L depends on the number of vertices that are in the support of the functions ϕi , hence on r.
When comparing our construction to the construction of
cotan Laplacians (as described in [WBG∗ 08]), we see that
Φ takes the role of the inverse mass matrix.
In general, the matrix Φ is not symmetric. But, Φ that are
symmetric can be constructed. The matrix can be decomposed into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part

Φ = Φsym + Φasym = (Φ + ΦT ) + (Φ − ΦT ),

where ΦT denotes the transpose of Φ. For certain choices of
r-local functions {ϕi }, the entries of Φasym are small compared to the entries of Φsym . For example, if we use the

instead of (17).
Comparison with the mesh Laplacian. Bounds on the consistency error of the mesh Laplacian depend on the mesh
size h, the maximum angle η (between normals of the
smooth and the polyhedral surface), and a parameter t, which
controls the width of the heat kernels. The parameter t is
the analog of the parameter r in our approach. Under the
assumption that the shape regularity of the polyhedral surface is bounded, η = O(h), which is optimal. Then, the consistency order depends on h and t. In [BSW09], the bound
1
O( th2 + t 2 ) on the consistency error of the mesh Laplacian

is derived. The optimal choice t = h yields a consistency

where H denotes the mean curvature of M. The Willmore
energy is connected to the Laplace–Beltrami operator by the
equation
H = HN = ∆I,

where I is the embedding of M and N is the surface normal
field. Hence, the Willmore energy of M equals the L2 -norm
of the ∆I. Let Ih : Mh → R3 denote embedding of the polyhedral surface Mh . Each of the three coordinates of Ih is a function in Sh . Therefore, we can define the discrete mean cur{ϕ }

We set r = h 3 and due to the approximate symmetry of ϕr

around x, we obtain an eoc of h 3 . The second function sets

r = h 2 , and we disturb the symmetry around x by translating
the center of the extrinsic

random vector of length h/20. The resulting function does

not satisfy (8), and we get the expected eoc of h 2 . We would
like to remark that in this experiment (and in many other

similar settings) we got an eoc of h if we set r = h 2 and
and do not translate the center of the function. This suggests
the question whether it is possible the improve the consis2

example, we consider polyhedral surfaces that approximate
the sphere, but the vertex positions are corrupted with random noise of order h2 . The lower part of Table 1 shows that

of type (20) at each vertex of the polyhedral surface. Table 2
shows the consistency error and the eoc.
7. Conclusion
We have shown that using the weak form of the Laplace–
Beltrami operator, one can construct discrete Laplace–
Beltrami operators that are strongly consistent. The approximation results are formulated for closely inscribed meshes
and therefore depend on the mesh size and the shape regularity. However, the results could be transferred to the more
general setting used in [HPW06] that does not restrict vertices to lay on the surface. We think that the presented
technique could be helpful for the construction of discrete
schemes, based on piecewise linear finite elements, for solving 4th order problems. As a step in this direction, we have
proposed a consistent discretization of the Willmore energy.

Appendix
In this appendix, we discuss a way to construct r-local functions. First, we consider a family of r-local functions on R2 ,
then we use the Riemannian exponential map to construct
a family of r-local functions on M. Let φ ∈ H 1 (R2 ) be a
non-negative function that vanishes in the complement of
the open unit ball in R2 and satisfies φ L1 (R2 ) = 1. For any
r ∈ R+ , φr defined by
φr (·) =

1 ·
φ( )
r2 r

is an r-local function on R2 and the constant CD
equals |φ|W 1,1 (R2 ) . Since the surface M is compact, the injectivity radius i(M) of M is a strictly positive number. For a
point x ∈ M and an r ∈ R+ , let Br (x) be the open geodesic
ball around x in M, and let Br (0) denote the open ball of
radius r around the origin 0 in Tx M. The Riemannian exponential map at x,
exp : Bi(M) (0) ⊂ Tx M → M,
is a diffeomorphism of Bi(M) (0) and exp(Bi(M) (0)) =
Bi(M) (x). Let ρ ∈ R+ be strictly smaller than i(M). Then,
for any r ∈ (0, ρ), ϕr given by
ϕr = φr ◦ exp−1

−1
−1
L1 (M) φr ◦ exp

is r-local at x. On polyhedral surfaces, we are not interested
1
in r-local functions for arbitrarily small r, but for r ∼ h 2 or
1
r ∼ h 3 . Furthermore, we restrict our attention to functions in
Sh . The interpolant in Sh of an r-local function ϕr on M is an
r-local function on Mh , though the values r may differ by h.
As an example of this construction of r-local functions,
let us consider the function φ(·) = π3 max{0, 1 − · R2 } on
R2 . We call the corresponding functions ϕr on M geodesic
hat functions, since they decay linearly with respect to the
geodesic distance to x. Explicitly, the functions are given by
ϕr = ϕ˜ r / ϕ˜ r L1 , where ϕ˜ r (y) = max{0, 1 − δM (x, y)/r} and
δM (x, y) denotes the geodesic distance of x and y. Due to
their symmetry around x, the functions ϕr are examples of
functions that satisfy the estimate (8). On Mh we can construct functions ϕr,h that approximate ϕr by replacing the
geodesic distance δM on M with the geodesic distance δMh
of Mh .
In our experiments, we use extrinsic hat functions instead of the geodesic hat functions, i.e. we replace the
geodesic distance by the Euclidean distance in R3 . For small
enough r, the extrinsic hat functions satisfy the properties
of r-local functions, except that we need to modify property (D3): the support of the extrinsic hat functions is not
contained in Br (x) but there is a constant C depending only
on M such that the support is contained in BCr (x). Still, our
estimates hold for these functions as well.
