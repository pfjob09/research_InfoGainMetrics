INTRODUCTION

The extraction of the corner points is useful for
computer applications such as image recognition,
segmentation, description, and data compression. Corner
points are used in various computer graphics, vision,
imaging and pattern recognition applications. It can be
used as a step in document image analysis, such as chart
and diagram processing and is also important from the
view point of understanding human perception of objects.
It plays crucial role in decomposing or describing the
curve. It is also used in scale space theory, image
representation, stereo vision, motion tracking, image
matching, building 2D mosaics, and preprocessing phase
of outline capturing systems.
Many corner detection algorithms have been proposed
in the literature [1,3,4,6,7,14,15]. Rosenfeld and Johnston
[6] took curvature maxima points using k-cosine as
corners. Rosenfeld and Weszka [7] proposed a
modification of [6] in which averaged k-cosines were
used. Freeman and Davis [4] found corners at maximum
curvature change in which a straight line segment moves
along the curve. Angular difference between successive
segments was used to measure local curvature. Beus and
Tiu [1] algorithm was similar to [4] except they proposed
arm cutoff parameter Ĳ to limit length of straight line.
Davies [3] has described a method for detecting corners
using Hough transform.
In this paper, we propose a new corner detection
algorithm. This algorithm is different from traditional
approaches [1,3,4,6-13] as it does not involve calculation
of cosine angle and curvature. Like [14,15], it incorporates
both local and global view of given shape. Set of three
ellipses represent three views of given shape. These
ellipses are moved along the shape boundary and contour
points in each ellipse at each step are counted. This
information (count of points in each ellipse) is used to
make final decision about the corner. A comparative study

PROPOSED ALGORITHM

Proposed technique of corner detection is based on
three sliding ellipses along the given curve. Information
about location of surrounding contour points is gathered in
its way. Three sliding ellipses with common center Ci are
given as:
R1
R2
R3

S u A u B,
½
°
S u 3 A / 4 u B, ¾
S u 3 A / 4 u B / 2.°¿

(1)

Their geometric structures are as follows:
x
x
x

The semi minor axis and semi major axis of the
ellipse R1 is considered to be the lengths A and B
respectively.
The semi minor axis and semi major axis of the
ellipse R 2 is considered to be the lengths 3A /4
and B respectively.
The semi minor axis and semi major axis of the
ellipse R3 is considered to be the lengths 3A /4
and B /2 respectively.

Ellipse R1 always lies along the slope of curve at
contour point Ci, 1  i  n where n is the total number of
contour points. Slope of contour at Ci is along the straight
line between two points, obtained by taking mean of five
points (including Ci) on both sides of Ci. Contour point Ci
automatically adjusts at the center when length and width
of R1 is L points and W points apart on both sides of ellipse
respectively. Similarly, ellipses R2 and R3 are drawn for Ci,
sharing same position of center. Thus R3  R2  R1 .
Set of ellipses is moved along the given curve/contour
and number neighboring points in each ellipse are counted
which can range from Ci-L to Ci+L. Let nR1,i, nR2,i and nR3,i
193

represent number of points in ellipse R1, R2 and R3
respectively, having ith contour point at centroid. For
example, one can set nR1,i = 21, nR2, i = 15 & nR3,i = 13.
Values of nR1, nR2 and nR3 for each contour point are
ultimately used while making final decision about the
corners.
Proposed algorithm combines the local and global
view of curve, following the natural corner detection
methodology. Set of three ellipses (described above) takes
three different views of contour points. Record of their
count (nR1,i, nR2,i and nR3,i), for each curve point, was
found to have enough information to locate proper corners.
Ellipse R1 takes broader picture of curve and passes only
those contour points for which no part of curve lies in area
(R1 – R2). Such curve points can be described as set G:

OR

G = {Ci : nR1,i = nR2,i}

(2)

Set G represents global view of image and does not
respond to fake corners (at curve irregularities) as
discussed above.
Set G does not consist of simple corners rather it gives
general area of curve around the corner. Figure 1 shows
some images marked with set G. Connected points in set G
form one group and number of groups may exist in set G.
Maximum of one corner point can exist in each group. In
each group, all points with nR3,i value below threshold “Ș”
are determined and the point with minimum nR3,i among
them is selected as a corner. Sometimes, none of the points
in a group with nR3,i below Ș exist which means corner
does not exist in that group. Corner for Figure 1, found
with this method, are marked by gray circles.

G = {Ci : nR1,i – nR2,i = 0}

Figure 1. Some shapes marked (bold) with contour points in set G. Corners are marked in gray.

Proposed corner detection algorithm is given in
Figure 2. In this algorithm, default value of A is 14.
A/8 and 3A/4 is assigned to B and Ș, respectively. All
other parameters (semi major axis and semi minor
axis of all ellipses) are relative to A. Value of
parameter A depends upon the size of boundary,
noise, resolution of image. Assigned values to semi
major axis and semi minor axis of all ellipses are
suitable to a certain range of size and resolution,
which covers all demonstrated shapes in this paper.
These sizes were found after extensive testing on
many images of similar size and resolution. The
relationship between relative size of ellipses is set
(again with extensive testing) for convenience of
using these parameters. The user needs to tune only
one parameter i.e. semi major axis instead of three.

However, accuracy can improve by assigning
independent sizes to these ellipses but this would be
at the cost of complex tuning of parameters.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

variations in curvature, corner sharpness and
noise/irregularities along the boundary curves. Such
variations are expected in original object boundaries.
These test shapes are used in this paper for
comparison/evaluation of different corner detectors.
Three popular algorithms, namely AS [14, 15], FD [4]
and BT [1], have been taken for comparison in our study.
The proposed algorithm is referred as SSZ.
A study of the four algorithms, in the light of the
criteria mentioned in Section 3, has been made. Figures
4-7 show the results of the four algorithms for the
proposed test shapes in Figure 1.
Overall accuracy of correctly detected corners in FD
algorithm was lowest (60%) for presented test shapes.
One can observe (in im3 and im4 of Figure 6) that FD
algorithm misses some important corner points.
Percentage of correct corner detection by BT
algorithm is higher (72%) than previous three algorithms
but it also tend to miss some important corners (in im4 of
Figure 10). Performance of this algorithm is better with
respect to localization error and incorrect detection
(10%).

Accuracy of any corner detector can be judged only if
the actual corner positions are already known. A panel of
10 human observers was used to judge the actual location
of corners for four test shapes. Corners marked by
majority were taken as actual corner positions which
were used in measuring corner detectors. Figure 3 shows
these test shapes marked with actual corner points.
Detected corners by proposed algorithm AS are
shown in Figure 4. One can see that the corner points,
detected by AS, have happened to be the same as
detected by human eyes. It is important to note that this
evaluation is all based on Accuracy, localization error,
noise sensitivity, transformation invariance, single
response, parameter setting, computation time.

COMPARATIVE STUDY

Variety of corner detectors have been proposed for
digital curves and their comparative study has also been
presented by some authors.
A corner detection algorithm must be tested on
variety of shapes for its proper evaluation. Four proposed
test shapes, in Figure 3, included most variety of

Percentage of correct corner detection by AS algorithm is
reasonable (98%) and is quite less as compared to the FD
and BT algorithms but it also tends to miss some important
corners (in im2 of Figure 4). Performance of this algorithm is
better with respect to localization error and incorrect
detection (6%).
Lowest percentage of incorrect detection (100%) is
another big advantage of the propose algorithm. One can
hardly find localization error at any detected corner points.
Performance of this algorithm must be appreciated in heavy
noise conditions as well as complex shapes. No algorithm
could accurately find all corners of im2, due to complex
shape of the figure, except proposed algorithm and that to
without any incorrect corner(s).

CONCLUSION

A new corner detection approach is proposed which does
not involve curvature analysis and hence making it very
efficient and accurate. A comparative study of different
algorithms, based on proposed parameters, is given.
Proposed algorithm has various advantages over previous
techniques which include consistency with human judgment
of corners; low ratio of false detection; efficiency; invariance
under
transformation
changes;
insensitivity
to
noise/irregularities along the curve; easy parameters
adjustment which are robust to minor changes in shape size
and resolution; and suitability to natural shapes/objects.
