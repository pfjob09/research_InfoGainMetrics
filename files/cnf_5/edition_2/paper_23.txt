Abstract—This article discusses the effects of Animated
Virtual Actors’ (AVAs) visual complexity on Simulator Sickness
(SS) in Virtual Reality (VR) applications. SS is one of the major
disadvantages of VR simulations. Previous research has shown
that visual complexity correlates with SS. Yet complex AVAs
are increasingly used along with real-time graphics. Minimising
SS for a VR application is thus beneficial. A series of VR
simulations were created to teach second-year psychology
students about the navigational capabilities of desert ants with
different levels of AVA’s visual complexity: flat, cartoon, or lifelike. We predicted that more complex AVAs would induce more
SS. The results contradicted the predictions, with no significant
differences in SS between groups as a function of the AVAs
visual complexity. Moreover, our methods succeeded in low
overall levels of SS in all the simulations. Possible explanations
and our future research directions are discussed.

a 3D North African saltpan to learn about the navigational
capabilities of Cataglyphis ants [8]. Depending on the group,
they learned with flat, cartoon, or life-like AVAs (Table I).
We used standardised the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire
[7, SSQ] to measure students level of SS. AVAs are not
limited to humans. The Cataglyphis ants provide complex
shapes and tripod-gait information, which is more complex
than a human-shaped AVA. This article defines an AVA’s
visual complexity1 as the amount of visual information or
elements in depicting an entity.
A. Simulator Sickness (SS)
Motion sickness is widely accepted as a form of sickness
according to the Sensory Rearrangement Theory as proposed by Reason and Brand [10] and Reason [11]. Sensory
Rearrangement Theory suggests that symptoms of motion
sickness occur when two or more sensory cues disagree, or
do not match with the expected experience. Motion sickness
often arises from visually-induced self-motion or vection
[12], [13]. The symptoms of motion sickness include vertigo,
dizziness, stomach discomfort and even vomiting [7]. The
effect of motion-sickness can be devastating, leading possibly to performance interruption and termination of task [14],
[15].
In VR applications, it is commonly called Cybersickness
or Simulator Sickness (SS). In VR, the reason for SS lies
in the sensory stimuli rather than sensory conflicts (e.g.,
[16], [17]) as originally proposed by Sensory Rearrangement
Theory. So et al. [12] argue that sensory conflicts cannot
be measured directly but sensory stimuli can be measured
readily. The new trend in the study of SS investigates various
sensory stimuli. The primary stimulus, which is the main
theme of VR applications, is the visual depiction of the
scene [12]. Most VR simulations involve the movement of
the virtual camera, while the user is mostly stationary. This
sense of visual self-motion contradicts vestibular stimuli and
triggers symptoms of SS. Various factors affect the degree

I. I NTRODUCTION
One of the main goals of in graphics technology and
Virtual Reality (VR), is the availability of tools to create lowcost [1], [2], or even free [3], [4] complex Animated Virtual
Actors (AVAs). This was nearly impossible for low-budget
industries in the early 1980, but is now readily available.
The applications of AVAs for learning in VR extend from
medical education [5] to Risk Assessment Training for
customs officers [6]. Despite the educational benefits of
VR, the designer must be concerned with the question:
”Will it make people sick?” One major disadvantage of
VR applications is that they can cause Cybersickness or
Simulator Sickness [7, SS]. The visual complexity of a VR
scene is known to induce SS. Therefore, the impact of an
AVA’s complexity on SS must be examined to be beneficial
for educational purposes.
In an attempt to minimise the effect of an AVA’s complexity on SS, this study employed a recently developed noninteractive VR learning material that was integrated into the
curriculum of second-year psychology students at Macquarie
University. This learning material took the students through

disorganisation, amount, heterogeneity, symmetries, colour variety, and
three-dimensionality of elements [9]

of visual stimulus in VR that contribute to SS, including
field of view [18], display size and movement [19], length
of exposure [20], [21], movement speed [22], and the visual
complexity of the scene [23], [22], [17], [12].

General discomfort, Fatigue, Headache, Eyestrain, Difficulty
focusing, Increased salivation, Sweating, Nausea, Difficulty
concentrating, Fullness of head, Blurred vision, Dizzy (eyes
open), Dizzy (eyes closed), Vertigo, Stomach awareness, and
Burping. Questions were summed to obtain three sub-scores
of SS: Nausea, Disorientation and Oculomotor, which can be
added for a total severity score [17]. The VR simulation was
run on an immersive semi-cylindrical (6m-wide) projection
system, which allowed a 160◦ field of view (FOV). The
VR simulation was designed to teach students about the
navigational capabilities of Cataglyphis ants on a featureless
saltpan [8]. The VR simulation was developed from actual
experiments and observations conducted by Wehner [8],
Zollikofer [25] and Wittlinger et al. [26]. It was organized
into five continuous scenes: 1 - introduction; 2 - overview
of path integration; 3 - skylight compass; 4 - step counting
behaviour; and 5 - summary. The length of the simulation
was 8 minutes and the camera moved slowly from one
location to another. The virtual actors were visible only in
scene 1, scene 2, scene 3, and scene 5. We used Blender
[3] for 3D modelling, and animation; Vue [27], GIMP [28]
and Inkscape [29] for texturing the virtual world. The VR
simulation ran smoothly at maximum frame-rate. The virtual
scene was projected onto the semi-cylindrical screen by
using Vizard [30] at 3027 x 1024 pixels resolution. The
scene was composed of AVAs, plain sand throughout, a clear
blue sky, simulated polarisation patterns in the sky, food
items and three test-channels. Throughout the experiment,
the scenario, the scene, screen resolution, screen colour,
camera’s movement and the narration were the same. The
only independent variable is the type of AVA, which was
altered for each group. None of the students had attended the
simulation before. Since there was no interactivity within the
VR simulation, everyone received an equal visual exposure.
Table I summarises the different viewing conditions with
three types of AVA and Figure 1 shows the AVAs on the
semi-cylindrical canvas in our VR Lab. The life-like AVA
was the complex AVA. It was modelled and animated after
the real Cataglyphis ant. The cartoon AVA was a simplified
model of life-like AVA and composed of fewer polygons,
joints and simpler animations. The flat AVA was modelled
after an extreme simplification of a Cataglyphis ant. The flat
AVA did not have any 3D shape, only a 2D plane with no
animated joints, and it took less than 2 minutes to create it.

B. AVA’s Level of Visual Complexity
How does an AVA’s level of complexity affect SS?
Commonly in VR applications, the camera is fixed on the
stationary AVA (e.g., [5], [6]). In science learning, however,
the camera must often follow on AVA to observe a particular
behaviour. Nowadays, creating even more complex AVAs
is not difficult with the availability of 3D modelling and
painting tools, along with faster computers and graphic cards
[6], [24].
Studies indicate that the complexity of visual stimuli in
a scene, arising from scenes with many elements, increases
SS [23], [22], [17], [12]. Kavakli et al. [17] showed that
a complex scene with objects, which contain extraneous
details, such as windows, doors, cracks, and signs of surface
imperfections, induces more SS than a simple black and
white scene. In an attempt to quantify visual complexity, So
et al. [12] showed that complex scenes with detailed textures
and additional objects increase SS rating. Similarly, Mourant
and Thattacherry [23] and Mourant et al. [22] showed that
adding details such as urban buildings in the scene increases
SS. The increase of SS is expected because higher complexity increases the amount of optic flow, creating stronger
vection [22]. In light of these studies, our initial hypothesis
is that the AVA’s visual complexity will also increase overall
complexity of the scene, which in turn increases vection and
produces stronger SS. The simulation, which was created for
Psychology students, contains three different types of AVAs
(Table I). We predicted that the SS ratings will follow the
order of AVA complexity.
II. M ETHODS
A. Participant and Design
The participants were 200 second year psychology students at Macquarie University (59 males and 141 females)
with median age of 20.55 (IQR = 20 - 22). No extra credit
was given as the session was part of the course. A prac
group of 4 to 25 students participated in the experiment in
the VR lab at the same time. Each prac group as a whole
was randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions differing in
the AVA’s complexity (Table I), 60 participants leant with
flat AVAs, 63 participants learnt with cartoon AVAs, and 77
participants learnt with life-like AVAs.

C. Procedure
Upon the arrival in the VR lab, a group of students was
asked to fill in the consent form and randomly assigned
to one of three AVA conditions. The students were then
reminded about SS and the procedure to follow if they feel
sick in the simulation. SSQ values were collected before
and after viewing the simulation. Finally, once the students
completed the questionnaires, they were thanked for the
participation.

B. Material and Apparatus
The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire [7, SSQ] was employed to assess the degree of severity in the simulation.
The SSQ was administered before and after the exposure
to the VR presentation. The SSQ required the participants
to give a scale from 0 to 3 on each of 16 symptoms listed:

Initial assessment using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test
and the Levene test for unequal variances found violations
for assumptions needed for parametric statistical tests. Nonparametric tests were thus used in this study. Cliff’s d values
were calculated to indicate the effect size [31], [32], [33]. All
statistical analysis methods were performed by using R [34].
Table II shows the medians (Mdn) and the interquartile range
(IQR) of three sub-dependent measures and the total SSQ
score for each group: nausea, disorientation, oculomotor and
total severity score.
Does the increase of SS follow the order of AVA’s
visual complexity? To answer this question, a KruskalWallis nonparametric ANOVA test was performed with
AVA’s visual complexity as the factor, and the difference
in total SS severity scores (post-exposure score minus preexposure score), as the dependent variable. The test did
not reveal any significant differences between the groups,
χ2 (2, N = 200) = 0.55, p = 0.76. The results did not
support the proposed prediction and showed no differences
between flat, cartoon and life-like AVA in causing SS.

V ISUAL C OMPLEXITY OF AVA S

Figure 1.

On the negative side, VR is known for inducing SS and
one of the main factors of SS is the visual complexity
of the scene. Previous studies indicate that the complexity
of a scene in VR applications induce SS, which detracts
from the advantages of the latest technology in creating
complex AVAs. Three different types of AVAs were made
available for the latest VR learning experience at Macquarie
University. The simulation taught students the navigational
capabilities of Cataglyphis ants. The study investigated the
effects of visual complexity of AVAs in causing SS.
In contrast to the previous studies [23], [12], [22], [17],
our findings do not indicate any increase in SS with increasing AVA visual complexity. If anything, subjects reported
less SS after viewing the animated scene. We can think
of several explanations for our results. Firstly, the results
from previous studies in visual complexity and SS are based
on the visual complexity of the virtual environment itself.
Kavakli et al. [17] added visual details in the buildings, So
et al. [12] added detailed textures and objects, and Mourant
et al. [23], [22] added urban buildings in a driving simulator,
and all showed that scene complexity led to higher SS. These
virtual environments had complex backgrounds that stood
still and did not move along with the camera. In our experiment, however, the AVAs portrayed in the simulation served
as both foreground and background objects. Secondly, the
speed and the path of the virtual camera were slower and
different from the previous studies of SS in VR simulations.
We deliberately slowed the camera movements in an attempt
to minimise possible SS in the students. This factor deserves
to be further tested. Thirdly, the amount of visual complexity
of our AVAs might not be sufficient to induce SS. The
AVA’s complexity in this study is small in comparison to
the visual complexity of AVAs in Kavakli et al.s study [17].
A fourth possible explanation is that the AVAs do not appear
in every scene, and they were sometimes very small because
the camera was far away.

AVAs as Projected on Canvas

Furthermore, this study discovered gender effects of SS.
The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed, using gender
as the factor, and the differences between post and pre
total severity scores as the dependent variable. The analysis
revealed that female participants felt less SS after viewing
the VR simulation than male participants, W = 3262.5,
p = 0.02, d = 0.22. There was also a significant gender
difference in the SSQ sub-score: oculomotor, W = 3395,
p = 0.04, d = −0.18. However, there was no significant
gender difference in disorientation, W = 3558.8, p = 0.09,
d = −0.14, or Nausea, W = 3688.5, p = 0.19, d = −0.11.

V. C ONCLUSION
In sum, this study assessed the impact of the AVA’s visual
complexity on simulator sickness. Results showed that the
visual complexity of AVAs did not affect SS, and that the
VR simulation on the whole produced very little SS. We
have made a safe VR presentation for future educational
use. The results also have important implications for artists
and designers. If the AVA’s complexity does not affect SS,
artists and designers can unleash their creativity by using
affordable and readily available modelling packages, such
as; Quidam [2], Daz3D [1], Makehuman [4] and Blender [3],
in creating visually complex AVAs, as long as measures are
taken, as we have done, to minimise overall SS. To confirm
the findings of this study, another simulation is underway to
train fire-fighters in VR.

IV. D ISCUSSION
Recent technologies in computer graphics enable artists
and designers to create complex Animated Virtual Actors
(AVAs). The availability of the technology enables institutions to create AVAs for education and research purposes.
