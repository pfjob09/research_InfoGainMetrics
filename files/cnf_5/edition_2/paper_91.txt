Abstract

1. Introduction

Wind carried the smoke further afield from forest fires
in Sumatra caused worse air pollution in Malaysia reached
extremely hazardous levels and forced schools and an
airport to close. There were 3,258 'hot spots' recorded by
NOAA satellites in the province of Riau only in August,
each one representing a fire. USM Pulau Pinang station
results and data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder
(AIRS) indicate that an air mass originating from July to
September over forest fires in Riau and North Sumatra
arrived in Malaysia. AIRS with its two companion
microwave instruments, (AMSU) and (HSB), form the
integrated atmospheric sounding system. Provides
information for several greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4, CO
and O3 as well as to improve weather prediction and study
the water and energy cycle. AIRS measure CO total
column by (52)channels with Uncertainty Estimate 15-20%
at 500mb.The Retrieved CO total column amount
(CO_total_column_A) as well as Effective CO volume
mixing ratio (CO_VMR_eff_A), Level-3 monthly
(AIR*3STM) 1º*1º spatial resolution and Effective CO
Volume Mixing Ratio profile (CO_VMR_eff) (9 layers)
ascending, Level-2 daily Standard are used to study the
CO distribution & the impact of Indonesia forest fire, the
map & data was processed and analyzed by using
Photoshop & SigmaPlot 11.0 programs and compared for
two timing of various, (day time) summer (July, August &
September) 2005 & 2007.Note the variations in the
biomass burning and CO emissions over study area, while
highest CO occurs over Industrial and congested urban
zones and a greater draw down of CO occurs over Perak.
Carbon monoxide concentration on August 2005 higher
than August 2007 in all cases, and agree very well on the
horizontal distributions of CO represented by the high
correlation coefficients (0.8472 - 0.8929).The CO maps
were generated using Kriging Interpolation technique.

Carbon monoxide has an indirect radiative forcing effect
by increasing concentrations of tropospheric ozone and
methane through chemical reactions with other
atmospheric constituents, because it has influence on
oxidization in the atmosphere by interaction with hydroxyl
radicals (OH), halocarbons, tropospheric. It accountable
for 75% of hydroxyl radicals (OH) sinks (Thompson,
1992), it will influence the concentration of greenhouse
gases and the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere and
contributes to climate change (Daniel and Solomon, 1998).
Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen cyanide,
ammonia and more than 4000 chemical compounds are
created when a cigarette burns; all are present in cigarette
smoke. The primary source of CO is incomplete
combustion of fossil fuels used for heating and
transportation, refuse and agricultural burning, natural
forest fires, and by-products from some industrial sources.
During World War II, where gasoline was scarce, carbon
monoxide used to keep motor vehicles running in parts of
the world. Because of it weak absorption of infrared
radiation from the Earth so Carbon monoxide (CO) is not a
significant greenhouse gas. CO plays a highly useful role
in modern technology, has many applications in bulk
chemicals manufacturing, which is often used for industrial
power and in industrial scale operations for purifying
Nickel (Wenham, 2006). During the past two decades,
trace gas abundances in the troposphere were obtained
from sparsely distributed measurement sites, and
observations were mostly confined to the surface
(C.Clerbaux et al., 2003).The first satellite observations of
Carbone monoxide came from the measurement of
atmosphere pollution from satellite (MAPS) instrument
onboard the space Shuttle (Connors et al., 1999).
The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder is one of six
instruments on board the Aqua satellite, onboard the Earth
Observing System (EOS) Aqua spacecraft launched May 4,
2002, form with its partner, Advanced Microwave
Sounding Unit (AMSU-A), represents the most advanced
atmospheric sounding system ever deployed in space. The
term "sounder" in the instrument's name refers to the fact
that water vapor and temperature are measured as functions
of height. AIRS measure CO total column by (36)channels
with Uncertainty Estimate 15-20% at 500mb, Vertical

Indonesia forest fires 2005 affected 10,000 hectares of
peat forest in Sumatra between Riau and North Sumatra,
smoke from forest fires were badly affected and caused
serious air pollution in Malaysia, northern Sumatra and
Singapore, as the wind carried the smoke further afield
from July to September 2005. In Malaysia, air pollution
reached extremely hazardous levels and forced schools and
an airport to close. NOAA recorded 5420 hotspots from
satellite images over the area of fire between mid-July and
mid-August (Down to Earth, 2005). Observed an elevation
in the CO measurements higher than the normal rates from
ILP, Perai, P. Pinang station during the period from midJune to mid- August 2005. The highest value on 13 August
(1.972 ppm) values recorded by surface monitors across
the Penang area was the highest of any August day during
the 1996–2007 periods.
This study is based on CO retrievals from a research
version of the current AIRS operational physical algorithm,
used Standard Level-2 (AIRX2RET)and Level-3 Monthly
Product (AIRX3STM) Version 5 data, can be obtained
from the website: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/data_access.shtml,
to study Atmospheric Carbon monoxide distribution over
Peninsular Malaysia for the period from August to
September 2005 . The Retrieved CO total column amount
as well as Effective CO volume mixing ratio (ratio of
number of CO molecules to the number of molecules of air
in a unit volume), from Level-3 Monthly (ascending) are
compared, between the two timing of various (August
2005 & 2007), and Effective CO volume mixing ratio
(Level-3), between the two timing of various August to
September (2005&2007) to assess the effect of Indonesia
forest fire August 2005 on atmosphere CO distribution. We
extend the results by comparing Retrieved CO volume
mixing ratio (9 layers) with Height from Level-2, for
timing of various (day time) (28 August 2005 & 29 August
2007) to evaluate CO distribution in the troposphere and
stratosphere as well as comparison the measurements of
layers near the surface with ground station results, the land
use map of the Peninsular Malaysia was conducted, map
was processed and analyzed by using Photoshop CS &
SigmaPlot 11.0 software. We attempt to optimize the AIRS
CO retrieval algorithm to test the accuracy of results and
their impacts on temperature based on the highest
correlation coefficient, R2 and lowest root mean square
error, RMS for CO total column amount and CO volume
mixing ratio, the study provided useful information for

3. Acquisition and specification
The AIRS and AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding
Unit) observe the entire atmospheric column from Earth's
surface to the top of the atmosphere. AIRS provides
spectral coverage at 2378 channels in the 3.74-4.61 μm,
6.20-8.22 μm and 8.8-15.4 μm infrared wavebands at a
nominal spectral resolution λ⁄∆λ ranging from 1086 to
1570, also includs four visible/near-IR (Vis/NIR) channels
between 0.40 and 0.94 μm, with a 2.3-km FOV (W.
Wallace McMillana et al., 2008). The Science Objectives
of AIRS is to determination of the factors that control the
global energy and water cycles, investigation of
atmosphere-surface interactions, improving numerical
weather prediction, assessing climate variations and
feedbacks and detection of the effects of increased carbon

September) (top) and 2005 summer (July, August and
September) (bottom). The combination of rich local
sources of CO in peninsular Malaysia along with the
transport of additional CO, and Carbon monoxide from
remote forest fires in Indonesia led to the Carbon
monoxide pollution event of August that was characterized
increases in Carbon monoxide by 10-15% and for
September 10-20% over most area, while higher values in
central region (Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding areas
like Selangor). For summer 2007, where normal
circumstances in the absence of any event, can observed
the highest value of CO total column over Industrial and
congested urban zones, was for September in Kuala
Lumpur Parties (0.61809 ppm) at latitude 3.5º, and a
greater draw down of CO occurs over the pristine marine
environment, Terengganu on July (0.5752ppm) at latitude
4.5º, while for summer 2005, we note the clear impact of
Indonesia forest fire on CO rate concentration especially in
the months of August & September, higher values also
appear over the East of Kuala Lumpur in
September(0.6547ppm) at latitude 3.5º and the less value
was in July(0.5765ppm) over the west coast in the Perak at
latitude 4.5º.

4. Data Analysis and Results
The skies over Peninsular Malaysia were noticeably
hazier than normal on mid-August 2005. In this paper, we
examine the impact of one smoke transport event on
Carbon monoxide levels over Peninsular Malaysia, the
elevated levels of Carbon monoxide found in smoke
plumes from incomplete combustion of forest fires can
lead to significant further CO production downwind of the
fires, links between forest fires and pollution observations
downwind are well established. To better assess the impact
of the transported smoke filled air mass on the local air
quality in peninsular Malaysia we examined the data from
AIRS for two timing of various (day time) ,summer (July,
August & September) 2005 & 2007. The Retrieved total

boundary layer containing industrial & biomass emissions
from forest fire (28 August 2005). For the clean case, note
how most of the Volume Mixing Ratio have similar shapes
and peak for all layers near top and mid of troposphere, CO
concentration in the eight layers (0.75-47.8 km) has highest
value over southern regions, while in the close last layer
from the land surface vary, for different regions, the
highest CO value over Industrial and congested urban
zones. The comparisons between [a] and [b] for all layers
show apparent biases with [b] higher than [a], relatively
mini difference in Stratosphere and top of Troposphere. In
the layer below 500 millibar (6 km) about half of the Earth
s atmosphere's mass are lies. Many weather systems tend to
follow the wind flow at this level, this level is often
considered to denote the steering guide level of these
systems. Industrial burning, forest fires and agricultural
can create large amounts of carbon monoxide, at the
troposphere middle (6 km) differences are range (5-10%)
the highest over northern regions, while the altitudes (43.7,
31.1, 14.7, 0.75 km) the differences are range (8-20%) but
the highest over central regions at latitude 3º and 4º. also
when approaching the surface of the earth we found clear
discrepancy and different between the values of CO
concentration from north to south in 2005 while less
difference in 2007, in both cases, the highest
concentrations for various layers at latitude 3º-3º.5′ , where
the populous cities and industrial zones in the peninsular
Malaysia.
Observed an elevation in the CO measurements higher
than the normal rates from ILP, Perai, P. Pinang station
during the period from mid-June to mid- August 2005,
where the values of July (0.675ppm), August (o.602ppm)
and September (0.499pmm), the highest value was on 13
August (1.972 ppm). For 2007, the results of the station
shows moderate and natural CO concentration for July
(0.518ppm), August (0.358ppm) and September
(0.417ppm), with the relative decline for the month of
August on average annual. Of the above results show the
significant large and clear impact of Indonesia forest fire
on CO concentration for August 2005, whereas, the value
on 13 August recorded by surface monitors across the
Penang area was the highest of any August day during the
1996-2007 periods.
The Retrieved total column CO and Effective CO
volume mixing are well correlated by using (PolynomialCubic) algorithm for both timing of various, are very well
correlated with (R=0.8929 & RMS=0.7974) for August
2007 and (R=0.8472 & RMS=0.7178) for August 2005,
these high correlation coefficients indicate that AIRS data
are able to capture the features Atmospheric Carbon
Monoxide distribution over Peninsular Malaysia with a
good agreement.

differences are larger in a range of (~0.5 - 3e+17
molecules/cm²) over peninsular Malaysia when the total
column CO amount are very low (1.59e+18
molecules/cm²) for August 2007.However, CO total
column in August 2005 higher than August 2007 over most
of areas especially on the northern region {red colors
(3e+17 molecules/cm²) at latitude 4.5º} when the total
column CO amount is relatively high.
The highest value of CO VMR for August 2007 was also
over Industrial and congested urban zones, over Selangor
{at latitude 3.5º (0.6065ppm) green pixels} and the less
value was over Perak {at latitude 5.5º (0.5912ppm) violet
pixels}, while for August 2005, we note the clear impact of
Indonesia forest fire on CO VMR especially in the central
regions where the highest value over Selangor {at latitude
3.5º (0.6471ppm) red color } and the less value was in the
southern region over Johor {at latitude 1.5º (0.6072ppm)
green color }. The August 2005 - August 2007 CO
Volume Mixing Ratio differences are larger in a range of
(~0.01 - 0.05 ppm) over peninsular Malaysia when the CO
VMR amount are very low (0.5711ppm) for August 2007.
Also CO VMR in August 2005 higher than in August 2007
over northern regions and central regions (orange colors).
We can deduce from Figures 2&3, for summer 2007,
where normal circumstances in the absence of any event,
the higher value of CO concentrations over Industrial and
congested urban zones (it's the most abundant pollutant in
urban atmosphere and very stable, having an average
lifetime of 2-4 months), usually in the center of Peninsular
Malaysia at latitude 3.5º, where high proportion CO
production, while the lower value of CO over clean regions
in the north, upper the latitude 5º, especially near the
northwest coasts of Peninsular Malaysia, because of lack
sources of CO as well as active monsoon in those areas
which removes polluting gases continuously (CO slighter
lighter than air). As for August 2005, both CO VMR and
CO total column, large and clear impact of Indonesia forest
fire making process was the reverse, where a high CO
occur precisely in a region that experienced extensive to
the fire regions, which extends from Riau to north Sumatra
in Indonesia and are usually close to the northern areas of
peninsular Malaysia. In addition to the impact of Indonesia
forest fire we found that higher CO concentration still over
Industrial and congested urban zones especially over
central regions and Perak region is cleanest areas and less
CO concentrations during most times of year.
The (CO_VMR_eff) Effective CO Volume Mixing Ratio
profile (9 layers) ascending, Level-2 Standard with
Footprints 30 (cross-track) in each of 45 scanset (alongtrack), also used to study atmospheric CO distribution in 9

Conclusions
at altitudes (43.7, 31.1, 14.7, 0.75 km) the differences are
range (8-20%) and the highest over central regions at
latitude 3.5º and 4.5º. Whereas, the value on 13 August
was the highest of any August day during the 1996-2007
periods, harmonization with ILP, Perai, P. Pinang station
results. Also the impact of fire was very clear on CO
concentration in the troposphere and Perak region is
cleaner areas and less CO concentrations in most times of
the year. In summary, when the same a priori information
is used, both Events agree very well on horizontal
distributions CO represented by the high correlation
coefficients (0.8472 - 0.8929). This study showed that
Satellite measurements distinguish and able to measure the
increase of atmospheric carbon monoxide concentration
over peninsular Malaysia. Further study will be extended
to assess the observation and measurement of the satellite
(AIRS) to other pollutant & greenhouses gases.

This paper has provided evidence for the impact of
remote forest fires burning on carbon monoxide pollution
levels above peninsular Malaysia, during summer 2005.
Forest fires burning in Indonesia during august produced a
cloud of smoke containing elevated levels of CO. For
normal circumstances, in the absence of any event at
summer 2007, the higher CO concentrations over the
populous cities and industrial zones, the highest values
were at latitude 3.5º in the middle of peninsular Malaysia,
during (CO_total_column_A) & (CO_VMR_eff_A)
comparison for both timing of various, the larger
difference was in the northern region at a latitude 4.5º ,
because of the significant large and clear impact of
Indonesia forest fire on CO concentration at August 2005,
and smaller in the southern region. Also the impact of fire
was very clear on CO concentration in the mid-troposphere
