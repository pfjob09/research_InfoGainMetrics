Abstract

Keywords--- ALOS, TSS.

Remote sensing technique is very effective method for water
quality mapping through analysis of satellite images over a
large coverage of study area. The objective of this study
was to test the feasibility of using the ALOS digital image
for Total Suspended Solids (TSS) mapping over Penang
Island, Malaysia. A new algorithm was developed for
detecting and mapping water pollution from the ALOS
satellite image. The algorithm used was based on the
reflectance model, which is a function of the inherent
optical properties of water, and these in turn can be related
to the concentration of the pollutants. Water samples were
collected using a small boat simultaneously with the
acquisition of the satellite image and later analyzed in the
laboratory to determine the real concentration of the TSS
level. Water sampleâ€™s locations were determined by using a
handheld GPS. A simple atmospheric correction, namely
darkest pixel technique was performed in this study. This is
a very simple correction, based on 2 assumption: The first
assumption is that in the darkest water pixel of the image
there is total light absorption and the radiation light
recorded by this pixel comes from the atmospheric path
radiance and secondly it is assumed that the atmospheric
path radiance is uniform all over the image. The radiation
of the darkest water pixel (assumed to represent the
atmosphere) is subtracted from the whole image. The
darkest pixel is found by searching for the lowest values
over water for all wavelengths. The digital numbers for
each band corresponding to the sea-truth locations were
extracted and then converted into radiance values and
reflectance values. The reflectance values were used for
calibration of the water quality algorithm. The calibrated
TSS algorithm was then used to generate the water quality
maps of the study areas. The newly developed algorithm can
estimate TSS concentration with linear correlation
coefficient square (R) of 0.92. The result obtained indicated
that reliable estimates of TSS values for the Penang Island,
Malaysia, could be retrieved using this technique.

1. Introduction
Suspended matter deposited in reservoirs reduces their
storage capacity and suspended material reduces the light
penetration in water thus minimising the fish production
[1]. Suspended sediments causes problems in water bodies
and to some extent indicates pollution and erosion in an
area. The major factors affecting surface water quality are
suspended sediments, chlorophyll, nutrients and pesticides.
Although accurate measurements of water quality
parameters can be obtained with a conventional measuring
technique, such a survey is time consuming and expensive
and the measured samples unable to represent the detail
distribution patterns [2, 3]. The standard traditional
mapping and monitoring techniques have already become
too expensive compared to the information achieved for
environmental use. A solution could be to optimize our
efforts and more frequently base our surveillance on
remote sensing techniques to improve the information
content and limit the cost [4]. Remote sensing data have
been widely used in environmental studies like land cover
change, flood observation, environmental pollution
monitoring. Remote sensing offers potentially a significant
source of information and methods are being developed for
operational large-scale monitoring of water quality [5].
Water quality assessment of ocean and inland waters using
satellite data has been carried out since the first remote
sensing satellite Landsat-MSS has been operational [6].
Satellite imagery has been widely used for water quality
studies in coastal regions and in inland lakes [7, 8, 9, 10].
The sediment, backscattering and the absorption
characteristics can be related to its concentration although
other factors such as the sediment's size and colour are also
important in this study. Hence, an algorithm can be
developed from the optical model water. The TSS map was
developed using the proposed algorithm. In addition, the
503

3. Optical model of water

TSS map was also geometrically corrected and colourcoded for visual interpretation. Remote sensing imagery
can provide a synoptic view of the study area that can be
related to the collected water samples based on the
proposed water quality algorithm.
In this work, the algorithms developed for use in
remote sensing applications were tested with the satellite
digital images. The objective of this study is to investigate
the newly developed algorithm for Total Suspended Solids
(TSS) mapping by using high resolution ALOS imagery.
Determination of water quality parameters using regression
algorithm technique has been adopted by many workers
[11, 12, 13].

A new algorithm was developed for detecting and
mapping water pollution from the digital camera images.
The algorithm used was based on the reflectance model
which is a function of the inherent optical properties of
water and this in turn can be related to the concentration of
its constituents.
A physical model relating radiance from the water
column to the concentrations of the waterâ€™s constituents
provides the most effective way to analyze remotely sensed
data for water quality studies. Remote sensing reflectance,
R, is related to the irradiance reflectance just beneath the
water surface, Rird [13] and is calculated as:

The study area is the Penang Island, Malaysia, located
within latitudes 5o 12â€™ N to 5o 30â€™ N and longitudes 100o
09â€™ E to 100o 26â€™ E. The map of the region is shown in
Figure 1. The satellite image was acquired on 24 April 2007
captured by satellite ALOS â€“ AVNIR-2. The satellite data
was in 1B2 product level. Water samples were collected
simultaneously with the satellite images acquisition from a
small boat. The sampling locations were determined using a
handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). Water samples
were analysed in the laboratory to determine the TSS by
using the standard method as suggested by other researcher
[14].

For estuaries water, backscatter is much less

The inherent optical properties are determined by the
contents of the water. The contributions of the individual
components to the overall properties are strictly additive
[19].

expressed as [19]

We have to know two parameters (the backscattering

these parameters were not available from this study area.
So we used regression technique to solve the equation.
From Equation 10, we can simplify the regression model as
shown by Equation 11 for TSS.

The absorption of pure seawater is practically the same
as the pure water in the visible region (400-700nm).
Absorption by dissolved salts is known to be negligible in
this region [19]. The absorption related to each substance is
expressed as the product of its concentration, P (nonchlorophyllous particles) and its corresponding specific
absorption coefficients ap*(O).
Therefore the total absorption

The Japanese Earth observing satellite program
consists of two series: those satellites used mainly for
atmospheric and marine observation, and those used
mainly for land observation. The Advanced Land
Observing Satellite (ALOS) follows the Japanese Earth
Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) and Advanced Earth
Observing Satellite (ADEOS) and will utilize advanced
land-observing technology. ALOS will be used for
cartography, regional observation, disaster monitoring, and
resource surveying.

to survey natural resources (Resources Surveying),
to develop technology necessary for future Earth observing
satellite (Technology Development)
An ALOS AVNIR-2 satellite scene of the study area
captured on 24 April 2007 was used in the present
investigation. The Advanced Visible and Near Infrared
Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) is a visible and near
infrared radiometer for observing land and coastal zones.
AVNIR-2 is a successor to AVNIR that was on board the
Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), which was
launched in August 1996. Its instantaneous field-of-view
(IFOV) is the main improvement over AVNIR. AVNIR-2
also provides 10m spatial resolution images, an
improvement over the 16m resolution of AVNIR in the
multi-spectral region. Improved CCD detectors (AVNIR
has 5,000 pixels per CCD; AVNIR-2 7,000 pixels per
CCD) and electronics enable this higher resolution. A
cross-track pointing function for prompt observation of
disaster areas is another improvement. The pointing angle
of AVNIR-2 is +44 and - 44 degree. Table 2 shows the
sensor characteristics for ALOS AVNIR-2 scene. Figure 4
show the raw ALOS AVNIR-2 satellite scene.

capability. They will be essential to high-resolution remote
sensing satellites in the next decade. ALOS have been
successfully launched on an H-IIA launch vehicle from the
Tanegashima Space Center, Japan.
The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) was
launched on Jan 24th, 2006 onboard a JAXA H-IIA
launcher. The planned operational lifetime is 3 years, in a
near-polar, Sun-synchronous orbit, at a mean altitude of
691 km. Its payload consists of three sensors: Advanced
Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2),
Panchromatic Remote sensing Instrument for Stereo
Mapping (PRISM), Phased Array type L-band Synthetic
Aperture Radar (PALSAR). The coverage and distribution
of ALOS data is done through the implantation of the
ALOS Data Node concept. The acquisitions performed
globally are classified in four regions: Asia, Europe and
Africa, America, Australia and Oceania.

ALOS is one of the largest Earth observing satellites ever
developed. Its objectives are:
to provide maps for Japan and other countries including
those in the Asian-Pacific region (Cartography)
to perform regional observation for "sustainable

and development (Regional Observation),

the spectral radiance, as calculated above, was converting
to a sensor reflectance values (Equations 12 and 13).
The AVNIR-2 products are processed into CEOS
format, and external ASCII file (â€˜summary.txtâ€™) is
embedded within the product. The rescaling gain and offset
are not directly written into â€˜summary fileâ€™ but only into
scene header record. The rescaling gain and offset is
changing along with time and geographical position.
The DN values were converted into irradiance values
and then converted into reflectance values. First, radiance
was calculated from DN by:

data set, the R and RMS values were 0.9234 and 8.547
mg/l respectively. Map of the water quality parameter was
then generated using the calibrated proposed algorithm.
The generated map was filtered using 3 by 3 pixels average
to remove random noise and then colour-coded for visual
interpretation. The concentrations are displayed in
increments of 50 mg/l interval which are appropriate given
the RMS error of the computed values. The lowest
concentration interval in the range is < 100 mg/l because
the algorithm did not detect TSS < 50 mg/l. The maps were
colour-coded for visual interpretation (Figure 5).

All image-processing tasks were carried out using PCI
Geomatica version 10.1 digital image processing software
at the School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).
A simple atmospheric correction of darkest pixel technique
was performed in this study. This is a very simple
correction, based on 2 assumptions:
â€¢ The first assumption is that in the darkest water pixel of
the image there is total light absorption i.e. this pixel
represents black water and the light recorded for this pixel
is equal to the atmospheric path radiance.
â€¢ Secondly it is assumed that the atmospheric path radiance
is uniform all over the image. The spectrum of the darkest
water pixel (assumed to represent the atmosphere) is
subtracted from the whole image. The darkest pixel is
found by searching for the lowest values over water for all
wavelengths. The pixel with the lowest value in most of the
bands was selected as the darkest pixel.
The satellite image was then geometrically corrected
by second order polynomial equation using the nearest
neighbor method. Image rectification was performed by
using a second order polynomial tranformation equation.
The digital number (DN) for each band corresponding to
the sea-truth locations was extracted from the geocoded
image. To reduce data noise average DN values were
calculated. For each scene, sets of data were extracted by
using different window sizes and those data sets were then
tested with our model. The window size (array) that
resulted in the highest accuracy was selected as the average
filter for that scene. In this study, The DN values were
extracted using window sizes of 3 by 3 pixels because the
data produced higher correlation coefficient.
And then the digital numbers for each band
corresponding to the sea-truth locations were extracted and
then converted into radiance values and reflectance values.
The extracted reflectance values were regressed with their
respective sea-truth data and the proposed algorithm to
obtain the regression coefficients. In this study, the
reflectance values derived from ALOS AVIR-2 signals
were used as independent variables in our calibration
regression analyses for TSS. The proposed algorithm
produced higher correlation coefficient between the
predicted and the measured TSS values and lower RMS

6. Conclusion
A high correlation coefficient was obtained with the
proposed algorithm for TSS mapping over Penang Island,
Malaysia by using ALOS imagery. The proposed algorithm
is considered superior to other tested algorithms based on
the values of the correlation coefficient, R=0.9234 and
root-mean-square error, RMS=8.547 mg/l.This study
indicates the usefulness of ALOS â€“ AVNIR-2 for TSS
mapping.
