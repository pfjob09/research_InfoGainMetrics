Abstract
In this paper, a newly constructed rational quadratic
trigonometric Bézier curve with two shape parameters is
presented. The purposed curve enjoys all the geometric
properties of the traditional rational quadratic Bézier
curve. The local control on the shape of the curve can be
attained by altering the values of the shape parameters
as well as the weight. The curve exactly represents some
quadratic trigonometric curves such as the arc of an
ellipse and the arc of a circle and best approximates the
ordinary rational quadratic Bézier curve.
Keywords: Trigonometric polynomials, Quadratic
trigonometric basis functions, Rational quadratic
trigonometric Bézier curves, Shape parameters.

1. Introduction
In recent years rational schemes are replacing
polynomial schemes in CAGD. The integral (nonrational) model is extended to rational curves by
associating a weight to each control point. It is assumed
that all the weights are non negative so that all the
geometric properties of the scheme are upheld. The main
advantage of the rational form is that they can exactly
represent both conic sections [10] and non-rational
Bézier curves. They are also equivalent to non uniform
rational B-spline (NURBS) used in professional CAD
systems. The quadratic rational Bézier curves generally
termed as the conic section curves, have been broadly
used in industry due to its well-known properties and
easy effectuation for the designers. In CAD/CAM
systems, a circular arc and an ellipse can be expressed by
quadratic rational Bézier curves, but not by any
polynomial Bézier curves. Specifically the quadratic
rational Bézier curves are used in font design [11, 12] .

The study of curves and surfaces is a key element in
computer aided geometric design (CAGD) that has been
around for quite some time. The methods of CAGD have
arisen from the need of efficient computer representation
of practical curves and surfaces used in engineering
design. CAGD deals with the construction and
representation of free form curves and surfaces [1].
Cubic B-splines and Bézier curves have widely been
used in CAD systems and in CAGD applications as well.
However, their polynomial nature induces difficulties to
obtain the desired shapes. In order to overcome this
problem, splines with shape parameters have been
developed as an alternative. The shape parameters play a
vital role for interactive shape design. Keeping in view
the application potentialities of trigonometric splines,
Han [2] introduced a class of C1 quadratic trigonometric
polynomial curves with a shape parameter. This shape
parameters helped in better control on the shape of the
resulting curve and drawn it near to the control polygon
than the ordinary quadratic B-spline curves.

In this paper, a rational quadratic trigonometric Bézier
curve with two shape parameters is constructed which is
new in literature. The shape of the curve can be flexibly
controlled with shape parameter and weight without
changing the control points. The proposed curve bears all
the geometric properties of the ordinary rational Bézier
curve. This curve represents the arc of an ellipse and arc
of a circle for the specified coordinates of control points
with fixed values of shape parameters and weight as
well. It also exactly approximates the ordinary quadratic
rational Bézier curve for particular values of the shape
parameters.

Wu. X., et al [3] presented quadratic trigonometric spline
curves with multiple shape parameters analogous to
cubic B-spline curves attaining different levels of
parametric continuity for different values of the shape
parameters. Later piecewise quadratic trigonometric
polynomial curves with C 2 continuity were proposed in
Han [4]. Han [5] also presented cubic trigonometric
polynomial curves with a global shape parameter.

 Convex hull Property
The whole curve is contained in the convex hull of its
defining control points.

If the location of the control points P0 , P1 , P2 of the curve
is kept fixed, inverting their order and interchanging the
shape parameters m and n, the curve thus obtained
coincides with the former one only with the opposite
directions.
Mathematically,
f (u; m, n, P0 , P1 , P2 ) f (1 u ; n, m, P2 , P1 , P0 ),

4. Shape Control of the RQT- Bézier Curve
The parameters m and n control the shape of the curve
(3). While the control points Pi i 0,1, 2 are given,
keeping v and n fixed, the curve gets closer to PP
1 2 as the
value of m increases gradually in the range [ 1,1] .
Likewise for fixed values of v and m, the curve moves
towards P0 P1 as the value of n increases gradually in the
same interval. Accordingly; as m and n increase
simultaneously, with fixed v, the curve draws near to the
control polygon.

u [0,1], m, n  [ 1,1]
 Geometric invariance

The shape of the curve (3) is independent of the choice
of coordinates, i.e., it satisfies the following two
equations:

By and large, in RQT- Bézier curve, the weight v serves
as the shape parameter. The effect of changing weight is
different from that of moving the control point. The
curve is pulled towards the middle control point
as v assumes values from smaller to larger with the
assumption that v t 0 . The curve interpolates all the three
points for a large value of v never wandering off the
control polygon.

Theorem 4.1
The RQT- Bézier curve (3) becomes a straight line

For m n 1 , the basis functions (2) are:

manner, the curves leaning to the left side (dashed lines),

Theorem 5.1
Control polygons provide an important tool in geometric
modeling. It is an advantage if the curve being modeled
tends to preserve the shape of its control polygon. The
RQT- Bézier curve with two shape parameters is
analogous to ordinary rational quadratic Bézier curve
with same control points.

Let P0 , P1 , P2 be three control points of the RQT- Bézier
curve. If we take

7. Conclusion and Future Work
[10].

A newly constructed rational quadratic trigonometric
Bézier curve is presented in this paper which is
analogous to the ordinary rational quadratic Bézier
curve. The presence of shape parameters provides the
designer with an intuitive control on the shape of the
curve. The weight in the rational form also serves as the
shape control factor. Using the rational form has the
advantage over the integral form in the way that it
exactly represents some quadratic trigonometric curves
like ellipse and circle. The proposed curve best
approximates the ordinary rational Bézier curve and can
freely be adopted in CAD/CAM systems. This work can
be extended to the rational cubic trigonometric Bézier
curve with shape parameters which are more flexible
than the rational quadratic trigonometric Bézier curve.
Furthermore the tensor product trigonometric surfaces
can also be generated by the extended curves.
