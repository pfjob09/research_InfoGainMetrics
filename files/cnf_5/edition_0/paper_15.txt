Abstract

One of the prevalent mathematical representations of
curves and surfaces used in computer graphics and CAD
is Bézier curve. Their attractiveness is due to the fact that
they possess a number of mathematical properties which
enable their manipulation and analysis. Bézier curves,
both in integral and rational form have been studied by
many authors. Cubic trigonometric Bézier curves with
two shape parameters were presented by Han, et al [5]. It
carried all the geometric properties of ordinary cubic
Bézier curves and were used for the spur gear tooth
designing Abbas, et al [6]. Liu, et al [7] presented a study
on class of TC-Bézier curve with shape parameters.
Yang, et al [8] discussed trigonometric extension of
quartic Bézier curves attaining G 2 and C 3 continuity. A
class of general quartic apline curves with shape
parameters were introduced by Han [9]. Yang, L. et al
studied a class of quasi-quartic trigonometric Bézier
curves and surfaces [10].

A quartic trigonometric Bézier curve with two shape
parameters based on newly constructed trigonometric
basis functions is presented in this paper. The curve is
drawn by using end point curvature conditions and
carries all the geometric features of the ordinary quartic
Bézier curve. The presence of shape parameters provides
an opportunity to adjust the shape of the curve by simply
altering their values. The G 2 and C 2 continuity under
appropriate conditions is achieved by joining two pieces
of trigonometric curve.
Keywords-- Quartic trigonometric basis functions,

1. Introduction
Computer aided geometric design (CAGD) has come
into sight from the need of free form curves and surfaces
in CAD/CAM systems. Designing curves and surfaces is
a critical part in the construction of quite different
products such as car bodies, ship hulls, airplane fuselages
and wings etc. In addition the parametric representation
of curves and surfaces especially in polynomial form is
more under consideration in recent years due to the
limitations faced in using the planer curves. Furthermore
the trigonometric spline with shape parameters have
taken over the polynomial splines as it has been accepted
that there still exist some problems that cannot be solved
with polynomial splines or with any other generalized
splines as well. A class of C1 quadratic trigonometric
polynomial curves with a shape parameter were
introduced by Han [1]. Varying the values of the shape
parameter, the designer was free to adjust the shape of
the curve as compared to the ordinary quadratic B-Spline
curves. Han [2] proposed piecewise quadratic
trigonometric polynomial curves with C 2 continuity
analogous to the quadratic B-Spline curves which has
C1 continuity. Cubic trigonometric polynomial curves
with a shape parameter were presented by Han [3]. In
these papers the authors described the trigonometric
polynomial with global shape parameter. Single
parameter does not provide local control on the curves.
Wu, X. et al [4] introduced quadratic trigonometric
polynomial curves with multiple shape parameters.

A newly constructed quartic trigonometric Bézier curve
with two shape parameters attaining G 2 and C 2
continuity is presented in this paper. The proposed curve
inherits all the geometric properties of the ordinary
quartic Bézier curve and is used to construct open and
closed curves.
The paper is organized as: Some background, notations
and conventions are given is section 2. Quartic
trigonometric basis functions with two shape parameters
and the quartic trigonometric Bézier curve constructed
from these basis functions is given in section 3 and 4
respectively. In section 5, end point curvature is used to
evaluate the shape parameters and the geometric
properties of the developed curve are discussed. In
section 6 shape control of the curve, varying the values
of the shape parameters locally, is given and is applied to
construct open and closed curves. Continuity of the curve
is discussed in section 7. The conclusion with future
work is given in section 8.

curves drawn by increasing the values of both m and n
simultaneously
as
m n 1.5 (solid lines),

The shape parameters provide an intuitive control on the
shape of the curve. The values of the shape parameters
m and n can be used to attain the local control. While
the five control points Pi ( xi , yi ), i 0,1, 2,3, 4 of the
quartic trigonometric Bézier curve are given, for a fixed
value of the shape parameter n the curve leans to the
edge P1 P2 as the value m increases in the range [ 3,1] . In
the similar manner the curve slants towards the edge
P2 P3 as the value of the shape parameter n increases in
the same range with the value of m kept to be fixed.
Consequently the curve approaches the control polygon
as the value of m and n increase simultaneously.

curves. Figure 4 shows the open and closed curves

curves. For the closed curves we set Pn P0

8. Concluding Remarks and Future Work
In this paper, a newly constructed quartic trigonometric
Bézier curve with two shape parameters is presented
which inherits most of the geometric properties of the
ordinary Bézier curve. The shape of the curve can be
adjusted using the values of the shape parameters
obtained either by end point curvature or by altering
them locally. The two pieces of the curve can be joined
by G 2 and C 2 continuity under the appropriate
conditions. The proposed curve can be used to generate
open and closed curves. In future, the curve can be used
to generate the some trigonometric curves like arcs of
circle, ellipse or parabola under suitable conditions.
Further, it can be extended to tensor product surfaces.
