Abstract

There are a few researches on Thai handwriting
recognition systems [3]. Those works use methods that
analyze character’s heads with constructing of circular
direction and curve. However, there are problems with
accuracy and unclear characters. Another work is called
the online handwriting recognition system for the Thai,
English, numeral, and symbol characters [5]. This work
uses the eight direction steps with a neural network.
However, the system has a problem in slantwise
characters.
In this work, we found the best way to solve all
problems in the formal-research on Thai handwriting as
we shown in the result.

This research is a study of handwriting Thai
characters for computer use. This paper covers the
creation of an online handwriting recognition system by
using our proposed method. Our study shows the
character sampling number is 10 significant points. The
characters will be compared with a standard and
personal database which contains predefined character
information. Our method supports various writing and
different character styles. The average recognition rates
are of 87.89% in standard database and 94.93% in
personal database. Our proposed method is effective for
Thai handwriting character recognition.

2. Thai Characters
Thai characters can be classified into 4 main groups
[7] (consonants, vowels, numeral and tones). Obviously,
Thai characters are different from English. The Thai
characters can be combined by several characteristics
and features such as written style, size, height, width, and
spatial position. There are 44 Thai consonants and 16
vowel characters. Furthermore, there are also 4 tone
characters, ten numeral and some special characters

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the information technology is important
to people’s life due to the most of them are able to
understand writing language. These are new methods for
the generate knowledge education, entertainment,
businesses, and commerce. Thus, a mean to make a more
effective transfer of information should be fast and
convenient. Moreover, the tool should be improved in
quality. Computer and mobile phone are significant
advantage of information technology. One of the
important things to develop on computer and mobile
phone is to develop hand writing technology. The input
of character on computer is not only done by general
keyboard but also by using hand writing. This is an
interesting and convenient thing for storing data include
a new technology like touch screen which is suitable for
hand writing. By the way, the individual hand writing are
difference. Thus, the consistence of character is the data
processing. Furthermore, constructing of Thai
handwriting on touch screen mobile in Thai character is
necessary supporting for Thai citizen.

3. The Six Features in Thai Consonants
3.1 Head of Thai Consonant
The head of a Thai consonant is defined as a circle
and a closed loop. This identifies the initiation of writing
a Thai consonant. Most of Thai consonants have one
head. A few consonant have no head such as ก and ธ.

3.2. End of Thai Consonant
Every consonant must have an end point that can
be in four different zones such as upper left ( ง), upper
right (ค), middle left (ภ) and lower right ( ว).
87

3.3. Type style and size of text
Some consonants have more than one circle loop.
There are ten consonants that have two closed loops such
as ม and ณ.

3.4. Twist
The twist where two curves jointed can be found in
ณ and ฌ.

3.5. Piecewise Curve
Figure 2: Screenshot of writing a character into
the system.

An obvious characteristic of Thai consonants are
combined several kind of curves.

Step 2: The system will select ten, fifteen and twenty
sampling points from the input data points by a
systematic sampling. Each sampling point can be picked
up at every k point provided in the following equation.
K=
Where, n is the total number of points stored in the
training set database, m is the number of sampling
points, which are 10, 15 and 20. The number ten is
selected because it is the minimum sample points which
is still showed the correct and optimal results.

3.6. Straight Line
The last important feature of Thai consonants are
these straight lines. There may be more than one straight
line in a Thai consonant.

4. Thai Handwriting Character Recognition
Using Linear Interpolation Approach
Generally, there are two main processes for Thai
handwriting recognition: Training and Character
Recognition processes.

4.1. Training Algorithm
Step 1: The users input the samples of their own
handwriting in database.

Step 3: After collecting three sets of samples, the
training system will transform these control points into
vector forms. Then, 9 linear-interpolated vectors will be
calculated for each character in each set.
Step 4: Aggregate the collected data saved into text files
where one file will be used for one number of sampling
points that are 10, 15 and 20.

4.2. Character Recognition Algorithm
Step 1: When the user inputs their own handwriting, the
recognition system will calculate the distance from the
below formula
√(

s =∑

)

(

)

Step 3.2 Find the candidate character
Algorithm
Input: two sequences of data set
Output: Point

n be the number of sampling points

For i : 1 to m
If(x1[i] = x2[i])
Point++
End For

Step 2: Select four candidate characters with the lowest
distance.
Step 3: Compare data set that is generated from
sampling points of the hand writing character and the
other in our database.
Step 3.1:Generate a sequence of data set that represent
of a character.

The considered value = s – Point / 2

Step 4: Before displaying the correct matched character,
the system will check in the list of the candidate
characters for character specific uniqueness to help in
providing the accurate results. Using the cross product
formula to find head of character such as ค and ด, ฅ and

recognition from the standard library and personal
library. The user can add his/her handwriting into the
database.
Measuring of affects of control points can be
done by testing number of control points which are 10,
15, and 20 points. Then, compare those set with
databases proposed experiment and standard database.

From the related research for direction and
development of the online handwriting Thai character
recognition using linear interpolation approach helps
designing a system to process and analyze, Thai
handwriting to be converted into textual character
suitable for computer interpretation. The results of this
system are 87.89 % in standard database and 94.93% in
personal database. The system can be applied for
multiple character sizes and all character styles (slanted
characters). For more correctness, the users can store
their personal handwriting into the character database.

From the Table 2, the algorithm uses the length

15, and 20 not affect to percents correctness include
when comparing to standard database. Thus, this proves
that the proposed work is standard one.
From the testing of the 2 types of Thai
handwriting recognition through linear interpolation
which are the comparison with a general database and
that of the user’s personal database, the authors found
that comparison with a general database results in 87.89
