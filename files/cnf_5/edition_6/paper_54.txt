Xuan” has stronger ability of absorbing water and
diffusing ink than “Shou Xuan”. Different “Xuan” may
also have different density, which reflects the tightness
of its fibre distribution. For example, “Shou Xuan” has
bigger density than “Yuan Shu”. Density influences
the particle size of the “particle-phenomena” and the
extent of the regularity of the diffusion edge. Many
“Xuan” has some kinds of texture. The texture not only
provides the bottom shading for Chinese painting, but
also affects the direction of ink diffusion.

Abstract
In order to simulate the typical artistic effects of
Chinese Ink-Wash Drawing, a new simulation
approach based on physical modeling is presented. A
controllable physical paper model is built to imitate
the real fibre mesh of “Xuan”, based on which the
simulation system perfectly achieves the effectsimulating of Chinese Ink-Wash Drawing. As the basic
modeling unit, we first propose the concept of paper
cell, by pass simulating the random fibre distribution
of “Xuan”, this approach successfully simulated the
“particle phenomenon” and the irregular diffusion
edge. The experiment results indicate that the physical
paper model can simulate many different kinds of
“Xuan” by controlling parameters such as density,
water-absorbability and texture, so very natural and
similar-to-real simulation effects are achieved.

1. Introduction
Brush, ink, paper and ink-stone are known as four
jewels of Chinese Ink-Wash Drawing. Among them
paper and ink are two main painting materials, the
interaction of which results in kinds of special artistic
effects such as diffusing, sinking and traces of strokes.
It is these special effects, which distinguish Chinese
paintings from Western paintings.
After carefully observing any piece of Chinese
painting (as in figure 1), you will find that all the
original strokes and their diffusion areas appear to be
full of small particles (we call this “particlephenomena”) and that the edges of diffusion are
irregular. These special effects make the Chinese
paintings very natural, special and glamorous. And we
find they are directly related to the physical structure of
“Xuan”, the kind of paper used in Chinese Ink-Wash
Drawing.
There are many kinds of “Xuan”, which can be
generally divided into two categories: “Sheng Xuan”
and “Shou Xuan”. Their main difference resides in the
ability of absorbing water and diffusing ink. “Sheng

Since different structure and features of “Xuan”
paper determine the final drawing effect in some
degree, as figure2, so modeling of “Xuan” is very
important in the simulation of Chinese Painting.
Even though the simple matrix is widely used in the
simulating of canvas for western painting, the physical

modeling of “Xuan” is essential. Just the special sparse

fibre structure of “Xuan” paper provides the flowing
space for water, ink and pigment.

1.1. Related work
As the first paper model for simulating Oriental
painting and a preliminary concept for modeling the
random fibre structure of “Xuan”, Guo and Kunii [1]
proposed a 2D fibre structure. They divided the entire
paper field into regions in which each contained
curved lines drawn with random orientation. They
realized their model later in [Guo03]. Lee[2,3]
improves Kunii’s model by selecting a square region
division and generating paper with fibre structure
using sin curves. However some fatal flaws exists in
this kind of paper model. First, it is pixel-oriented, as
the basic units for ink diffusion, the fixed regions
(which are square matrix in Lee’s paper model) not
only causes the diffusion areas to be too regular and
smooth to be natural and real, but also cause the
aliasing of diffusion edges. Second, it is an
uncontrollable model, which is lack of augment ability.
It doesn’t consider the different characters for different
kinds of “Xuan” and their influences on the diffusion
effects. Finally, it doesn’t take the texture influence of
paper into account.

threads; (2) paper cell is the more reasonable concept
as the basic modeling unit; (3) decompose texture of
“Xuan” into structural texture and background texture,
which affect the final art effect considerately.

2. Physical modeling of “Xuan”
2.1. Physical model
The structure of “Xuan” is the platform for
diffusing and interacting between ink, water and paper.
So a data structure representing the physical structure
of “Xuan” is the basis for our model.
We divide every pixel of paper plane into n*n cells,
which we call “ paper cell”. The bigger n we use the
more precise model we get.
Idealizing the structure of “Xuan” we get a fiber
network like figure 4. To store this network our data
structure has a BlockList which is a list of fiber blocks
and a FiberList which is a list of fiber threads.

1.2. Our model of “Xuan”
Summing up predecessors’ experiences, we
creatively proposed an absolute physical paper model
to imitate the fibre structure of “Xuan”. Observing the
micro structure of “Xuan” in figure 3, we find that the
structure of “Xuan” is virtually a fibre network
composed of fibre piles(we call them fibre blocks) and
fibre threads, in which fibre blocks are linked by fibre
threads. We believe a physical paper model based on
this fibre network can make the simulation effects
more natural and real.

The distinct features of our model for “Xuan” include:

Figure 4. Idealized structure of “Xuan”
(“嗟” is a fiber blockˈ“ņ” is a fiber thread)
Each Block has two members:
1)CellCollection: A block is piled up by a lot of
fiber, which means each block occupy many
neighboring cells on the paper plane. The number of
cells in CellCollection reflects the size of this block.
The location of cells in CellCollection reflects the
location and also the shape of the block. Thus the
blocks in our fiber network are of different shapes and
different sizes, which thus better model the irregular
and random fiber distribution of “Xuan”.
2)FiberCollection: It’s a collection of fiber threads
which link this block with other blocks, which reflects
the connection of the network.
Each Fiber has a member BlockCollection, which is
a collection of blocks which are linked by this fiber
thread. Fiber thread is the pipe in the ink diffusion.
Our data structure also has some other parameters
such as paper size, partition coefficient n, density D
and water-absorbability A. Density represents the
compactness of fiber distribution of “Xuan” which
influences the particle size of the “particlephenomena” and the extent of the regularity of the
diffusion edge. Water-absorbability affects the
diffusion speed and extent. For example, “Sheng

Xuan” has bigger water-absorbability than “Shou
Xuan” has.

2.2. Structure-building algorithm
We described the data structure of the physical
model above. However, how can we automatically
build different structures for different kinds of “Xuan”
according to users’ needs? This is where the shoe
pinches and where the key problem lies in our model.
2.2.1. Rules for building
In order to model the real physical structure of
“Xuan”, our building process must obey the primary
rules of the fiber distribution of “Xuan”, which we
summarized as follow:
1) Fiber distribution must be “uniform in the whole
but random in every region”. “uniform in the whole”
means that the fiber distributed to every region is
‘uniform’ for the whole paper plane. ‘uniform’ means
that the amount of fiber for every region submit to
normal distribution N(­,¥), in which­is the same
for paper without texture or has an one-to-one
relationship with the Structural texture (see section 3)
for textured paper. “random in every region” means
that the fiber is randomly distributed within every
region (there our regions are pixel regions). This rule
is the key to model the irregular fiber distribution of
“Xuan”.
2) The number, length and direction of fiber threads
all submit to normal distribution.
2.2.2. Random-number-generation algorithm for
normal distribution
From above we can see that the most commonly
used algorithm in the building process is the randomnumber-generation algorithm. Our algorithm flow is as
follow:
Proc NRand (in ­, in ¥, out result)
//­is average valueˈ¥is square difference

r1 m Rand ()
r2 m Rand ()

C m  2 ln r1 u cos 2Sr2
result m P  G u C
End Proc
2.2.3 Building algorithm
For the first step, following the first rule mentioned
in section 2.2.1, we assign fiber to the “cell matrix”
according to the parameters given by users. For the
second step we combine the neighboring ‘cells’, which
has been assigned fiber into a fiber block. For the third
step we assign fiber threads to “cell matrix” following
the second rule in section 2.2.1, which we used to link
fiber blocks. For the final step we fill the generated

fiber blocks and fiber threads into our data structure
(BlockList and FiberList). Now we get into the details:
1) Assigning fiber to “cell matrix”: According the
Rule 1 in section 2.3.1, we can get an average number
Į for every pixel region, with which we can calculate
ȝ : ȝ=Į *D. Then we use the algorithm in section 2.2.2
to generate a random number as the number of “fiber
points” (indicate the amount of fiber) to be assigned to
every pixel region. Finally we assign each “fiber
points” to a random cell in the pixel region.
2) Combining cells into fiber blocks: we combine
the neighboring ‘cells’ which has been assigned fiber
into a fiber block, which is then added to the BlockList.
3) Assigning fiber threads to “cell matrix”: we use
the algorithm in section 2.3.2 to generate a number
num indicating the number of threads to be assigned.
Then for every thread we also use this algorithm to
calculate the length and direction. There both the
average number of threads avg_threads and the
average length of threads avg_length are proportion to
the density of the paper D.
4) Linking fiber blocks: First we adding every fiber
thread into FiberList. Second we calculate the blocks
each thread crosses which are then recorded into
BlockCollection of the corresponding Fiber. Finally we
record the Fiber in the FiberCollection of Blocks it
crosses.

3. Modeling the texture
3.1. Influence of texture upon diffusion
Influence of texture upon diffusion can be classified
into two aspects: one is affecting the direction of
diffusion; the other is providing the bottom shading for
painting.
So we decompose texture of “Xuan” into two parts:
structural texture and background texture. Structural
texture determines the fiber structure of “Xuan”, which
influence the direction of the diffusion and the range of
the diffusion area. Background texture is the bottom
shading of “Xuan”, which may be a piece of colorful
picture. Structural texture usually has some connection
with background texture, but it can be not the case.

3.2. Importing structural texture
This section solves
the problem how to
importing structural
texture into the paper
model so that it is
stored in our data
structure of the paper
and reflected by the
Figure 5. Gray picture
simulation effect.
Structural texture is
built from a piece of gray picture (like figure 5). In the

gray picture, the black skeleton indicates the desired
skeleton of texture, which determines the fiber
distribution of “Xuan”. For every pixel the bigger its
gray value is, the more dense fiber (which means more
“fiber points”) it has. Following this rule the average
number of “fiber points” ȝi every pixel region should
assign can be calculated by a formula as follow:

Pi

( M  m) *

Ri
m
Max( Ri )

Here Ri is the gray value of the according pixel in
the gray picture, M and m are respectively the top and
bottom bound of the number of “fiber points” a pixel
region can assign.

3.3. Adding Background texture
In order to make the simulated Chinese painting
reflect the bottom shading of “Xuan” like in real world,
we has to add the background texture to the original
stroke. There we know two RGB values of the same
pixels in Background texture and the original stroke,
and we want to get a RGB value after “adding”.
The simple RGB method couldn’t solve the
problem of pigment mixing. The subtractive color
synthesis CMY is also only suitable for modeling the
effect of light transmission through colored surfaces.
Both of them can’t solve the pigment mixing which
has both transmitting and reflecting characteristics.
Because both the ink particle and the texture are
pigmented object, we introduce the Kubelka-Munk
(KM) theory [4] of pigment mixing to facilitate correct
color calculation for realistic simulation. KM model is
widely used by painting industries. Curtis et al. apply
this model to compute generated watercolor and
achieve a wonderful effect [5]. So we introduce this
model into our pigment mixing in simulating Chinese
Ink-Wash Drawing. We take three steps to solve the
“adding” of background texture and the original stroke:
First step: Texture synthesis. Special technology of
texture synthesis [6] is used to generate a background
graph for paper plane based upon a sample texture
given by users. From this graph we can get the optical
value of texture layer Lg(Rg=R/255,Tg=0;R is one of
RGB components) for RGB channels respectively.
Second step: Calculating the optical value of the
stroke layer Lt(Rt,Tt). For the pigments in the pixel
region, we know a RGB value which is the appearance
of the pigments over a white background, and the
density of pigments 1/ȕ(0<1/ȕ< and 1/ȕ=Rt/Tt).
Then the optical value Lt(Rt,Tt) can be computed by
inversely applying the KM optical compositing
equations:

Then

Third step: Putting the stroke layer over the texture
layer, the RGB values Rc after “adding” can be
respectively calculated by applying the KM optical
compositing equations:

Experiments proved that KM model is not only
suitable for the “adding” of Background texture with
original stroke, but also suitable for the pigment
mixing when simulating the drawing with various
colored pigments in Chinese Ink-Wash Drawing
(mentioned that in Chinese Ink-Wash Drawing there
are also many kinds of colored pigments other than
black ink that painters can use).

4. Diffusion based on physical paper model
The diffusion algorithm based on “Particle System”
[7] is introduced to simulate the diffusion on our
physical paper model, where we make some
improvements as follow:
First, the platform for ink diffusion is not pixels any
longer, but fiber blocks. In blocks ink’s movement is
not merely upward, downward, left and right, but
guided by fiber threads which link the block to other
blocks. This is the key to migrate the “Particle System”
to physical paper model.
Second, both ink particle and water particle move
together in diffusion process considering the special
and important effect of water during real diffusion.
Water is the media of the interaction among brush, ink,
color pigments and paper. Water influences the
diffusing and ink-sinking process. Water plays an
important role in the whole Chinese Ink-Wash
Drawing. So water particle is imported in our diffusion
algorithm to play two roles. One is acting as the carrier
of ink which can’t move without enough water. The
other is pulling ink particles to move when there is
adequate gap between the two water levels.
Third, make the “Fake Brown Motion” [7] run
everywhere at any time. Because the real diffusion is a
dynamic process which not only occurs on the edges of
diffusion, but occurs everywhere at any time. Thus we
can avoid “edge detection” and also improves the
reality of simulation result.
Finally, the data structure and other parameters of
“Xuan” determine the “Fake Brown Movement”. The

absorbability of water affects the move speed of
particles (the more the absorbability is, the faster
particles move). The particle’s intensity gap between
two linked fiber blocks influences the moving
direction and speed of particles during diffusion
(particles move from the one with bigger intensity to
the one with smaller intensity, and the bigger the gap is,
the faster particles move).
The improved “Particle System” based on physical
paper model is simply described as follow:
Proc Diffuse
balanceĸfalse
while(!balance) do
for each Block g in BlockList do
Brown(in g, out balance)
End for
End while
End Proc
Here, Brown (in g, out balance) is the process of
“Fake Brown Motion”. A new physical diffusion
algorithm, which is more suitable for physical paper
model is under research.

5. Experimental Results
Based on the proposed physical paper model we
developed a simulation system. After the user giving a
graph of original strokes and setting some
characteristic parameters of “Xuan”, the system runs
and generates a result graph of simulation. Setting
different parameter values the user can get different
kinds of “Xuan” with different characters, according to
which the simulation results are also different just like
real painting on different kinds of “Xuan”. The main
parameters the user can control are density D, waterabsorbability A, gray picture for structural texture and
image for background texture. We analysis these
parameters’ effects on simulation results one by one:

5.1. Density
Given different value for density D, paper structures
with different fiber-distribution-density can be
obtained. As far as the simulation result is concerned,
the bigger the density is, the smoother the sequent
strokes are, the smaller the particle size of the particlenomena” is, the more regular the diffusion edges are
(result 1 in table 6), and vice versa (result 2 in table 6).

5.2. Water-absorbability
Water-absorbability A influences the speed and
extent of diffusion. The bigger the water-absorbability
is, the faster the diffusion is, the wider the diffusion
area is (result 1 in table 7), and vice versa (result 2 in
table 7).

5.3. Texture
Simulating the effect of texture upon the diffusion
result is wonderfully achieved by our simulation
system. Table 8 shows the experiment results:

6. Conclusion and prospects
A controllable physical paper model and the
simulation method based on it are proposed.
Experiments proved that this physical simulation
method achieves a very natural and real result. The
paper model can imitate different kinds of “Xuan” or
“Xuan” with various textures just like choosing
“Xuan” in real Chinese Ink-Wash Drawing. Simulation
results made by our system on different kinds of
“Xuan” are very similar to real paintings. Figure 9
shows a complete Chinese painting work produced by
our simulation system.

Our paper model is not complete. First some more
characteristic parameters should be introduced to
enrich our model. Second we need a “paper parameters
database” based on the model to store the majority
kinds of commonly used “Xuan”, which can be
obtained by experiments. Finally it must be pointed out
that the physical simulation of Chinese Ink-Wash
Drawing can be not integrate until a physical brush
model and a physical diffusion model are combined
with this physical paper model, because brush, ink and
paper is a whole in Chinese Ink-Wash Drawing.
