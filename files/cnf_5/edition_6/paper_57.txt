Abstract
This paper introduces a new kind of mosaic, called
the Decorative PixMosaic, where photo tiles of square
shapes are used to compose the final image. We can
express the resulting image with a similar color
distribution of input images from small photo tiles. Based
on an input image, user-selected edge features and a
wide range of photo tiles, the method can both reproduce
the image’s textures and emphasize the selected edges by
placing tiles that follow the edges. The voronoi site is
situated in the center point of the tile using the
Centroidal Voronoi Diagram for equally maintaining the
distance among the tiles. To express the edges using tiles
on the voronoi site as the center point, tiles do not cross
image edges and are drawn up as following edge’s
direction. We use a distribution photo with similar color
selected from the photo database. It is important to
search for a visually similar photo. Hence we must have
a large number of photo tiles.

1. Introduction
Non-Photorealistic Rendering is the general term for
rendering techniques that use various painting materials.
This paper suggests a new method which is simulated
mosaic in the field of NPR.
Mosaic is an art technique which decorates the wall
or floor of structure with small pieces such as marble or
glass. It has developed into a method of pictorial
presentation. Figure 1 is a mosaic of Greek Delos island
representative of mosaic work during the Byzantine era.
It is a large image generated using a collection of many
small rectangle tiles. We can maximize the decorative
effect with gaps between the non overlapping tiles.
For representing photographic images, Photo
Mosaic(=PixMosaic) is composed of tiles, and has been
developed and is used in commercial applications, such
as posters and advertisements. Photo mosaic divides the

input image into square lattices and then, assigns photos
with the most analogous tone of color distribution for
each lattice. Therefore, the mosaic fundamental principle
is to depict a large image with the collection of small
tiles. We can then generate various mosaic types
according to the position, shape and texture of the tiles.
We generate modern photo mosaic using the
position and direction of the tile which can be found in
an existing classical mosaic.

2. Related work
In the computer graphics literature, the works most
closely related to our approach are the various mosaicing
algorithms that can be categorized by the choice of tiles
and the restriction on their placement.
Simulated Decorative Mosaic[4] approaches the
problem of aligning square tiles with varying orientations
to preserve input image edges while maximizing the area
covered by the colored tiles. This method obtains the
satisfactory result image at input image having constant
colors. But the input image with complicated color can’t
express the detailed area.
Photomosaic[7], Roberts Silver suggested, divided
the input image into square grid. And then he kept each
grid in photo tile. This way can present edges of input
image into photo tile. However it shows the image with
the low resolution. So this paper accentuated the edges in

the input image with comprising of merits of those
papers that has both good resolution and minute
representation.

There we can simulate the tiling method of a classic
decorative mosaic.

The Decorative mosaic technique requires some
regular spacing between uniform rectangle tiles. These
spaces help smooth rotation and prevent them from
concentrating in any specific position.
The centroidal voronoi diagram is necessary for this
mosaic technique. It is based on the voronoi diagram.
Initially, the voronoi diagram is divided into
continuously from inducing point of an area. The
boundary between voronoi sites, is determined by
placing a line equidistant from the sites, perpendicular to
the line connecting them. Figure 3(a) shows the results of
generating several polygons by this method. The voronoi
sites are located randomly, and the polygons vary in size
and shape. Reiterative figured the voronoi sites relative
to the polygon centroid is uplifted to smooth the results.
So voronoi sites move position of the centroidal point
little by little. The final polygon structure, in the
centroidal voronoi diagram, is a regular sized polygon,
like honeycomb as shown in the figure 3(b).
Finally
the gaps among the tiles maintain,
uniformity and the square tiles of comparable size are
placed at the voronoi site to maintain this uniformity.

The direction of the tile is an important matter with
its position in the event generating photo mosaic using
exact square tiles. A straight side of the tile is utilized for
fixing its direction according to the properties of the
exact rectangular. In this paper, the straight side is
positioned parallel to the tangent of the closest edge from
the central point of its tile. As explained in the previous
paragraph, we distribute the central points then generate
exact rectangular tiles regardless of the direction from
those points. The straight side of the tile rotates so that it
is parallel to the tangent of the closest edge. In this case,
neighboring tiles on an edge have the similar directional
properties since most of them follow the tangent of the
surrounding edges. We assigned weights according to the
proximity to edges then reduced the effect for tiles far
from the edge. Tiles have direction according to the edge,
such that there should be no problems to recognize
objects with only uniform exact rectangular tiles. Edges
that surrounded objects in the input image come into
prominence. The effects of decoration are conspicuous
with embossing edge by sequence according to the
position of tiles and the spacing of them.

3.3. Edge expression
It can’t be said to simulate completely only by fixing
the position of tiles using the centroidal voronoi diagram
then rotating parallel to the tangent of the nearest edge.
One problem is that it is unconcerned about generating
tiles above the edge area that is user selected.
A more significant feature for photo mosaic is
representing the edge by taking advantage of space
between tiles. In figure 4, the edge is represented by
sequential spaces among tiles before the tiles are
positioned while avoiding the edge. The edges are
thickened, widening the spacing tile around the edge by
iterative centroidal voronoi diagram. Reusing the
centroidal voroni diagram except with thick edge lines,
narrows those widened spaces induced by tiles. Then,
until it is similar to the spaces between tiles around the
edge, CVD is performed iteratively by user. This
method follows the direction of the edge, and more
importantly avoids placing tiles on the edge. For this way
the last position and direction of tiles are fixed. We can
generate photo mosaic images by only fixing color or
texture of the tile for the next step. In the following
section, the technique is explained to create a similar
image as a vision, applying the texture of tiles.

preprocess as a square shape. When creating a mosaic
database, information such as photo file name, average
color value of the total region and color information of
the tile region is saved. And tile matching time is
reduced by eliminating the first photo having a definite
difference of average color value compared to the
candidate tiles. Next, we search for and optimal photo as
using the original tile to select candidate tiles.
The optimal photo is the photo having most similar
color distribution in tile region of the input image. It is
very important work to search it at this research. Figure 5
shows the tile region of a source image and a photo tile.
We choose small candidate tiles among photo database
that have a value within the proper range using the
following formula. Managed thus, we search for the
photo having similar color distribution. Then, finally, we
select the tile having the shortest color distance as the
final photo tile among candidate tiles in pixel
comparison. The selected photo is placed in the rotated
tile region matching with the input image.

3.4. Optimal Photo Matching
There is only a representation of one constant color
in each texture of the tile from the existing Decorative
Mosaics. This technique uses color decision method by
sampling the average color value in the input image’s
same position.
This paper presents a new method using photos as
textures for tiles and is different from existing method.
We must have many various photos to satisfy tile regions
having diverse color information. This research used
10700 pieces of flower photos. For the main subject
expression, it is effective to produce a photo mosaic as
photos having common subjects, such as people, animals,
flowers, cars. It is easy to match tiles since tile shape

4. Conclusion
In this study, we determined the location and
direction of tiles for a decorative effect in the input
image. We suggest creating a photo mosaic image using
photos as tiles’ texture. This method emphasizes edges of
the input image as it merges classical and modern
features. This is necessary to recognize the object
because user-selected edges are represented using the
straight side of a tile. And then we create a gorgeous

photo mosaic since we use photos having various
colors and patterns similar to the tile’s texture. This paper
presents a method to decide position and direction of tile
using user-selected edge in source image. We will
automatically extract the object’s edge using segmentation
method in the source image and search for the most
suitable photo to express the edge detail using its color in
the future. In future work, we will adapt this method to
segment the object in the source image by layers.
