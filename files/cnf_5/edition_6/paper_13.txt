Abstract
A novel SAR super-resolution imaging method is
described. Firstly, SAR image peak extraction is
carried out in the image domain and the coarse feature
parameter estimation is obtained. Secondly, Parameter
estimation of nonlinear regressive model is carried out
in the phase history domain and the fine feature
parameter estimation is obtained. Finally, from the
estimated parameter and based on the point-scattering
model, the simulated phase history data of large
dimensions is generated. By FFT imaging, higher

have shown that this method offer significant
advantages over the FFT methods to better resolve the
dominant target scatterers.

2. Point scattering model in phase history
domain
Based on the geometric theory of diffraction
(GTD), if the wavelength of the incident excitation is
small relative to the target extent, then the
backscattered field from an object is well modeled as a
sum of responses from individual scattering centers.
We assumed that under the measurement of frequency
and aspect angle, the total scattered field from an object
is then modeled as a sum of contributions of
p individual scattering terms [2]:

Introduction

By using modern spectral estimation method to
get high quality SAR imaging is the most attractive
domain of SAR super-resolution imaging at present. In
modern spectral estimation method, radar imaging is
modeled as a two-dimension spectral estimation
problem. By using high precision parameter estimation
method, the fine location and amplitude estimation of
the scattering center is obtained. In [2], based on point
scattering model, a ML estimator can get more accurate
estimation of the feature parameter of scattering center
than other modern spectral estimation such as
antireflection (AR) method and the Music algorithm
etc. However, due to the need for a good initial guess to
converge to the global minima, the MLE has not been
widely used in radar imaging. In this paper, a novel
SAR super-resolution imaging method is described.
Firstly, SAR image peak extraction is carried out in the
image domain and the coarse feature parameter
estimation is obtained. Secondly, Parameter estimation
of nonlinear regressive model is carried out in the
phase history domain and the fine feature parameter
estimation is obtained. Finally, from the estimated
parameter and based on the point-scattering model, the
simulated phase history data of large dimensions is
generated. By FFT imaging, higher resolution image is
obtained.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In

Gauss-Newton iteration continues until the
estimation value of the parameter vector β becomes
stable. The universal criteria for convergence is test the
estimated parameter increment. Another criteria tests
whether the sum of the square error of the parameter
makes little change during the iteration or not. The
major problem of these criteria is that it only pinpoint
the iteration is not developing but not converging.
Under most circumstances, the iteration terminates
when the minimum has been reached but there may be
another case that the iteration terminates but the
minimum has not been reached. To overcome this
problem, we use the criteria based on the geometry
contribution of the nonlinear least square named the
relative bias criteria

We segment the SAR amplitude image using a
watershed[4] based algorithm. We can get the isolate
regions of high energy in the image. The algorithm
operates by treating the amplitude of the SAR image as
a three-dimension landscape under water. As the water
is drained, the largest peak surfaces appear first and
then 3dB and 20 dB regions below the largest peak
appear. We do not include pixels whose amplitude is
less than 20dB below the largest peak, assuming they
are mainly due to noise and clutter. We sort these
pixels out from high to low according to pixel
amplitude, decide whether it may be a new peak by
some rule or not. The rule is that if it is a new
peak ,it should be the biggest in its 5 h 5
neighborhood. Therefore we can deduce how many
scatterers there are according to the number of the peak.
So we can obtain the number of the scatterers and thus
obtain the model order estimation. When the SNR of
the SAR image is high, this model order estimation
method is very efficient. When the SNR of the SAR
image is not very high, the bias is inevitable due to
peak extraction error. We can choose another robust
model order estimation such as MDL [5] to get the
more precisely model order estimation
We can use the method of peak extraction [6] with
sub-pixel precision to obtain the initial estimation of
the location and amplitude of each scattering center.

In practical processingˈ if the column of the
gradient matrix ∇F ( β ) is linear dependent, the
gradient matrix will be singular. This is one of the
causes that induce the unstable phenomenon of the
Gauss-Newton iteration. Generally, the most efficient
method to deal with singularity is to modify the
Gauss-Newton increment. That is to modify L in the
iteration procedure (iii) as above. We can modify the
(i )

diagonal elements of the ∇F ( β ) ∇F ( β ) .
How to modify the diagonal elements depends on the
known prior information. As for SAR imaging, we can
exploit some prior information of the feature of the

The initial estimation of the feature parameter
vector β has an influence on the convergence of the
iteration. If an unsuitable initial estimation is selected,
the algorithm will not converge yet. In order to
decrease the iteration complexity and to find the
optimal solution rapidly, the initial estimation should
be chosen near to the actual value as possible. So it is
essential to obtain a more precision initial parameter
estimation value. In this paper, a convenient and

7. Conclusions
A novel SAR super-resolution imaging method is
described. Experimental examples have shown that this
method offer significant advantages over the FFT
methods to better resolve the dominant target
scatterers.
At present, SAR super-resolution processing
methods are limited to SAR images of relative little
size [1][2][7][8]. As for larger SAR images, the
scatterers number is big. Due to the complexity of the
nonlinear regressive model parameter estimation, our
method seems intractable. In order to super-resolved
larger SAR images, as [8] has mentioned, we can
extract subimages of little size from the original image
and transform it back to phase history domain.
Super-resolution processing is applied in this data
domain. Super-resolved subimages can be placed back
into its appropriate location in the original SAR image.
Of course, we can repeat this process (parallel
