Abstract
During progressive transmission of 3D geometry
models, the transmission order of details at different
region has great effects on the quality of reconstructed
models at low bit-rate. This work presents a ratedistortion (R-D) optimized progressive geometry
compression scheme to improve the quality of
reconstructed models by adjusting the transmission order
of details. In this scheme, the input mesh is partitioned
into parts, then each part is encoded into bit-stream
independently, and the encoded bit-streams are truncated
into segments while getting the R-D characteristics of
every segment, at last all segments are assembled into a
codestream based on R-D optimization, which ensure the
region with rich detail will be transmitted early and make
the reconstructed mesh achieve better quality as soon as
possible. Experimental results show that, as compared
with the well-known PGC method, the proposed one
provides better R-D performance. Moreover, it provides a
novel way to realize the region of interest (ROI) coding of
3D meshes.

Introduction

Since 3D graphic data usually possess huge amount
of size, the compression of 3D graphic data [1-3] is very
essential to facilitate the storage and transmission of 3D
models. The progressive compression techniques are
useful especially when transmitting a huge model, since
they enable successive reconstruction of model from low
to high resolutions. Once the visual quality of
reconstructed model meets clients’ satisfaction, the
transmission can be intermitted, and transmission
bandwidth and storage space are saved consequently. The
wavelet-based algorithm, such as the PGC [3], provides
superior compression ratio. In PGC, through the wavelet
transform, the input mesh can be replaced by a coarsest
mesh and a sequence of wavelet coefficients, and then the
coefficients can be organized by zerotrees effectively. At

last, the zerotrees are encoded using SPIHT algorithm to
get the progressive codestream. There are many related
works, [4] provided the generated codestream with the
quality and resolution scalability to be adapted to the
heterogeneity of Internet bandwidth and terminals’
graphics capabilities; [5] proposed that only data of
visible regions are transmitted and decoded to save
network bandwidth and decoding resources; [6]
implemented ROI coding of 3D mesh by scaling up the
bitplanes of ROI; [7] proposed an approach to R-D
optimized compression and view-dependent transmission
of 3D normal meshes.
Although the wavelet-based algorithm achieves a
high R-D performance, the local characteristics of
wavelet coefficients can be exploited to improve the R-D
performance further. In this work, a novel scheme for RD optimized progressive geometry compression is
proposed. Firstly, the semi-regular mesh is partitioned
into parts, and then each part is compressed into a single
bit-stream independently. At last, an optimal rate is
assigned to each part to minimize the geometry distortion
subject to the constraint on a total rate with the Lagrange
multiplier method. Experiment results demonstrate that
the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art coding gain
while providing a better R-D performance than PGC.
Furthermore, this work provides a new scheme to
implement ROI coding of 3D meshes.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces the R-D optimized compression. Section 3
describes how to implement ROI coding in our algorithm.
Experimental results are showed in section 4. Finally, the
conclusion is given.

2. R-D Optimized Compression
2.1. Encoding
Since the existing wavelet transforms are only used
on semi-regular mesh, a remeshing step must be taken to
convert the irregular mesh into semi-regular. We adopted
MAPS [8] remeshing and Butterfly wavelet [9] in our
implementation.
Consequently,
through
wavelet
transform, the input model can be represented by the base

mesh and a series of wavelet coefficients. Base mesh can
be encoded using EdgeBreaker[2]. All the wavelets
coefficients would be partitioned grouped into zerotrees,
and each zerotree is encoded into bit-stream using the
modified SPIHT algorithm [5].

2.2. Optimal Truncation of Bit-streams

2.2.2. The feasible truncation points

2.2.1. R-D Optimization
Suppose there are m edges in the base mesh. Let Li
(1im) denotes the bit-stream of the ith zerotree, whose
root is the ith edge in the base mesh. And L ni denotes the
first ni bits in Li. The length of the encoded bit-stream
t
L ni is R i. And the quality contribution of L ni to the
i

i

i

reconstructed mesh is D in . The optimal selection of the
truncation points is to minimize distortion subject to a
constraint rate Rmax. We adopted the Langrage multiplier
to solve the optimal problem. To get the optimal
truncation set, we must solve the following function:
i

m

m

i =1

i =1

m in( ¦ D in i + λ ( ¦ R in i − R m ax ))

(1)

Here Ȝ is the Langrage multiplier. Since zerotrees are
encoded independently, the encoded bit-streams are
irrelevant. Therefore, the whole minimization problems
can be converted to the separate ones for each bit-stream:
m

Because of the convexity of R-D curves of each bitstream, the following simple algorithm can be used to
find the optimal truncation point.

points Ni={j1 ˈj2 ˈj3 ˈĂ }ˈ( j1<j2<j3<Ă)at each bitstream. And then, let k denotes the kth truncation point,
the corresponding distortion-rate ratio is given
by R D i jk = Δ D i jk / Δ R i jk . Then, these ratios can be
taken as valid candidates of Ȝ.
Finally, the arithmetic coder [11] is adopted to
further improve the compression efficiency.

then

In the modified SPIHT algorithm, the encoded bitstreams are composed with zero and one, which
represents three kind of bit: significant bits, sign bits and
magnitude bits. The bit-streams can be truncated at any
bit. Only when the bit is the significant bit or magnitude
bit, the value of the bit is one and the bit is related with a
wavelet coefficient, the bit brings contribution to improve
the quality of the reconstructed model, which is defined
as the flexible truncation point in this paper. A segment is
defined as a set of bits between two consecutive
truncation points including the first important bit.

2.2.3. Distortion Estimation
The geometry distortion D(M ˈ Mƍ)between the
remeshed mesh M and the reconstructed mesh Mƍ can be
defined as:

[( x − x ') 2 + ( y − y ') 2 + ( z − z ') 2 ]

Where V is the number of vertices in M, (xi, yi, zi) and (xiƍ,
yiƍ, ziƍ) denote position of v in the remeshed and
reconstructed model, respectively. There are L level
resolutions in mesh M and Mƍ.
Butterfly wavelet is chosen in this paper for its
simplicity. The Butterfly wavelet stencil is given in
Figure 2 (a), which shows the vertex at the fine level (v)
and its 8 neighbor vertices at the coarser level (v1, v2, f1, f2,
e1, e2, e3, e4)

niλ = j.

By varying Ȝ, the optimal truncation points
satisfying the rate constraint can be found. Figure 1
illustrates the layered codestream concept and the effect
of truncating the bit-stream between the first and second
layers.

code-streams in quality layers.
However, it is not easy to find the appropriate Ȝ in
practice. In this work, we first find the feasible truncation

Locally associated vertices at the finer level

Based on the structure in Figure 2(a), the prediction
of the new vertex (v) can be represented by the sum of the
weighted average of 8 neighbor vertices. And the vertices
in the l th level can be grouped into three types: vƍ= {v1,
v2}, f ƍ= {f1, f2} and eƍ= {e1, e2, e3, e4}, which are used to
predict v with weights 1/2, 1/8 and -1/16, respectively.
Since the wavelet coefficients are the prediction errors,
the distortion is related to the mean squared error of
wavelet coefficients. As Figure 2 (b) shown, in the
processing of prediction, the vertices in the l th level (s)

would take three kind of roles: vƍ, f ƍand eƍ. Therefore, the
position error in the lth level propagates to the
neighboring vertices at the finer level, and the
propagation effect including it self can be approximated
though multiplying a weight parameter Ȧ.

ROI coding of 3D meshes

In applications, the clients are only interested in
some special region of 3D model. JPEG2000 [12]
proposed a scheme for ROI coding of image, which
would sacrifice image quality at the uninterested region,
background (BG), and enhance image quality at the ROI,
foreground. Inspired by JPEG2000, [6] proposes the
notion of ROI coding of 3D meshes at the first time and
defines two kinds of ROI coding methods: the general
scaling-based method and the maximum shift method.
Following the algorithm mentioned above, through
adjusting the R-D ratio of segments in ROI, the details in
ROI can be transmitted preferentially, which makes the
quality of ROI can be improved as soon as possible.
In our work, the ROI and the degree of interest Į
˄ 0Į1 ˅ can be specified by coder or user. Let W
denotes the total bitplane level in modified SPIHT coding
process. The R-D ratios in ROI would be adjusted by the
following equation:

The position errors at the lth level can be propagated to
other finer level in this way; and the errors can be further
propagated to the whole mesh and the propagation can be
approximated by a weighting parameter¹L-l.
And then the coefficients would be quantized and
encoded using the modified SPIHT algorithm. Let ǻ
denote the quantization step and pik denote the bitplane of
the kth truncation point of the ith bit-stream. The encoded
bit-streams are consisted of “0” and “1”, and the
magnitude of “1” is 2 p * Δ ; therefore, the reduction of
distortion at the feasible truncation point can be obtained
by the following function:
k
(5)
Δ D ik = ω L − l * (2 p i * Δ ) 2
Generally speaking, the wavelet coefficients at a
lower level represent low frequency information, which
are used to predict ones at a higher level; when the
truncation point lies in a higher bit-plane, it represents a
bigger magnitude.

our algorithm gives more free to adjust the degree of
interest.

We compare the R-D performance of our proposed
method with that of the PGC scheme [3]. For a fair
comparison, in this experiment, the PGC algorithm
adopted Butterfly wavelet transformation. To get the
same compression ratio, in this experiment, the arithmetic
coder wasn’t adopted in both algorithms. And the base
meshes are compressed using EdgeBreaker[2]. Figure 3
shows the R-D curve of the proposed and the PGC. The
distortion of the remeshed model is measured using the
METRO [13] in unit of 10-4, and the length of codestream is measured by the unit of bit per vertex (bpv).

model and (b) the Venus model.

The experimental results indicate that our proposed
algorithm provides a better R-D performance than the
PGC, especially for the model with rich detail. At low bitrate, our algorithm shows better R-D performance since
the bits are allocated preferentially to segments
contributing more to the quality of reconstructed model.
In next experiment, the arithmetic coder [11] is
adopted to further improve the compression efficiency.
Figure 5 shows the reconstructed model at various levels.

After adjusting the R-D ratio, all the packets are

Compared to [6], our algorithm needn’t create the
mask to specify the ROI; since scaling up coefficients has
not been happened in our proposed algorithm, it is not
necessary to transmit the additional data and to scale
down the coefficients in decode processing. Furthermore,

It is clear that the model quality achieved better
visual appearance at earlier stage. For example, the
reconstructed model of the fifth level (Figure5 (c)) is
similar with that of the last level (Figure 5 (d)) by vision,
while the previous one only requires lower bit-rate.

this experiment. Figure 4 shows the constructed model
when users only receive the base mesh and the specified
ROI. Figure 4 (a) shows the original model and Figure 4

the base mesh and ROI at various view position,
respectively.

Conclusions
A progressive geometry compression algorithm,
based on the R-D optimization, was proposed in this work.
The algorithm partitioned the input mesh into parts,
progressively compressed each part into bit-streams
independently, and then allocated an optimal bitrate to
minimize the overall geometry distortion. At the receiver
end, the decoder can stop at any point while giving a
reconstruction of the input model with the best R-D
tradeoff. A geometry distortion model was developed to
reduce the computational complexity of the optimization
process. Experiment results demonstrated that the
proposed algorithm provided better R-D performance
than the PGC. What’s more, the algorithm was also used
to implement ROI coding of 3D meshes efficiently.
