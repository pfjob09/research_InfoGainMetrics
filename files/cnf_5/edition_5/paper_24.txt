Abstract
The novel approach combines colour and
texture features for content based image retrieval.
Features like colour and texture are obtained by
computing the measure of standard deviation in
combination with energy on each colour band of
image and sub band of wavelet. Wavelet transform
is used for decomposing the image into 2x2 subbands. Feature database in content-based image
retrieval of 640 Visual texture (VisTex) color
images is constructed. It is observed that proposed
method outperforms the other conventional
histograms and standard wavelet decomposition
techniques.

1. Introduction
Application of world wide web (www) and the
internet is increasing exponentially, and with it the
amount of digital image data accessible to the users.
A huge amount of Image databases are added every
minute and so is the need for effective and efficient
image retrieval systems. There are many features of
content-based image retrieval but four of them are
considered to be the main features. They are colour,
texture, shape, and spatial properties. Spatial
properties, however, are implicitly taken into
account so the main features to investigate are
colour, texture and shape. Though there are many
techniques of search this paper will focus on colour
and texture features for CBIR. The main motivation
of the present work is to use the decomposition
scheme based on colour planes in combination with
histograms, which yield improved retrieval
performance. Advantage of three-colour plane
wavelet decomposition is that it yields a large
number of sub bands, which improves the retrieval
accuracy. Through combination of standard wavelet
decomposition on colour planes and histograms we
can increase the number of features, which in turn
improves the retrieval accuracy. To support the
efficient and fast retrieval of similar images from
image databases feature extraction plays an
important role in content-based image retrieval. A

fundamental ingredient for content based image
retrieval is the technique used for comparing images.

2. Colour
Colour not only adds beauty to objects but also
more information [1], which is used as powerful tool
in content-based image retrieval. In color indexing,
given a query image, the goal is to retrieve all the
images whose color and texture compositions are
similar to those of query image. In color image
retrieval there are various methods, but here we will
discuss some prominent methods.
Typical characterization of color composition is
done by color histograms. In 1991 Swain and
Ballard [2] proposed the method, called color
indexing, which identifies the object using color
histogram indexing. Color histograms are way to
represent the distribution of colors in images where
each histogram bin represents a color in a suitable
color space (RGB etc) [3]. A distance between query
image histogram and a data image histogram can be
used to define similarity match between the two
distributions. To overcome problem with histogram
in 1995 Mehtre et al [4] proposed two new colormatching methods as “Distance Method” and
“Reference Color Table Method”, for image
retrieval. They used a coarse comparison of the color
histograms of the query and model images in the
Distance method they proposed.
Most colour histograms are very sparse and
thus sensitive to noise. In 1995 Stricker and Orengo
[5] proposed cumulated color histogram. Their
results are better than color histogram approach.
Observing the fact that the color histograms lack
information about how color is spatially distributed,
in 1997 Rui and Huang [6], introduced a new color
feature for image retrieval called color correlogram.
This feature characterized how the spatial correlation
of pairs of colour changes with distance in an image.
Usually, because the size of color correlogram is
quite large, the color autocorrlogram is often used
instead. This feature only captures spatial correlation
between identical colors.

The main contributions of this paper are as
follows. Here we have proposed a wavelet-based
approach for content-based image retrieval. Also
histograms are used for color feature extraction for
CBIR, and these color and texture features are
combined to improve the retrieval efficiency.
The main title (on the first page) should begin
1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of the page,
centered, and in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles,
coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the
title begins with such a word). Leave two 12-point
blank lines after the title.

The STFT represents a sort of compromise
between the time- and frequency-based views of a
signal. It provides some information about both
when and at what frequencies a signal event occurs.
However, one can only obtain this information with
limited precision, and that precision is determined by
the size of the window. But many signals require a
more flexible approach where we can vary the
window size to determine more accurately either
time or frequency. Wavelet analysis is such an
approach in which window with variable-sized
regions is used. Wavelet analysis allows the use of
long time intervals where we want more precise lowfrequency information, and shorter regions where we
want high-frequency information. However it is a
time-frequency region, but rather a time scale.

3.1. The Discrete Wavelet Transform
Calculating wavelet coefficients at every
possible scale is a fair amount of work, and it
generates an awful lot of data. That is why we
choose only a subset of scales and positions at
which to make our calculations. It turns out, rather
remarkably, that if we choose scales and positions
based on powers of two so-called dyadic scales and
positions then our analysis will be much more
efficient and just as accurate. We obtain such an
analysis from the discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) given by equation 1.

processing community as a two-channel sub band
coder. This very practical filtering algorithm yields
a fast wavelet transform a box into which a signal
passes, and out of which wavelet coefficients
quickly emerge. Let’s examine this in more depth.

An efficient way to implement this scheme
using filters was developed in 1988. This algorithm
is in fact a classical scheme known in the signal

4. Proposed method
The novel method which gives better retrieval
performance is discussed below.

4.1. Image database
The database used in the experimentation
consists of 40 different color textures from VisTex
image database. Size of each color database is 512 x
512 x 3. Each 512 x 512 x 3 images is divided into
sixteen 128 x 128 x 3 non-overlaping sub images,
thus creating a database of 640 patterns in the
database.

The database of 640 color texture images was
analyzed using standard wavelet, histograms and
combination of both. We have extracted texture
features using Standard Wavelets. As every colour
has its own importance in an image we have used the
features extracted from all the three-colour planes
(that is RGB planes) of an image. We have used
three level decomposition of each plane. To calculate
the feature vector we have first level energy (given
by equation 4) and computed standard deviation
(given by equation 5) of each sub-band. Thus the
coloured texture feature vector size of database is of
640 x 72 and for query image is 1 x 72. First level
energy is computed by the equation 4.

4.3. Similarity measure
A query pattern is any one of 640 patterns from
image database. This pattern is processed to compute
features with standard wavelet and histograms on
color bands. Then Euclidean distance metric given
by equation 6 is used to compute the similarity or
match value for given pair of images.

6. Conclusions
After the absolute analysis of the results
obtained by each method following conclusions can
be drawn. When only colour is considered as
retrieval parameter in CBIR gives only 62.5% of
average retrieval efficiency. Similarly when only
texture features are considered as retrieval parameter
there is not much improvement in the retrieval
efficiency. The average retrieval efficiency obtained
by this method is only 68.75%. Which shows that
only texture features or only colour features are not
sufficient to describe an image. But there is
considerable increase in retrieval efficiency when
both colour and texture features are combined for
CBIR. The average percent retrieval efficiency has
increased up to 75%. Thus it is rightly said in [1] that
only colour or only texture cannot differentiate a
cheetah and a tiger.

5. Experimental results
Comparison of average retrieval accuracy for
640 different colored textures using histograms,
conventional Standard wavelet and their combination
is provided in figure1. When Tile 10.bmp is given as
query and retrieved using three different methods of
retrieval used, in this paper following results were
obtained. The results obtained by both the texture
features and colour features consideration the
retrieval efficiency is 82% that is fourteen images
retrieved from the database are of same texture and
colour contents. Red, Green and blue curves in
figure 1 indicates the average retrieval efficiency
