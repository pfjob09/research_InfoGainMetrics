Abstract
This paper proposed a new approach for collecting,
analyzing and visualizing co-authoring data of
individuals. This approach can be used for
understanding the academic collaboration and
knowledge domain of individual researchers in a past
period through repetitive co-published works.
Particularly we extracted the co-authoring data from the
DBLP which is one of the largest on-line Computer
Science bibliographic databases available on the
Internet. To help users to understand the academic
collaboration and knowledge domain of individuals, we
developed an InterRing visualizer which shows not only
the weight of co-authorship of an individual with other
researchers in particular academic year, but also the
knowledge domain of the individual that was covered by
his/her publications published in a past period.

1. Introduction
The social network [7] analysis of co-authorship
attracts considerable interest and becoming paramount
due to exponential growth of published information in
science since last decade. A cutting edge research finding
in most cases is based on the cooperation of scientists
within research domain and has long been realized that
the coauthorship of articles in learned journals provides a
window on patterns of collaboration among the academic
community. Co-authorship of a paper can be thought of
as documenting collaboration between two or more
authors, and these collaborations form a “co-authorship
network” [6]. Such network reveals the persistent
cohesive research collaboration and clustering in the
network represents a knowledge domain. Furthermore,
the analysis of co-authorship of academic publications
could also help to create the Research Quality
Framework (RQF) for assessing the research quality of
individuals and research groups. Joint authorship often
reflects the joint research and the movement of an
individual author’s research domain.

Co-authorship has been well-studied [1, 6, 8, 9] that
reflecting the co-contributions of researchers working
towards an academic published paper. Many of these
studies used information visualization technique to
enhance the cognition process. Figure.1 shows a typical
visualization of co-authorship network [2]. In general
perspective, it visualizes the dataset in such a way that it
approximates the most influential researchers in research
domains and their interrelationships among their coauthors. Nevertheless, visualizing co-authorship in a
network with nodes representing authors and edges stand
for research proximity is a narrow definition for
scientific collaboration.
However, most of visualization techniques in
bibliography analysis usually use a plain graph of
network to present dataset. Each clustering in the
network does not exist in isolation; node of such network
represents an author and link directly connected to each
other if relationship between them can be coupled.
Unfortunately, this approach explains general sense of
information and did not preserve historical research
collaboration as oppose to our technique which details
the analyzed author’s scientific collaboration and
contribution with particular authors as well as inactive
authors in the past which possibly suggests the new
research community by repetitive published works on a
research domain. Furthermore, the network based
technique is difficult to work on very large dataset
eventually the large collection of nodes will occupy the
entire display space with overlapped edges that is
difficult to interpret the result.
Our primary scope in this research is focusing on the
analysis and visualization of individual’s co-authorship
network by applying InterRing visualization. We attempt
to visualize the academic collaborations and knowledge
domain of individual researchers. Our integrated
visualizer can show not only the weights of coauthorship of an individual with other researchers in
particular publication periods, but also the knowledge
domain of the individual that was covered by his/her
publications published in a past period. In general, the
InterRing visualizes the contributions of co-authors to an
analyzed author’s past research publications which also

can be further extended to explore the knowledge
domain and discovery between research communities.

of domains and still remains quite dependent on manual
process of data entry. Hence, for some domains it is
likely that only partial picture can be drawn.
A summary of statistics of DBLP studied is given in
Table.1 which is obviously has highlighted our concern
as addressed in Section.1. On average, there were 3.67
authors participated in a paper and each represents a
knowledge in a subject domain. Regardless of the
contribution of each author the knowledge has
exchanged more or less and the frequencies of
collaboration determine the well formed research
communities.
Figure.2 illustrates that the information on the
number of publications collected by DBLP has grown
exponentially since 1980 which also indicates the
explosion of knowledge and the need to understand the
contemporary scientific researches.

2. Co-Authorship Data Analysis
The dataset used for analyzing and visualizing coauthorship were ported from the on-line DBLP
(http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/), which is
one of the largest Computer Sciences bibliographic data
source available on the Internet. It provides information
on major computing journals and conference proceedings
between year 1936 and 2006. The distinctive advantage
of DBLP over another scientific bibliographic database
such as CiteSeer is the easily identification of authors.
DBLP provides full author names in a publication and
CiteSeer uses only the initial of authors which will often
cause confusions when multiple result-set has been
returned when querying on an author name and also
performing insert operation to the database that violates
the constraints. Thus, the decision was made to use
DBLP as our preference of dataset.
The DBLP engine relies on manual data entry
process by original authors or DBLP people whereas
CiteSeer uses a collection of URLs that each contains
resources of academic papers and actively attempts to
retrieve them from these sites on a regular basis. In
comparison DBLP is, however, restricted to a limited set

3. Visualization of Co-Authorship
The advantage of using InterRing to visualize coauthorship instead of network visualization is substantial.
We aim to understand the academic collaboration and
knowledge domain of individual researchers through the
visual representation of co-authoring relationships.
The visualization tool we have developed accepts
the name of researcher as a query to extract the coauthoring data from the DBLP dataset consisting of a list
of co-authors of joint publications published in certain
past years.
The InterRing visualizer will display the outcomes
of analyzed author and presenting in a series of
concentric rings. In our implementation, each ring
represents a particular publication year. From an
algorithmic point of view it is often desirable to deal
with a small research domain of analyst’s current interest
rather than the entire research domains. The InterRing
adds an extra dimension to the traditional network
representation that can be used to project the important
feature, such as historical data of the co-authorship.

3.1 Calculation of Individual’s Weight
Co-authoring is a common practice in Computer
Science. There is no established convention regarding
the significance of contribution required to merit and
being listed as co-author. Presumably, every author of a
joint paper should have made substantial contribution
and hence made it difficult to establish a standard of
fairness and significance. However, it is customary and
based on convention that a researcher produces key ideas
and prepares the manuscript certainly deserves to be
listed as first author, the remaining co-authors are listed
in order of contribution according to their consensus
which indicates that ordering is one of approaches to
determine the significance that we have used in order to
allocate the weight of an author for a year that they have
co-published works.
Suppose that there are n co-authors a1, a2…, an listed
in numerical order in a joint publication p and c(ai ) is the
contribution made by ai to the publication p. We assume
that c(p)=100 is the total contribution made by all coauthors; q is a deduction of contribution between two
authors (note that in our implementation we set q=2/3)
We have c (ai +1 ) = c (ai ) × q and the first author’s
contribution is c (a1 ) = c ( p) × q Thus, the total
contribution of publication p can be expressed as
n

c(p)=

¦ c(a ) = c(a ) + c(a ) + ... + c(a )
i

n

i =1

= c (a1 ) × (1 + q + q 2 + q 3 + ... + q n −1 )

Therefore, we have
c (a1 ) = c ÷ (1 + q + q 2 + q 3 + ... + q n −1 ) ; and since
c (ai ) = c (a1 ) × q i −1 ,

c (ai ) = (c × q i −1 ) (1 + q + q 2 + ... + q n −1 )
= (c × q i −1 ) [(1 − q n ) (1 − q )]
= [c × (1 − q) × q i −1 )] (1 − q n )

Since we set c=100 and q=2/3. Thus, we can get

The InterRing consists of a series of concentric
circles C1, C2, … Ck and each circle represents a certain
academic year. An InterRing ri is defined as a circular
region between circles Ci and Ci+1. We partition each
ring ri into n pieces (or Sectors) s1, s2, … sn and assign
them to n corresponding co-authors who made
contributions of joint publication to a certain academic
year. The higher the contribution an author made, the
larger the sector he will occupy. The layout of each ring
r was drawn from outer to inner with starting point at
zero degree displayed in an overlapped manner in the
same screen space.
The size of the Sector of a co-author occupied in a
ring is derived from the wedge wg(ai )={Cj, Cj+1, ș},
where j is the year of publication and ș is the angle
assigned to co-author ai. The angle ș is the function of
the contribution w(ai ) made by ai in an academic year
and can be calculated as below
ș = w(ai ) x 2ʌ

Thus, we can calculate the contribution of a particular
co-author ai to the joint publication p by using the
following formula:

c (ai ) =

Suppose that we are going to count a set of m papers
Pm = {p1, p2, …pm} as the contribution of a particular
academic year, and in that year an individual co-author ai
wrote only k papers {p(ai )1, p(ai )2, …p(ai )k} = Pk, with
other co-authors, where k ≤ m and Pk ⊆ Pm .
If we denote c(pj) is the overall contribution made
by the paper pj and c(ai )j is the contribution made by the
author ai to the paper pj, then we can easily calculate the
weight (or contribution) of an individual in an academic
year, in terms of jointing research publications.

Figure.3 illustrates the calculation of wedges and the
partitioning of Sectors to represent the research
contribution of each individual researcher.
Figure.4 shows the InterRing visualization of coauthoring data of a researcher over a past period. Each
sector in a ring represents an co-author. In the legend
field each co-author has assigned a color for easier
identification. The circular rings clearly reveal the
academic collaboration and possible movement of
research domain. It answers the questions, such as:
 In which year, what researchers have
participated in his/her research publications,
 The strength of research collaboration between
two researchers over a past period,
 What knowledge domain covered by an
individual’s research in a past period through
the joint publications.

By applying the formula (1), we can easily calculate
the contribution of an author ai in a research paper in
percentage.

3.2 InterRing Visual Representation

4. An Example

We apply the traditional InterRing drawing method
to the ring R. We place each co-author ai ∈ A on one of
the concentric subring r1, r2,,…, rk. if ai has joint
publications with current analyzed researcher. The
algorithm we used for drawing is stated below

In this section we will give an example of how to
use our InterRing to represent the co-authorship and
knowledge domain of an individual researcher through
the exploration of DBLP. In section.3 we have discussed
how to determine the contribution made by a co-author
to a publication p and how to calculate the overall weight
of a co-author in relation to a particular researcher of
joint publications.
For example, Figure.4 shows the analysis result of a
selected researcher Dr. M.L Huang for his co-authoring
relationships with other 22 researchers in the past 10
years. We can see from the InterRing in Figure 4 that
each co-author of Dr. Huang occupies a certain Sector
region in a sub-ring ri corresponding to a particular
academic year. We use different colors to help viewers to
distinguish sections. The size of a sector indicates the
strength of co-authoring relationship between a co-author
and the analyzed researcher and the overall contribution
made by that co-author in a academic year.
The visualization result clearly tells the user what
researchers in which academic year have participated and
made contribution in the joint research projects and
publications.
The interpretation of the InterRing can also indicate
the movement of a researcher’s knowledge domain
through her/his research collaboration history in a past
period. Therefore, the trend of knowledge movement of a
researcher could then be possibly predicted by further
exploration of his co-authors’ specialties.
In addition, in order to explore the research
proximity, we could then identify the most recent active
co-author, such as Dr Q.V Nguyen by identifying the
strongest co-authorship in outer rings. For example,
according to Figure.4, Dr. Nguyen has made significant
contribution in co-authoring with Dr. Huang since 2002.

Algorithm DrawInterRing (R, į) {
Iterator itr = R.getYears();
radius = į * itr.length;
While(itr.hasnext()) {
SubRing r = (SubRing)itr.next();
DrawSubRing(r, 0, radius);
radius = radius - į;
}
}
Algorithm DrawSubRing (r, Į, radius) {
Iterator itr = r.getAuthors();
While(itr.hasnext()) {
Author a = (Author)itr.next();
w(Į) = a.getWeight();
ș = w(a) * 2ʌ;
x1 = radius*cos Į; y1 = radius*sin Į;
x2 = radius*cos Į + ș; y2 = radius*sin Į + ș;
// Draw a sector based on [x1, y1] and [x2, y2]
Į = Į + ș;
}
}
}
Where į is a distance constant between two
concentric circles that is defined by width of display
space divided by number of academic years. We call the
procedure DrawSubRing(r, 0, radius) to draw a sequence
of sub-rings corresponding to the academic years of
analysis. The radius is the distance from a circle to the
center and the value of radius is decremented by į until
the last sub-ring is drawn. The Į is an initial degree at the
starting point of drawing a sub-ring, and will be
incremented by drawing sector by sector, see Figure 3.

Figure.5 shows the analysis result of Dr. Nguyen. In
comparison with Figure.4, This InterRing shows a strong
research coherence, high frequency of repetitive
collaboration and the establishment of small research
community on a similar knowledge domain that has
gradually formed since 2002. However, the existence of
unexplored research communities can be discovered
through the same process.
Figure.6 shows the details the co-authored papers
published in a past period between analyzed author and
particular co-authors. By analyzing of the past work, the
user can understand the common research strength,
knowledge sharing and the movement of knowledge
domain between co-authors.

Figure7 shows the integrated visualization of coauthoring relationship; while the InterRing is used to
show the co-authoring relational structure, the open
textual windows display the detail of joint publications

user.

The primary aim of this research is to visualize the
co-authorship relationship and contribution distribution
of joint papers that towards the visualization of the entire
knowledge and research domain of a particular
researcher in the past years. In our future work, as
fundamental aspect of knowledge discovery is capturing
the knowledge created by researchers and their coauthors.
Also, the model of visualization tool that we have
initially developed has capability to be extensible in
order to support for adding 1) algorithms 2) graphs and 3)
various datasets.
We will attempt to integrate the various layout
algorithms such as radial and spring drawings for future
knowledge domain visualization into our tool. These
layout algorithms help to easily present clustering data
across knowledge domains. In fact, our interring drawing
is more effectively in presenting the multi-dimensions
information.
In conclusion this paper has presented a new
approach to the analysis of co-authorship network via
interring drawing instead of traditional network
approach. The developed methodology is able to capture
the past scientific collaboration of analyzed author which
will not be otherwise visualized in traditional network.
We have also discussed the process to identify the
research community which is concluded via the
comparison of visualization results. The visualized result
can also be used to interpret the RQF that helps the
government and research organizations to determine the
funding based on research quality of a scientist through
scientific collaboration.
