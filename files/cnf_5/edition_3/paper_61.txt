greenhouse gases in two additional ways. Most aerosols are
highly reflective, they raise our planet‚Äôs albedo, thereby
cooling the surface and effectively offsetting greenhouse
gas warming by anywhere from 25% to 50% [1]. Particular
matter (PM), or aerosol, is the general term that was used
for a mixture of the solid particles and the liquid droplets
found in the atmosphere [2]. Particulate matter consists of
carbon and mineral bodies of different sizes, ranging in
diameter from 0.001 to 100 Pm. We are studying the
aerosols of size less than 10 micron. The smaller the
particles, the more the surface were they offer for other
pollutants to be absorbed. Therefore smaller particles
generally contain a higher amount of harmful compounds.
Besides that, the fine particles enter deeper into the
respiratory system where they are retained for a long time as
well as their higher amount of toxic components makes that
fine particles are of primary concern regarding health
impacts.
Nowadays, atmospheric pollution hampers human
breathing and impacts on life quality. Furthermore it
becomes a critical factor of anticipated deaths, which
concerns ambient air quality as well air quality in houses
and places of work [3]. Compared to ground measurements,
satellite imagery, due to their large spatial coverage and
reliable repeated measurements, provide another important
tool to monitor aerosols and their transport patterns [2].
In this study, a linear algorithm was used to
retrieval the PM10 measurements from SPOT data. Our
study was to investigate the potentiality of using satellite
thermal infrared data for air quality mapping. Several
studies have been shown the possible relationships between
satellite data and air pollution [4, 5].

Abstract
The effect of aerosols on the global climate system
is one of the major uncertainties of present climate
predictions. This study is dealing with obtaining
particulates matter of less than 10-micro in diameter
(PM10) using SPOT data. The objectives of this study is to
measure air quality parameters and to develop a model for
relating ground truth data to the remote sensing images
over Penang, Malaysia. In situ data of the PM10
measurements were collected simultaneously with the
digital images acquisition using a DustTrak meter. The sun
radiation measurements at the ground surface were
collected using a handheld spectroradiometer. The digital
images were separated into three bands namely red, green
and blue bands for multispectral algorithm calibration. The
selected parameter was particulate matter less than 10
micron (PM10). The digital numbers of the corresponding
in situ data were converted into irradiance and then
reflectance. The atmospheric reflectance values were
extracted from the satellite observation reflectance values
subtrated by the amount given by the surface reflectance.
The atmospheric reflectance values were later used for
PM10 mapping using the calibrated algorithm. The
relationship between the reflectance and the corresponding
air quality data was determined using regression analysis.
A new algorithm was developed for detecting air pollution
from the digital images chosen based on the highest
correlation coefficient, R and lowest root mean square
error, RMS for PM10. The results show that the use of
remotely sensed data produced better spatial resolution air
quality map compared to the spacing between ground
stations.

2. Study Area
The study area is the Penang Island, Malaysia
within latitudes 5o 12‚Äô N to 5o 30‚Äô N and longitudes 100o 09‚Äô
E to 100o 26‚Äô E. The map of the region is shown in Figure 1.
The satellite image was acquired on 31 January 2006. The
corresponding PM10 measurements were collected
simultaneously during the satellite overpass.

1. Introduction
Environmental pollution is the major concern
nowadays because all our daily activities are related to the
environmental. Recently many air quality studies using
satellite data have been done using MODIS data. In this
study, data from satellite SPOT 5 was used for this purpose.
The effects of aerosol on climate differ from those of

We assume that the atmospheric reflectance due to particle,
Ra, is also linear with the ƒ≤a [7], [8]. This assumption is
reasonable because [4] also found the linear relationship
between both aerosol and molecule scattering.

Equations (6) are substituted into equation (4). The result
was extended to a three bands algorithm as equation (7)
Form the equation; we found that PM10 was
linearly related to the reflectance for band 1 and band 2.
This algorithm was generated based on the linear
relationship between ƒ≤ and reflectance. Other Researcher
also found that the PM10 was linearly related to the ƒ≤ and
the correlation coefficient for linear was better that
exponential in their study (overall) [11]. This means that
reflectance was linear with the PM10. In order to simplify
the data processing, the air quality concentration was used
in our analysis instead of using density, »°, values.

achieved the correlation coefficient of about 0.91 as shown

4. Data Analysis and Results
SPOT satellite data was selected corresponding to
the ground truth measurements of the pollution levels. The
PCI Geomatica version 9.1 image processing software was
used in all the analyses. The images were rectified using the
second order polynomial coordinates transformation to
relate ground control points (GCP) in the map to their
equivalent row and column positions in the SPOT scene.
The DNs were extracted corresponding to the in situ data
locations for regression analysis. The DN values used in this
study were smoothed using an average filter of 3 by 3
window size.
Over a simple black target, the observed atmospheric
reflectance, is the sum of reflectance of aerosols and
Rayleigh contributions (Equation 9). This simplification,
however, is not valid at short wavelengths (less than 0.45
»ùm) or large sun and view zenith angles [12]. In this study,
a simple form of the equation (9) was used in this study
(Equation 10). This equation also used by other research in
their study [13].

where:
Rs

Rr

Ratm = reflectance from atmospheric components

T

It should be noted that the relfectance values at the
top of atmospheric is the sum of the surface reflectance and
atmospheric relfectance. The signals measured in each of
these visible bands represent a combination of surface and
atmospheric effects, usually in different proportions
depending on the condition of the atmosphere. Therefore, it
is required to determine the surface contribution from the
total reflectance received at the sensor. The surface
reflectance was retrieved using ATCOR2 in the PCI
geomatica 9.1 image processing software. The reflectance
measured from the satellite [reflectance at the top of
atmospheric, U(TOA)] was subtracted by the amount given
by the surface reflectance to obtain the atmospheric
reflectance. And then the atmospheric reflectance was
related to the PM10 using the regression algorithm analysis.
In this study, SPOT signals were used as
independent variables in our calibration regression analysis.

5. Conclusion
The developed algorithm produced high R and low
RMS values. A strong correlation (R = 0.90) was found
between the measured and the estimated PM10 values in
this study. This study indicates that satellite observation can
be used for air quality mapping using SPOT data. The use
of remotely sensed data produced better spatial resolution
air quality map compared to the spacing between ground
stations. Further study will be carried out to verify the
results and a multi regression algorithm will be developed
and used in the analysis.
