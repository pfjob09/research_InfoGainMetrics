Abstract

A method to construct transition curves using a
family of the quartic Bezier spiral is described. The
transition curves discussed are S-shape and C-shape of
G 2 contact, between two separated circles. A spiral is a
curve of monotone increasing or monotone decreasing
curvature of one sign. Thus, a spiral cannot have an
inflection point or curvature extreme. The family of
quartic Bezier spiral form which is introduced has more
degrees of freedom and will give a better approximation.
It is proved that the methods of constructing transition
curves can be simplified by the transformation process
and the ratio of two radii has no restriction, which
extends the application area, and it gives a family of
transition curves that allow more flexible curve designs.

1. Introduction
In various fields of Computer Aided Geometric
Design (CAGD) one of the interests lies in constructing
curves and surfaces that satisfy aesthetic requirements.
Fairness, or smoothness is an important entity of curve
and surface, it is often termed as geometric continuity,
G k or parametric continuity, C k . A generally accepted
mathematical criterion for a curve to be fair is that it
should have as few curvature extrema as possible. It is
desirable that the curvature extreme occur only where the
designer wants them [1].
G 2 Transition curves of two separated circles,
composed of the single segment or a pair of spiral
segments are useful for several Computer Graphics and
CAD applications. The practical application are e.g., in
highway design, railway route, satellite path, robot
trajectories, or aesthetic applications [2]. The importance
of this design feature is discussed in [3,4]. Spirals have
several advantages of containing neither inflection
points, singularities and nor curvature extrema. Such
curves are suitable for the transition curve between two
circles. One of the significant approaches to achieve the
transition curve of monotone curvature of constant sign
is by using parametric polynomial representation.

One of the most important mathematical
representations of curves and surfaces used in computer
graphics and CAD is Bezier curves. Their popularity is
due to the fact that, they possess a number of
mathematical properties which enable their manipulation
and analysis [5]. Cubic curves form provide a greater
range of shapes that allow the curve to have cusps, loops,
and up to two inflection points. This flexibility makes it
suitable for the composition of G 2 blending curves.
Unfortunately their fairness is not guaranteed [8].
Walton and Meek [6,7] have considered a pair of cubic
Bezier spiral segment and a planar Pythagorean
hodograph quintic spiral forms to blend transition curves
of joining circular arcs and straight line segment, to
produces fair curves. Five cases of G 2 transition curve
have been discussed. More improvement is shown in
[10], by increasing the degree of freedom of cubic Bezier
spiral. Habib and Sakai [2] have also considered a cubic
Bezier spiral and suggested a scheme to better
smoothness and more degree of freedoms.
This paper introduces a planar quartic Bezier spiral
and proposes a method to construct G 2 transition curves
between two separated circles by composing a pair of
spiral segment. We have discussed S-shape and C-shape
transition. Using quartic instead of cubic means more
degrees of freedom. We exploit the extra degrees of
freedom to gain the family of transition curves. Although
it involves a long and abstruse mathematical
manipulation, the use of symbolic manipulator will be of
a great help. This quartic Bezier spiral forms contain
neither inflection points, singularities nor curvature
extrema. Transition curves can be generated for any two
given circles, in other words, it has no limitation on the
ratio of two given radii. Also, we introduced a method to
find the point of connecting the two spirals that gives a
fair G 2 transition. A G 2 point of contact of two curves
is a point where the two curves meet and where their unit
tangent vectors as well as their curvatures are matched.
We will derive the necessary condition and constrains for
composing a spiral and also provide some numerical
examples to support the theoretical results.

The remaining part of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 gives a brief discussion of
background, notation and convention. We derivate the
quartic Bezier spiral in Section 3. In Section 4, a result of
transition curves between a point and a circle is
presented. Our main result is shown in Section 5. Some
numerical examples are showed in Section 6.

2. Preliminaries
The following notation and conventions are used.
We consider the dot product of two vectors, A and B is
given as A • B . The notation of A × B represents the
outer product of two plane vectors A and B . Note: the
dot and outer product results are A • B = A B Cosθ

Theorem 1
Given a beginning point, B0 , and two unit tangent
vectors T0 and T1 at beginning and ending points,
respectively. Denoted θ as the anti-clockwise angle

from T0 to T1 . And ending curvature value given as ,
r
it is assumed that the centre of the circle of curvature at
ending point is to the left of the direction of T1 and in
positive value, i.e., r > 0 . If the control points are given
as

this paper we denoted R (t ) as quartic curve. If T is the
unit tangent vector to R (t ) at t , it is denoted as
T = R (t ) / R ( t ) and T = 1 . The unit normal vector N

to R (t ) at t is perpendicular to T and the angle
measured anti-clockwise from T is π / 2 . The signed
curvature of a plane curve R(t) is
R '(t ) × R "(t )
(1)
κ (t ) =

R '(t )
The signed radius is the reciprocal of (1). It is known that
κ (t ) is a positive sign when the curve segment bends to
left and it is negative sign if it bends to right at t. If R '(t )
and R ''(t ) are first and second derivation of R (t ) ,
differencing of (1) yields

κ '(t ) =

Then R ( t ) as given by Eq. (4) and (5) is a spiral.
See Appendix 1 for proof.
This quartic Bezier spiral has the following
properties;

Observe that the standard quartic Bezier has ten
degrees of freedom. Whereby the quartic Bezier spiral
has seven degrees of freedom: one for each of θ , r ,α 0
and two of T0 , B0 . The value ρ0 is fixed, ρ1 is
depending on α 0 and ρ0 . And T1 had been controlled by
θ and T0 .

4. A transition curve between a point and a
circle
The following are the construction of a transition
curve between a point and a circle whereby the result is
useful for subsequent sections. There are two possible

point. Fig.1 shows an example of a transition curve

between a point and a circle, where κ (1) = , r > 0 . We

result can be obtained for the other one.

vectors of T0 and T1 , respectively. By convention, the
unit normal vector at R (t ) are on the left side of the
tangent at R (t ) .

The following theorem provides the necessary

Substitution of (9-10) into (13) and by using ρ0 , ρ1 from
Theorem 1, such that the points of contact are G 2 . And
A, r , θ , α 0 satisfies

and θ is

the turning angle from T0 to T1 . If A ≥ r , then a point
and a circle can be joined by a quartic Bezier spiral with
G 2 contacts on circle.

5. A transition curve between two separated
circles
In these cases, we used a pair of the quartic
Bezier spiral as stated in Theorem 1, denoted by R0 ( t )
and R1 ( t ) . With assumption that these segments make a
contact

on

circles

at

Ω0 , Ω1

at

R0 (1) , R1 (1) ,

respectively. C0 and C1 are centre of the circles, with
radii r0 and r1 . Our interest is to construct a fair
transition curve that satisfies following criterion; First,
both of the spirals are connected at t = 0 with zero
curvature, i.e., κ 0 (0) = κ1 (0) = 0 . Second, both the
spirals Ri (t ) , i = 0,1 have the same turning angle, θ .
Our focus is to have two spirals that are alike, even
though it is different in size and position. Therefore,
precise beginning point B0 is required. It is shown that
the coordinate of B0 depends on the ratio of the two
separated circle and the distance between them.
Referring to S-shape, B0 is taken as a point
interpolated by line segment C0C1 and its position is
determined by the ratio of the two circles,

B0 =

r0C1 + rC
1 0
. In the case of C-shape, B0 is taken as
r0 + r1

a point that satisfies

C0 − B0
r
= 0 , and C0 B0C1 is not
C1 − B0
r1

collinear. To draw the complete transition curve, two
methods have been suggested. First, generate both R0 ( t )
and R1 ( t ) separately. Second, generate either R0 ( t ) or

R1 ( t ) and then by doing the transformation process i.e.,
translation, rigid rotation or reflection, and uniform
scaling over one spiral to gain the other spiral. Such
transformation will not change the numbers of curvature
extremum and their relative position [10].
Observe that there are two possible solutions for Cshape and S-shape. The analysis will focus on the curve
in each case where initial curvature is positive since the
opposite case can be defined analogously. Our
discussions are based upon Fig.2 and Fig.3.

5.1. S-shaped transition curve
Assuming this two segments meet together at
R0 ( 0 ) = R1 ( 0 ) when t = 0 . Our analysis starts with the
finding of equations of R0 ( t ) , R1 ( t ) when they meet
Ω0 , Ω1 , respectively, at t = 1 . Observe that both

curvature at the contact points are positive so r0 , r1 > 0 .
From Fig.1, this is defined as:
G0 − rN1 = a0T0 + b0T1
(15)
G1 − r1M 1 = a1F0 + b1F1
(16)
where N1 , M 1 are unit normal vector of T1 and F1 . And
ai , bi for i = 0,1 are as given in (9).

The result of squaring and summing the components in
the terms of T0 and N 0 from (6) is

The pair of quartic is obtained upon solving of (18).
Observe that the degrees of freedom of quartic Bezier
spiral have reduced to two, referring to α 0 and θ . Next
is to determine B0 , followed by T0 , T1 from components
of (17). Each value of θ has unique values of α 0 . We
illustrate it by: q (θ ,α 0 ) = ( r1 + r0 )

Theorem 3
Given two circles Ω0 , Ω1 centred C0 , C1 with radii
r0 , r1 > 0 . Let Gi = Ci − B0 , i = 0,1 . If r1 + r0 < C1 − C0 ,

then the two circles can be joined by a pair of quartic
Bezier spiral forming S-shaped curve such that all points
of contact are G 2 .

5.2. C-shaped transition curve
Analogous to the previous case, the two quartic
Bezier spirals for C-shape form are obtained by the
following scheme. From Fig.3, these segments meet
together at R0 ( 0 ) = R1 ( 0 ) and make a contact on circles
Ω0 , Ω1 at R0 (1) , R1 (1) , respectively when t = 1 . Observe

that the curvatures of contact points are in different sign,
r01 > 0 and r1 < 0 . Define R0 ( t ) and R1 ( t ) at t = 1 as

Figure 2: S-shape transition curve

According to first criteria, if R0 ( 0 ) = R1 ( 0 ) and

κ 0 (0) = κ1 (0) = 0 then F0 = −T0 . For second criteria, if
the two spirals had the same turning angle, θ , then
F1 = −T1 and M 1 = − N1 . Subtracting (1) from (3) gives
us
G1 − G0 = −(a1 + a0 )T0 − ( b1 + b0 ) T1 − (r1 + r0 ) N1
(17)

(8-10). According to the corresponding criteria, (16) can
therefore be written as
G1 − r1M 1 = −a1T0 − b1F1
(21)
Where
T0 • T1 = −T0 • F1 = Cosθ
T0 • N1 = −T0 • M 1 = − Sinθ
(22)
N 0 • T1 = N 0 • F1 = Sinθ
N 0 • N1 = N 0 • M 1 = Cosθ
Squaring and summing the result in terms of
coefficient of vectors T0 and N 0 from the difference
between with (20) and (15) , yields

at ( 20,0 ) , ( 0,0 ) with radius 5 and 2 units, respectively.
With α 0 = 0.32 , θ = 0.867967 we obtained
B0 = ( 4.956289, −3.723369 ) , T0 = ( 0.979901, −0.199486 ) ,

Conclusions

Figure 3: C-shape transition curve

The solution for the two quartic Bezier spiral that
form C-shaped is obtained by solving (22) for α 0 and θ .
This is followed by determining the beginning point B0
from (14), T0 , T1 from the difference between (20) and
(15). Hence, the following theorem defines the necessary
condition for forming C-shape transition curve. Let

It has been demonstrated that fair curves can be
designed interactively using quartic Bezier spirals. Since
this Bezier quartic also has NURBS representations,
curves designed using a combination of quadratic, cubic,
quartic spirals, circular arcs and the straight line segment
can be represented entirely by NURBS. This quartic
Bezier spiral is more flexible than cubic Bezier spiral in
general because it has seven degrees of freedom; this will
give a family of transition curves in either S-shape or Cshape forms and the spiral can be generated from two
arbitrary circles. The advantage of using this is the ratio
of two radii of separated circles has no restriction. By
using the precise beginning point for those spiral
segments as suggested. In this paper, we can also
simplify the computation through transformation
process.
