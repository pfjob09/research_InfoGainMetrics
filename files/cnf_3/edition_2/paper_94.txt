have a stroke each year [1]. Of these, a third of
are likely to die within the first 10 days, about
a third shows positive signs of improvement
within the first month and about a third suffers
from long term complications. A vast majority
of patients with post stroke complications
suffer from various motor and functional
deficits in their upper extremity (Krakauer
[54]). These neurological disorders hamper the
post stroke victim’s social life by limiting the
chances of carrying out the activities of daily
living and other functional tasks effectively.

Abstract
The existing techniques used for post stroke
rehabilitation have sought to offer stroke
survivors with upper extremity motor deficits a
system for the practice and re-learning of
motor tasks. Some studies suggest that the use
of Virtual Reality technologies as an assistive
technology in combination with conventional
therapies can achieve improved results in post
stroke rehabilitation. Despite the wealth of
ongoing research attempting to build a virtual
reality based system for upper extremity
rehabilitation, there still exists a need for a
training platform that would provide whole
arm rehabilitation. In order to be practical this
system should ideally be low cost and involve
minimal therapist involvement. This paper
describes some of the applications of virtual
reality that have undergone clinical trials with
patients suffering from upper extremity
functional motor deficits. A brief description of
VR technologies that are in place, providing
benefits to the stroke patients with upper
extremity motor and functional deficits,
alongside a proof of concept of a whole arm
rehabilitation platform is presented.

According to Dobkin [53], Isobel et al. [50]
and Yeh et al. [41], the motor and functional
deficits can slowly and gradually be improved
or recovered with organized and well planned
treatment modules, which include systematic
and repetitive task-oriented motor training.
Carr and Shephred [2] have illustrated that a
discrete
and
efficient
rehabilitative
environment can prove to be advantageous in
the recovery process. Virtual reality is a
technology which can address human physical,
cognitive and psychological retraining (Rizzo
et al. [49] and O'Brien [55]). It has been shown
to be an effective way of establishing a
variable and stimulating environment, allowing
the patient to engage in meaningful and
motivating therapeutic activities. Through
Virtual Reality (VR) real time motor
performance data can be obtained, which can
be used to control and adapt the training
environment to the individual needs of the
patient and collect patient performance data
(Sveistrup [3], Holden [4], Kuttuva et al. [5]
and Bardorfer et al. [42]).

1. Introduction
According to the Stroke association and the
British heart foundation; stroke is the third
biggest killer and the leading cause of
disability in the United Kingdom [1].
Statistical data suggests that the mortality rate
of stroke for men and women (under the age of
65) has reduced consistently since the 1970s
but there are still about 111,000 people who

2. VR in Rehabilitation
Using VR to create a three-dimensional
representation of the real world, it is possible
631
641

to present the user with a sense of immersion
in a world with familiar objects and / or events
[51]. Users interacting with the computer
simulation can freely maneuver in these
Virtual environments (VEs) in real time (Riva
[6], Riva [7], Kanbe et al. [8], Rose et al. [9],
Zhao et al. [10], Thompson et al. [11] and [51]).

generated virtual environment (Rothbaum et al.
[16] and [51]).
The concept of a non-immersive VR system,
which uses a desktop computer for the display
of the computer simulations, is the best suited
medium for home based post stroke
rehabilitation, as it occupies less space, is less
complicated and is less expensive to install and
use. Virtual Reality has several other
components that provide an interface of the
real world with the virtual objects or the
computer simulation. Some of the commonly
used interface devices are electromagnetic
sensors (which track limb position in the real
world), cyber gloves (which track hand and
finger position) and haptics devices such as
Phantom (Nikolakis et al. [48]), which could
track the position of the finger tip for
rehabilitation tasks [51]. Figure 1 shows the
basic processes and interfaces involved in
order to generate the VR environment and
interface the user input for real-time activities.

Virtual Reality can be non-immersive (Stone
[12]) or immersive (Sanchez-Vives and Slater
[13] and [51]). A computer screen displays a
non-immersive VR system [51]. In this case,
the user can interact with the environment
through external conventional means, such as
keyboards, mouse, VR gloves or joystick ([9]
and [51]). This non-immersive VR system is
also commonly referred to as a desktop VR
system. A projection or semi immersive VR
system is an extension of the desktop VR
system, where the desktop is replaced by a
large screen monitor, large screen projection
system, or multiple television projection
systems [51].

The use of an HMD (head mounted display), a
computer augmented virtual environment
(CAVE) or a large or multiple screen setup like
IMAX theatres constitutes a fully immersive
VR system (Cruz-Neira et al. [14], Bowman et
al. [15] and [51]). Overall, the immersive VR
approach uses the computer simulation, human
limb tracking devices such as motion sensors
or other trackers and the desktop or projection
displays as well as some other sensory input
devices, to present a participant in a computer

Since the early 90s virtual reality has been
used in the field of post stroke rehabilitation
and it has grown drastically ever since,
providing an assistive as well as an
independent means of rehabilitation for
patients with functional motor disabilities of
the upper extremity (Greenleaf and Tovar [17],
Kuhlen and Dohle [18], Rose [19] and
Hubbard et al. [50]). Apart from providing
exercise-related circumstances for people with

642
632

stringent motor disabilities (Kizony et al. [25]),
it is a promising tool to practice activities of
daily living with an individualised set of
virtual environments, such as virtual kitchens,
vending machines, a letter box and others
(Burdea, and Coiffet [20], Rand and Kizony
[21], Weiss et al. [22], Pareto et al. [23] and
O'Dell et al. [24]).

Broeren et al. [35]). In all the cases, before
beginning the clinical trials, traditional
assessment tests were conducted for different
motor impairments. These included the FuglMeyer tests for both mild to moderate ([27],
[28] and Piron et al. [36]) and moderate to
severe impairment ([26]). The list of the
assessment tests, conducted on patients with
the onset of the clinical trials using virtual
reality systems are described in Table 1.

As observed from the aforementioned work,
there has been a lot of research conducted to
evaluate and provide empirical evidence of the
effectiveness of virtual reality in post stroke
rehabilitation of upper extremity ([18], [19],
[25] and [50]).

The majority of the clinical trials focused on
some selection criteria for recruiting stroke
patients with motor abnormalities in the upper
extremity. For some of the trials, patients with
active extensions of the wrist above 20°,
metacarpophalanx extensions of fingers above
10° ([29], [30] and [31]), or elbow extension
against gravity [33], qualified for inclusion.
However, stroke survivors with astringent
cognitive or visuo-spatial impairment, neglect,
speech abnormalities, tremor, spasticity or
other neurological disorders marked as
constraints were not included in the clinical
trials with VR [33].

Some of the studies have used clinical trials
and other studies did not reach that stage.
Figure 2 shows several different applications
of VR as a rehabilitation tool.
2.1 VR Rehabilitation Practices
Most of the studies using the VR based
rehabilitation systems have used patients 6
months into the stroke rehabilitation process
(Holden et al. [26], Holden et al. [27], Piron et
al. [28], Boian et al. [29], Deutsch et al. [30],
Merians et al. [31], Broeren et al. [32] and Jang
et al. [33]). In a smaller number of studies the
patients were chosen in the acute phases of
stroke, i.e. 3 months post-stroke (Piron et al.
[34] and

After the initial assessment of the strength and
the agility of the shoulder, arm, hand and the
fingers, forming the inclusion and the
exclusion criteria, the clinical trials were
planned.

interact with the virtual world. Some of the
studies used the electromagnetic sensors as an
interface device to track upper limb position
and locate the virtual arm in the VE
accordingly ([26], [27], [28] and [36]). Other
studies ([29], [30], [31] and [37]) employed the
non-immersive VR approach with a computer
display for the hand function using a cyber
glove interface. Another category of studies
have used the semi-immersive systems ([32]
and [35]), along with the haptic devices for the
training of the motor deficit of patients in the
VE. Finally, very few studies have used fullyimmersive systems [33], this time paired with
the cyber glove interface. This is due to the
fact that these immersive systems require a
large projection screen for the display of the
VE, which can be prohibitively expensive.
There were varying tasks or a teacher
trajectory (a path to follow on the therapist’s
guidelines) that were charted out, depending
on the varying lesions affecting the upper
extremity, resulting in different functional
motor deficits ([26], [27], [28] and [36]). In
several studies, the patients needed to be made
aware or educated about the system prior to the
trials so as to carry out the training safely and
with ease.
Some of the most common tasks such as the
reach and grab, manipulation of virtual objects
plus pick and place were chosen for the
majority of the clinical trials. Later, it was
concluded that they provided an early boost in
the training of the rehabilitation tasks. The
time in reaching the goal position and the
speed with which the task at hand can be
completed has been one of the variables in the
measurement and training with the virtual
rehabilitation systems ([28], [32], [35] and
[36]). Some of the other measures, which were
collected in order to access the efficiency of
the training provided via virtual reality were
finger speed, fractionation, finger range of
motion and unnecessary or compensatory
movements (as demonstrated in [29], [30], [31]
and [32].
The sample size, duration and the repetitions of
the training varied for the set up of different
VR studies. Some studies ([32] and [36])
performed the training for a 45 minutes period,
whereas some studies ([27], [28], [33] and [36])
went on to a duration of 1 to 2.2 hours. To
establish an unvarying trend of learning in the
VE and its transfer onto the real world, some
studies required a retrial after 3 or 5 weeks
([28], [29], [30], [31], [33] and [36]) or 11-13
weeks at the rate of 5 times per week, such as
in [26] (or even more).

For the clinical trials, most of the studies used
their own built-in interfacing technique to

644

2.2 Evaluation and Outcomes

which could potentially be a highly effective
approach.

After the clinical trials, the patient-learned
tasks or the training have to be tested in the
real world to check on the improvements and
transfer of learning from the virtual world to
the real world (as detailed in Table 1). There
were several specific tests conducted before
and after the clinical trials in different studies;
such as the Fugl Meyer tests ([26], [27], [28]
and [36]), the pegboard tests, the dynamometer
force test ([26], [29], [30], [31], [32] and [33]),
the prude pegboard test ([26], [27], [29], [30]
and [31]), and for the measure of hand skills
the Jebson Test of Hand function ([26], [27],
[29], [30] and [31]).

4. Future Work
A system in early developed by the authors of
this paper is focusing on the development of a
full arm and hand rehabilitation system
(Prashun et al. [52]). The system would use the
motion sensors and a cyber glove as an
interface device with the VE. The position and
orientation of the upper limb can be derived
using the kinematics of the human arm
calculated from the orientation data from the
sensors and glove. Three MT9 sensors [38]
would be used to determine the orientation of
the shoulder, elbow and the trunk, whereas the
DG5-VHand glove [39] would be used to
determine the roll and pitch of the wrist along
with the finger flexion and extension.

Most of the studies have shown positive results
of using the virtual reality medium in post
stroke upper extremity rehabilitation ([28],
[29], [32] and [35]). It should however be
noted that there was a minority of experiments
returning results which showed poor recovery
([28] and [36]) or sometimes negligible
observed recovery [26], in some cases with
functional independence. After the successful
evaluation of the virtual tasks, the role of
games in the rehabilitation of the post stroke
patients has also been explored and shows that
the intervention presents promise in
occupational therapy with a fairly wideranging applicability (Broeren et al. [47]). It
should finally be noted that some isolated
studies have disapproved the unsupervised
training with rehabilitation systems at home
[23].

The overall system could be very promising to
the rehabilitation industry, since it tracks the
whole arm, hand and the fingers in 3dimensions, providing the user with the
flexibility and independence to train their
upper extremity at home.

3. Discussion and Conclusion
References

It has been seen that different virtual reality
based upper extremity systems are being used
for clinical trials. The studies suggest that
virtual reality has the potential to be effective
and a very promising tool in stroke
rehabilitation. It is proposed that the VR based
rehabilitation tool could be made more
intuitive,
entertaining,
effective,
less
complicated and home-based with even lower
cost. It has also be seen from the studies that
the empirical application of virtual reality for
the rehabilitation of hand, fingers, upper arm
and forearm individually has been shown to be
effective in many cases from experimental
results. It is finally also evident that there is
very little research that has covered the
rehabilitation of the whole arm and hand,
