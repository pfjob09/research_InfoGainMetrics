of a Weave Census instance, or application, illustrates how
built-in analytic support for functions such as normalization
meets the needs and demands of a variety of users. Weave
is evolving to meet user needs, and the next stages in the
development of Weave, which will allow improved access
to complex datasets such as the Census, will be discussed.
Weave is a platform that facilitates extensive user interaction with visualizations of Census data, including geographic and non-geographic visualizations, and its development trajectory seeks to expand capabilities for browsing
and searching this rich data source. Weave ”is a new webbased visualization platform designed to enable visualization
of any available data by anyone for any purpose. Weave
is an application development platform supporting multiple
levels of user proﬁciency novice to advanced as well as
the ability to integrate, disseminate and visualize data at
’nested’ levels of geography. Weave has been developed
at the Institute for Visualization and Perception Research
at the University of Massachusetts Lowell in partnership
with the Open Indicators Consortium (OIC), a national
collaborative of public and nonproﬁt organizations working
to improve access to more and higher quality data.” [5] [6]
Furthermore Weave is licensed as open source software with
concomitant rights and responsibilities and thereby avoids
common licensing restrictions on ﬂexible, user interactions
with public data.(The Weave core code is released under the
GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3), and the
Weave API under the Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0).)
Members of OIC experimented with pre-release versions
of Weave in the context of an ”agile development process”.
These experiments proved useful in pointing out anomalies,
patterns and errors when creating visualizations of a broad
range of measures and indicator data. [1] As a result,
Weave’s design includes runtime ﬂexibility and can alter
its look and feel to facilitate customized data presentations
which serve the needs of varied targeted audiences. [2]
The U. S. Census Bureau has recently replaced its decennial long-form questionnaire with an annual American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS data is reported annually
in one-year, three-year and ﬁve-year formats, with the ﬁveyear ACS providing the most detailed results, due to using

Abstract—Weave (Web-based Analysis and Visualization Environment) facilitates extensive real-time user interaction with
visualizations of US Census Bureau data, both geographic
and non-geographic. This paper discusses the complexities
of preparing a large complex data set for visualization in
the tool, and the potential advantages of engaging such data
visually. The required pre-processing of the American Community Survey (ACS) data serves as the prime example. The
procedure for loading detailed data into Weave is described.
Several examples of presenting and interactively manipulating
Census data are presented including analytics using R Project
supported statistics and how drawing upon Weave’s multigeolayering capabilities can support ﬂexibility in implementing
normalization options. The development trajectory for weave
seeks to expand capabilities for metadata insertion, browsing
and searching this rich data source.

DATA AND M ULTIPLE G EOLAYERS
The United States Census provides detailed and varied
data across multiple geographic levels (geolayers). Some
of these geolayers are nested (i.e. the geographies in one
layer ﬁt into the geographies of another layer without
overlapping) and others represent more idiosyncratic specialpurpose jurisdictional systems. Existing applications that
support public browser-based access to Census data typically
allow identiﬁcation by attribute or jurisdiction but not by
attribute value, and they provide limited ﬂexibility in custom grouping of jurisdictions by users for exploration and
comparison. Advanced users of census data may therefore
need to download a large amount of Census data and
analyze it themselves. The complexity of the structure of
the downloadable database provided on the Census websites,
and the lengthy, context-speciﬁc attribute descriptions create
signiﬁcant challenges for transforming and loading the data
and metadata into visualization systems. (Metadata refers
to explanatory material related to the data.) This paper
explains the methods and support features found in one
such visualization system, Weave (Web-based Analysis and
Visualization Environment), for implementing these transformations; it describes and illustrates the advantages of
Weave visualizations of Census data. One important use

identiﬁers that allow automatic parsing, grouping and recognition of speciﬁc data items and an absence of a tagging
mechanism or a way to carry out an automatic search of
related terms and tags.
Future development of Weave will be aimed at overcoming these barriers, but the ﬁrst step is to decide how to import
the ACS data and visualize it.

a larger sample size within a moving window that avoids
many of the conﬁdentiality and privacy issues that are innate
in the single-year survey. Advantages of the US Census as
a test case for building an enhanced, ﬂexible user interface
for public access to data are its great range of demographic
and socio-economic data, and the multiple levels and variety
of geographic jurisdictions. The ﬁrst step in creating the
Weave ACS application is to make its labeling and indexing
intuitively accessible and useful to human users.
Although it is a general data visualization system Weave
has strong built-in advantages in managing maps and
geospatial information that are linked to data. Some understanding of the strengths and limitations of how Weave,
Version 1.0, presents data and metadata to users will be
useful in describing the UI challenges of integrating a
complex census data base into the Weave project in such
a way that end-users ﬁnd it easy to navigate. The design of
a more general interface will be enhanced by the current and
future UI design process of the evolving Weave visualization
platform.
The ACS data base in its monolithic form can provide
a level of detail that few users would ﬁnd comprehensible,
but two ”reports” or extracts of the most commonly-accessed
data are generated by the Census Bureau with each release:
the ”Subject Tables” and the ”Proﬁles”, with the latter being
the most complete and well-structured. Preparing such a
visualization of the data requires data preparation time and
coding skills that the average internet user of the does not
possess. Once one such hierarchy has been accessed in a
structured way, the same process can be repeated to access
the data for other individual geographic units.
The important advantage of Weave access to US Census
data lies in the high level combination of performance and
interactivity that will support user selection and comparisons
across geospatial jurisdictions. This paper reports on the ﬁrst
stage implementation of a Weave US Census visualization
instance.

III. T HE A MERICAN C OMMUNITY S URVEY P ROFILES IN
W EAVE
As noted above, there are three major sets of tables that
are available for accessing the ACS 2006-2010 5-year data
base. These tables are related but vary in completeness,
in terms of attributes, geospatial coverage, and focus for
priority extraction of data. There are differences in both
attribute id and type of attributes, so that even when there is
close overlap there are distinctions that must be kept in mind.
Some data extracts available from earlier census releases
are compatible and therefore can serve as a baseline year
for limited number of jurisdictions which can be followed
for future changes, but these are discontinuous in that the
updates will not be available until subsequent 5-year reports.
[7]
The largest set of tables, with names beginning in ”B”,
contains the ”Detailed” data from which other reports are
generated by the US Census Bureau. These large ﬁles are
in a format designed to be processed by the statistical
package SAS. The Weave data team initially experimented
with loading the detailed ACS data: once SAS had been
used to export the data as comma-separated (.csv) ﬁles, the
Weave team carried out several experiments to determine
how much and what kind of effort would be needed to
put the detailed data into a format that can easily be
imported into and visualized in Weave. The multi-gigabyte
size of the Detailed dataset, together with the fact that its
hierarchical structure was not made formally explicit, made
the process of visualizing it, even at the county geographic
level, complex and labor-intensive, and much of the data
in the resulting Weave tables was too detailed to appeal to
non-specialists.
Also available from the Census Bureau are extracts of
the ”Microdata”, or raw unaggregated survey results, known
as ”Public Use Microdata”. These can be used to generate
custom tables, but would not be suitable for presentation in
Weave without extensive preprocessing.
The raw Detailed ACS data is also, as noted above,
preprocessed into two smaller bundles of statistics known
as ”Subject” tables, whose names begin with ”S” and
”Proﬁle” tables, whose names begin with ”DP”. Complete
data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year
Proﬁles is available on the World Wide Web via ftp or http
protocols and via the American Factﬁnder (AFF) website
(http://factﬁnder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml

II. M AKING THE ACS P ROFILE DATA ACCESSIBLE
The ACS is a treasure trove of information if it can only
be presented in a clear, uncluttered way, permitting the user
to search out the relevant material and combine it freely to
answer new questions. Sharleen Forbes concludes, ”..it is
clear that new data visualizations not only allow us to look
at currently existing data in new ways but also provide a
way for us to visually demonstrate statistical concepts.” [3]
Weave offers a way to unlock this treasure, but the
process of doing so requires overcoming of barriers to its
comprehension.
Barriers to creating user-friendly labeling and searching
of the data include jargon and abbreviations known only
to experts on the data, the lexicographic complexity of the
data’s labels and metadata, a lack of completely consistent

). This latter site provides access to the ACS Proﬁles in the
most suitable format for Weave visualizations.
Succeeding releases of the ACS Proﬁles and Subject tables are expected to maintain the same format. The structure
of the ACS 5-year ﬁles is comparable (but not identical) to
that of other census data releases over the last few decades,
including prior decennial census, with a few problematic
changes from time to time.
Weave is well suited to present ACS data because of its
strong orientation toward geographies. At a given geographic
level, Weave works best with a table where the rows represent geography and the columns represent attributes for
that geography (e.g. a table of demographics by county for
the US, or a table of population density by town within
Massachusetts).
To use these ﬁles in Weave, the data must be cleaned
and prepared and loaded into a database. The data is then
extracted into a visualization with automatically-generated
SQL queries against the dataset.

Figure 2.

The header rows are hierarchical in nature, with the
topmost row giving a serial number for the attribute and
succeeding rows giving increasingly speciﬁc categorical
information about the attribute. Columns are grouped in sets
of four with the same serial number, and the sixth row of
each column describes the type of information found in the
column (estimate, estimate margin of error, percent, percent
margin of error). In order for a user to understand what
the attribute refers to s/he must see the entire hierarchy of
descriptors in the ﬁrst six rows of the ﬁle. The ﬁrst three
columns of the ﬁle contain a ”geographic header” for the
geography being described, and all other columns contain
attribute data.
In most cases, the percent value is the most useful value
to return to the Weave interface, since percentages are easy
to compare, but the administrator might choose to list both
the raw estimate and the percent. The margins of error may
confuse some users of the data more than they enlighten
them, but they too can be included at the administrator’s
discretion. Margins of error are invaluable to expert users
of the data, who need to know exactly how reliable the
estimates are. In some cases, the percent ﬁeld is blank;
in some cases it contains a duplicate of the contents of
the ”estimate” ﬁeld. In these cases the administrator must
exercise judgment based on common sense or extraneous
knowledge of the data to decide how to label the values.
Although the hierarchical organization of most categories
is made explicit in the header rows, there are also some
attributes that are logically subordinate to the preceding
attribute (for example, ”households with one or more person
over 65 years old” might be a subset of the ”singleperson households” or of the ”family households” category,
depending on its location within the ﬁle); in these cases, the

IV. F ILE S TRUCTURE OF THE ACS DATA
The csv ﬁles downloaded from the AFF site include six
header rows describing the meaning of the attributes or
columns in the ﬁle, and each subsequent row (after the six
header rows) represents a geographic entity within a speciﬁc
geographic level (for example: a county within a state).

geographic map layer, Weave exhibits its powerful, ﬂexible
capabilities to visualize the facts found in the data base.
In Figure 2, the map, the color legend and histogram
are showing values related to the percent of the county
population that has educational attainment at the level of
high school or higher. The default binning on the color
legend and the histogram divides the range from lowest
to highest value into 10 equal segments. Binning can be
customized. The scatter plot of counties presents the percent
of the civilian population that is unemployed on the Y-axis
and the percent Hispanic or Latino on the X-axis. These
visualizations are only a few of the options selectable from
the tool menu of visualizations [8] but are sufﬁcient to
illustrate probing, selection and geolayering of ACS proﬁle
census data.
Figure 2 also shows the second lowest bin probed that

or Latino population of 50

V ISUALIZATIONS
For Weave administrators who create visualizations of
data, Weave provides a tool-set called the Administration
Console. The usual way of loading data into Weave’s backend database is to import csv ﬁles. When a csv ﬁle is
imported, Weave loads it into the SQL database and creates
a table deﬁnition. By default, the table deﬁnition consists
of one ﬁeld for each column header in the csv ﬁle, and the
names of these ﬁelds are taken verbatim from the column
headers. The import interface requires speciﬁcation of a key
ﬁeld that has unique values for each row in the data table. If
the data ﬁle is to be used in connection with a polygon map,
as are the ACS proﬁle tables, the ”key-type” of the records
must match that of the map layer with which it will be
joined. This default assumes that the csv ﬁle contains one
”record” or row for each geography (town, county, state,
etc.) in the layer. While the ACS ﬁles downloaded from
the AFF meet this criterion, the multiple header rows pose
a special problem which Weave has solved by providing
features that generate custom labels or hierarchical labels,
at the discretion of the administrator, from the header rows.
After Weave has generated the SQL queries to fetch the
data correctly, it may still be necessary for the administrator
to edit the generated columns names or hierarchy elements
to make them more human-readable, but the bulk of the
work has already been performed by Weave’s sophisticated
import functions An example of a data hierarchy can be seen
in Figure 1.
Once the data has been imported and associated with a

implemented these functions as a package in R statistical
programming language. This ”beta” stage effort ”deﬁnes
a new ’acs’ class object (containing estimates, standard
errors, and metadata for tables from the ACS), with methods
to deal appropriately with common tasks (e.g., combining
subgroups or geographies, mathematical operations on estimates, tests of signiﬁcance, plots of conﬁdence intervals,
etc.).” [4] Much of his work and that of other researchers
using open-source add-ins can be used to improve Weave’s
customization for ACS data in the future.

range of public data users. Given the nested geospatial nature
of much data, the user may wish to see data normalized
within any number of higher level jurisdictions. Starting at
the county level, the normalizations may be an attribute
measured as a percent compared to the state or national
value. For attributes measured as counts, normalization
might commonly be presented as a percentage of the state
or national counts.
Figure 5 shows several additional analytic support tools.
The scatter plot now has the percent with high school or
higher on the X-axis and a linear line as dawn by peer-topeer interaction with R-project software. It also shows the
window for the Equation Editor, another general analytic
support tool within Weave. The equation in Figure 5 is an
example drawing on Weave’s multi-geolayering capabilities
to illustrate the generation of normalized county values
relative to the United States national average for ”percent
high school graduate or higher”.
Figure 6 shows the redrawn visualizations with the normalized county values ranging from a low of 55
Figure 6 also illustrates the MapTool where the state
geolayer is checked as selectable while the county level is
de-selected. This ﬁgure illustrates state-level probing is now
active, For instance probing Montana shows that 90.4
In combination with the equation editor, state values can
be normalized relative to national values and county values
can be normalized relative to state values. The current
version of Weave demonstrates the feasibility of supporting user-selected, variable boundary deﬁned regions from
contiguous or non-contiguous jurisdictions and related userdeﬁned aggregation basis for normalization.
Recently Ezra Glenn has worked with local-level planners
engaged with community groups to identify the most common problems associated with using ACS data that require
statistical techniques. Working with this group, Glenn has

VII. D EVELOPMENT D IRECTIONS : M ETADATA ,
S EARCHING AND B ROWSING
Currently, the csv import process does not require mandatory or automated metadata insertion. The administrator is
urged to insert three ”Dublin Core” descriptive ﬁelds of
metadata describing the table as a whole (title, subject,
and description). Inserting the metadata is not mandatory.
It is possible to go back and insert metadata at a later
time, although practically it may be more difﬁcult to track
down metadata if not included upon initial data importation.
As yet, there is no provision for inserting metadata about
individual attributes deﬁned in the table which will be
increasingly important in linking ACS attributes to attributes
drawn from other data sources.
The user interface of Weave version 1.0 permitted freetext search of the contents of either the left or right column
of the table-selection and attribute-selection displays, but
that was the extent of the initial search functionality within
Weave. If, for example, one was interested in ”self-employed
workers”, searching for that string turned up no results,
although there is data on related subjects in the dataset
whose title does not include those exact words. Enhanced
search capabilities, with the ability to search metadata and
tags as well as titles, need to be designed for Weave.

623

In Weave 1.0, it was a labor-intensive task for an administrator to create a selection hierarchy in a Weave instance. For
this reason, many Weave visualizations have been released
without a hierarchical attribute selector, and end-users are
often hard-pressed to locate the attributes of interest in a
long, arbitrarily-ordered list. In the case of the ACS, this
list may contain hundreds of entries. Enhanced support for
creating and maintaining hierarchical user-friendly selection
lists is a high priority for future Weave development.
As noted above, normalization is a powerful tool, much
in demand among those who need to present census data
visually in support of analysis. Weave’s capabilities in this
area are robust, but there is a need for an intuitive user
interface for establishing a base for normalization. Weave
holds out the promise of normalization of ACS data from any
particular geography against an arbitrary user-deﬁned geography (for example, the ”ﬁve-county area”, or ”the top-ﬁve
metropolitan regions”) in addition to standard geographic
base regions such as the US or the state. Implementing this
functionality will require evaluating the relative merits of
using the R statistical package and the equation editor.

VIII. C ONCLUSION
This paper brieﬂy describes the process by which census
data can be processed, analyzed, visualized and explored
in Weave. Design decisions made certain tasks in Weave
simple and others more complex to achieve. The design
team, with its Agile development process, listened to user
feedback and made incrementally improved interfaces to
those tasks that were in most demand among users. The key
goal was to provide a tool that can load and analyze data, and
in this example, Census data, and produce an informative
and engaging visualization, quickly and with minimal effort.
Weave is available at iWeave.org.
