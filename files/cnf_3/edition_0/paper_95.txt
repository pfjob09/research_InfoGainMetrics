The ways in which we reinterpret and personalize
spaces effectively convey important information about
our emotional states, working methodologies,
knowledge, skills, cultural backgrounds, desires and
vision [2–4]. Our spatial interventions transform
households, communities, neighborhoods and entire
cities [5], modifying their affordances [6].
A ubiquitous digital membrane [7] now covers cities
and alters our experience of space/time, filling it with
opportunities for interaction, interrelation and
communication [8][9][10] and creating entirely new
affordances for spaces.
In this paper we will present our efforts in
understanding the mutated perception of urban contexts,
and the possibility to visualize human beings' continuous
state of re-interpretation of the world.
A set of objectives has been set forth in the process:
• to gain a better understanding of human
presence in contemporary urban spaces;
• to understand the ways in which it is possible to
visualize the state of re-programming of the city
enacted by human beings;
• to assess issues such as ecology, mobility, land
use, need for services and infrastructures, sense
of place, definition of emergent boundaries,
attention groups, health, safety;
• to raise awareness about the ways in which
different cultures, languages, backgrounds,
religions, nationalities and political orientations
interpret the places of the city.

Abstract
While we perform our daily tasks we reinterpret
space and personalize it, according to tactics which
reveal significant information about ourselves.
We are now able to fill and stratify space/time with
digital information layers, completely wrapping cities in
a membrane of information and of opportunities for
interaction and communication.
Mobile devices, smartphones, wearables, digital
tags, near field communication devices, location based
services and mixed/augmented reality have turned the
world into an essentially read/write, ubiquitous
publishing surface.
The usage of mobile devices and ubiquitous
technologies alters the understanding of place.
The scenario described in this paper sees urban
spaces progressively filling with multiple layers of realtime, ubiquitous, digital information, creating usage
cases in which urban narratives are read in different
ways, highlighting how cities express points of view on
the environment, culture, economy, transports, energy
and politics.
The research presented in this paper analyses
multiple opportunities to capture, understand and
visualize the real-time digital lives of cities, from a
variety of points of view and objectives, dedicated to the
needs of administrations, citizens and organizations, and
to the possibility to transform these representations into
a form of disseminated, ubiquitous, interconnective
intelligence.
Keywords--social

2. Transforming the sense of place
Portable devices transform our experience of
space/time [11].
Devices like the Sony Walkman have allowed
human beings to alter their sense of place [12] and to
critically interpret the space around them [13].
Mobile devices and mixed/augmented reality
radicalize this process and have transformed the world
into a read/write, ubiquitous publishing surface [14].
Morley describes the ways in which mobile phones
create a geography of self [15], enacting a direct,

1. Introduction
Many researchers have investigated about the ways
in which we constantly re-program city spaces around us

personalized intervention into the design of space, which
becomes a continuous, emergent, fluid, recombinant
stratification of a n alog/digital information /
communication / interaction [16–18].
De Kerckhove [19] suggested the augmentation of
architecture to include the concepts created for the World
Wide Web, expanding our possibilities for awareness and
consciousness: using this approach it is possible to define
new usage grammars for time [20] and space [21].

3. ConnectiCity, methodology
ConnectiCity is an arts/science meta-project which
investigates the possibilities offered by the progressive
availability of real-time, ubiquitous, digital layers of
information, to design and implement a series of
prototypes which would pursue the following goals:
• to capture in real-time various forms of cityrelevant user generated content from social
networks, websites, mobile applications,
• to interrelate information to the territory [7][22]
using Geo-referencing, Geo-Parsing and GeoCoding techniques [23-26], and
• to analyze and classify information using
Natural Language Processing and Named Entity
Recognition techniques to identify emotions,
trending topics, urban discussions [27–29];
• to support decision-making processes for
administrations and individuals [30][31][32];
• to enact city-wide participatory processes [3339];
• to assess accessibility and usability for large
quantities of complex urban information
through novel interaction metaphors and
information visualization [40-43];
• to confront with validation models that would
allow to assess the quality, relevancy and
reliability of harvested data.

Figure 1: The Atlas of Rome
The Atlas of Rome's purpose was to portray in realtime the evolution of the visions, desires and actions
created by architects, institutions, operators and citizens
onto the city of Rome: 16 information domains had been
classified to describe the overall wellness of the city.
Information was captured from multiple sources and
parsed using Natural Language Analysis [44–45], and
then was geo-referenced either through GPS enabled
devices or by using a large database of Named Entities,
including the names of streets, malls, cinemas, museums,
landmarks, neighborhoods, common alternative names of
places, pubs, bars, shops, stores, gyms, and other dozens
of types of locations.
Content was also directly provided by citizens using
web and mobile interfaces.
Collected information was shown on the 35 meter
wide surface using a Processing application. Different
information visualizations were designed to aggregate
information according to themes, time-frames and types
of activities.
Passer-by's possibility to interact in real-time with
the installation produced radically positive effects: the
fact that a large-scale architectural surface was actually
responding in real-time to their interactions powerfully
combined with the tangible effect of having own
information published onto the projection. The combined
effect of being able to both contribute and interact had a
distinct empowering effect on people, who
spontaneously started to discuss possible uses for this
kind of system in areas such as participatory urban
planning, policy making and decision-making at city
level.
A neighborhood version of the Atlas was also
produced, to experiment on the possibility to visualize
the trending topics of the digital conversations taking
place in neighborhoods in which a smaller, urban-screen
based, version of the visualizations was placed.

4. Results
The ConnectiCity project is an on-going process
started in 2008. Since then a continuous refinement of
the methodologies and technologies has allowed for the
creation of several prototypes which implement the
concepts conceived in the investigation phase.

4.2. The Atlas of Rome
After an initial test produced for the Franz Mayer
museum in Mexico City, we designed a 35 meter long
architectural projection and sound environment for
Rome's “Festa dell'Architettura” in 2010, organized by
the City Administration together with the Italian Order of
the Architects.

The platform tested on 6 urban contexts (Milan,
Berlin, London, Bristol, New York and Philadelphia) and
was made available to users on a web interface.
Listeners autonomously suggested multiple usage
scenarios for the platform, describing participatory

The possibility to harvest information in real-time
from cities using user generated content on social
networks was used in occasion of the first instantiation of
the VersuS project.
