Millions of women are suffering from breast cancer
today. Breast cancer can be treated effectively when
detected early. Mammography is broadly recognized as
the most effective imaging modality for an early
detection of breast cancer abnormalities. Computeraided diagnosis systems are very helpful for radiologist
in detection and diagnosing abnormalities earlier and
faster than traditional screening programs. In this paper,
two techniques are proposed based on statistical and
LBP features using support vector machine (SVM) and
the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. The evaluation
of the system is applied on Digital Database for
Screening Mammography (DDSM). The system classifies
normal from abnormal cases with high accuracy rate.

Using enhanced images and segment the suspicious
area , extract features , select more accurate features and
then classify them into appropriate category are the most
important steps that computer aided detection systems
should follow.
However, due to low contrast and strong noise,
digital mammograms are among the most difficult
medical images to analyze [8]. The intensity level of
mammogram is affected by breast tissue types, vessels,
different masses of calcification, and noise.
Feature extraction is considered as the most
effective step in mammogram classification [1]. Texture
features are commonly used in the analysis and
interpretation of mammogram images. Mammography
textures can be distinguished based on Malagelada’s
approach [10] in the three following stages:

Keywords: Mammographic images; cancer detection;
Support Vector Machine; Local Binary Pattern.

Abstract

Statistical methods: The extracted features of this
class include those obtained from co-occurrence
matrices,
surface
variation
measurements
(smoothness, coarseness and regularity) [10], and
run-length statistics [11], [12].
2. Model-based methods: The analysis of texture
features in this class is based on prior models such
as Markov random fields [13], auto-regressive
models, and fractals [7].
3. Signal processing methods: In this class, texture
features are obtained according to either pixel
characteristics or image frequency spectrum
including Laws energy filtering [10], Gabor filtering
[10], local binary pattern [14] and multi resolution
analysis such as Wavelets [15], Curvlets [16], and
contourlets [1].
After feature extraction, selecting the appropriate
classifier plays an important role for obtaining good
result, there are many classifier have been used such as
k-nearest neighbors(KNN) [15], support vector
machines(SVM) [1],[9], Neural Network(NN) [7],
Euclidean Distance [16], and Bayesian classifier [17].
This work aimed at improving performance of the
current mammogram classification methods to
differentiate between normal and abnormal cases. We try
to make a combination between different type of features
such as the statistical features and the signal processing
features, then The SVM and KNN classifiers are used to
assess these features.

1. Introduction
Breast cancer is reported as the second most deadly
cancer in the world on which public awareness has been
increasing during the last few decades [1]. According to
the American National Cancer Institute [2], it is
estimated that every 3 min a woman is diagnosed with
breast cancer and every 13 min, a woman dies from this
disease. It is known that the best prevention method is
the precocious diagnosis, what lessens the mortality and
improves the treatment [3]. Despite the increasing
number of cancers being diagnosed, the death rate has
been reduced remarkably in the past decade due to the
screening programs [4]. Premature detection of breast
cancer increases the prospect of survival whereas
delayed diagnosis frequently confronts the patient to an
unrecoverable stage and results in death [5].
Mammography [6] is widely recognized as the most
effective imaging modality for an early detection of
breast cancer abnormalities, and its proper scheduled is
now the most used strategy for the earlier detection of
tumor [7].
However, medical centers almost everywhere today
are facing a challenge in analyzing the increasingly high
volume of mammograms [8]. Hence, Many ComputerAided Diagnosis (CAD) Systems have been proposed to
help radiologists for mammogram analysis, and
potentially reduce the number of diagnostic errors [9].

up the result. Since the LBP was, by definition, invariant
to monotonic changes in gray scale, it was supplemented
by an orthogonal measure of local contrast [14].

2. Methodology
The proposed method based on two different types
of features which are statistical features, Local binary
pattern (LBP) features. The next two subsections
describe the statistical and the LBP features in details.

The Fig.1 shows how the contrast measure (C) was
derived. The average of the gray levels below the center
pixel is subtracted from that of the gray levels above (or
equal to) the center pixel. Two-dimensional distributions
of the LBP and local contrast measures were used as
features. The operator was called LBP/C.

2.1. Statistical Features
Statistical features affect significantly in pattern
recognition area. We have selected six feature calculated
from the mammogram image histogram which are Mean,
Standard Deviation, Smoothness, Skewness, energy, and
entropy [ 18]

2.2.2. The Extended Local Binary Patterns: The
derivation of the LBP follows that represented by Ojala
[20]. Let us define texture T as the joint distribution of
the gray levels of
image pixels:

Where corresponds to the gray value of the center
pixel of a local neighborhood
Correspond to the gray values of P equally spaced pixels
on a circle of radius
that forms a circularly
symmetric set of neighbors. Fig.2 illustrates three
circularly symmetric neighbor sets for different values of
P and R.

2.2. Local binary pattern (LBP)
Local binary pattern (LBP) is a popular technique
used for image representation and classification [14].
LBP has been widely applied in various applications due
to its high discriminative power and tolerance against
illumination changes such as texture analysis and object
recognition.

Figure 2: Circularly symmetric neighbor sets for
different (P; R). [20]

2.2.1. The Original Local Binary Patterns: The
LBP operator was first introduced as a complementary
measure for local image contrast by Ojala [19]. The first
incarnation of the operator worked with the eightneighbors of a pixel, using the value of the center pixel
as a threshold. An LBP code for a neighborhood was
produced by multiplying the threshold values with
weights given to the corresponding pixels, and summing

with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the

averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single

image, which is unrelated to local image texture, it can
be ignored:
Although invariant against gray scale shifts, the
differences are affected by scaling. To achieve
invariance with respect to any monotonic transformation
of the gray scale, only the signs of the differences are
considered:

3. Result and Discussion
The proposed methods are applied on 512 ROI taken
from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography
(DDSM). ROI are cropped from the mammogram image.
All the cropped images that represent the normal (256
cases) and mass (256 cases) are resized to 256 × 256.

each
neighborhood into a unique LBP code:

The proposed method is tested by first extracting
statistical features only from each sub image. Dividing
the mammogram image into N × N sub-images are tested
with different values of N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to see the
effect of different number of sub-images on the
classification rate. The SVM and KNN classifiers are
also used to classify the feature vectors to better validate
our features extraction technique. Table 2 shows the
result for each number of sub-images where N × N (1×1,
2×2, 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, 6×6) and also the result for each
classifier. We found that the best classification rates are
obtained at 3×3 sub-images using SVM classifier (98.43)
and for KNN it was (95.10) at 6×6 sub-images.

2.3. Proposed method
In the previous sections we already describe the
statistical and LBP features and how they are extracted
from the ROI of mammogram image. Figure 3 shows the
block diagram of the proposed method in which the
feature vectors are created from both the statistical and
the LBP features. Where, the mammogram image is
divided to N × N sub-images. For each image, the
statistical and the LBP features are extracted from each
sub-image to create the feature vector to be passed to the
classifier. The vectors of features for all images in the
dataset are passed to the classifier.

Similarly, the proposed method is tested by taking
the LBP features only from each sub-image. Table 3
shows the detailed result when taking only the LBP
feature. The best classification rate (98.43) is obtained at
5x5 sub-images using SVM classifier. Also, the best
classification rate (97.06) using KNN classifier was at
4x4 sub-images.

The support vector machine classifier (SVM) and
the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) are used in the
classification stage, while, the K fold cross validation
method is used as well. K-fold cross validation randomly
partitions the vectors of features of mammographic
images in the dataset into k subsamples of vectors, Of the
k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the

Figure 4: comparison of using different features
type and classifier

The best classification rate obtained when using
either the statistical or LBP features was (98.43) and it is
obtained using the SVM classifier. Now, we will
combine the two features together in one feature vector.
The results obtained by using both features are described
in table 4. The best classification rates (98.63 using SVM)
and (97.25 using KNN) is obtained when extracting features
from 4x4 sub-images.

Conclusion
In this paper we have presented two techniques for
classification of abnormality in digital mammograms.
We have discussed the statistical and LBP features as a
good tool for features extraction. This research has
shown that our method is very effective for the automatic
detection and classification of abnormalities in digital
mammogram. The evaluation of the system is carried out
on DDSM dataset. Our method achieved very good
results. Mammography is one of the best approaches in
breast cancer detection, but in some cases, radiologists
cannot detect tumors despite their experience. Such
computer- aided methods like those presented in this
paper could assist medical stuff and improve the
accuracy of detection. The proposed method achieves
best classification rates (98.63 using SVM) and (97.25 using
KNN) with features extracted from 16 (4×4) sub-images,
especially when using the statistical and the LBP features
together. Also, the SVM classifier gives best
classification rate than KNN classifier.
