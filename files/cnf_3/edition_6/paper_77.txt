Abstract
There are many deficiencies in the traditional
electronic commerce schema. The main problem for
consideration is the text and picture based design that
underpins current HTML systems.
This paper presents the online grocery shopping
system called Easy Grocery which is available at
www.easygrocery.co.uk. This system is based on the
innovative concept of using a 3D system as an interface to
the user during their shopping experience. Furthermore,
this 3D system follows the mental model of the user as
opposed to that of the developer. Additionally, the user is
able to select the layout of the online store so that it
matches the layout of their local store, thus enabling even
new users to exploit their own knowledge of how items are
organised to shop efficiently. The Easy Grocery system
demonstrates that 3D online shopping can provide
significant advantages for both consumers and retailers.

Grocery Shopping

The whole concept and experience of Grocery
shopping has undergone a complete transformation over
the last century. Historically, the industrial revolution saw
the advent of a new wave of technologies which
significantly affected key issues such as Transportation and
the use of factories [1]. A new channel for the distribution
of groceries evolved in which multiple shops, or “chains”
were established. The ensuing price vs quality challenges
persuaded smaller local suppliers to group together as
organized chains. National brands were recognized, pricing
systems were developed and market leaders naturally
evolved.
Modern developments include the self-service system,
centralized distribution, Co-Operatives, foreign food
imports and the arrival of the supermarket. In 1997, Seth et
al. [1] estimated that 2% of an average adult life was spent
inside a supermarket. Thus, supermarkets have become an
important part of our society today.

Shopping online

In 1990, Berners-Lee [2] released the first World Wide
Web (Web) browser. During the “dot com” boom of the
1990s, many grocery chains joined the Web by offering
online grocery ordering. Despite high predictions at that
time, the online grocery market (e-grocery) has not realized
the heights that were forecast [3]. However, the e-grocery
market has undergone a smaller amount of consistent
growth. One of the reasons for the reduced (albeit stable)
growth was defined by Kempiak et al. [4]. They found that
the “high-touch” characteristic of many grocery items
results in the necessity for consumers to physically and/or
visually inspect the quality of the specific items they are
purchasing.
Clearly consumers who have specific time limitations
constitute a significant portion of the e-grocery market.
However, there are other significant groups in society for
which e-grocery is very important, namely, consumers with
mobility problems and disabilities. Clearly, the busy queue
based traditional shopping environments are not ideally
suited to Disabled or Elderly consumers. Experiments [5]
have shown that the “current (supermarket based),
inarguably efficient retail system does not take the needs of
the elderly and disabled into account”. Therefore, it is not
surprising that Cude et al. [6] found that almost 15% of egrocery shoppers cite physical constraints as the primary
reason that they use the Internet to buy groceries.

Visualization in Online Shopping

In general, customers want more from their shopping
experience than simply the selection of items from a long,
scrolling, text-based list of items. Naturally, it is true that
customers want to be able to access the facts about the
items they are buying. The nutritional information of a
specific breakfast cereal is an example. However, further to
simply reviewing the facts about an item, the customer also
wants to be able to visualize the item, to assess its shape or
colour and to inspect the design features of the item. This

applies to everything from buying digital cameras to the
latest designer clothes.
The recent trend in online shopping is taking the
visualization of items online one step further than
fundamental snapshots of the items. Three dimensional
models of items are widely used within online shopping by
major companies such as Sony, Tesco, Amazon, EBuyer,
Panasonic, 3Com, Lexmark and Dell. These companies are
dealing with one of the main challenges of online
shopping, namely the ability of the customers to have some
experience of the items before they purchase them.
The use of 3D models enables these companies to
represent and convey their products more fully [7] to the
customer. The main use of 3D models is to show every
angle of a product. Some companies also integrate
animation and interaction. Furthermore, some companies
provide models for the customer so that he/she can
virtually “try on” the item. In particular, this concept
applies to fashion sales but also to areas such as hair
dressing, where the customer can visualize, beforehand,
what a hairstyle/colour would look like on them. These
technologies are increasingly popular and when used they
result in improved sales [8].



the unfamiliar experience of e-grocery shopping
for first time users
Easy Grocery uses a 3D world that provides a platform
from which these issues can be addressed.
Therefore, the key issue is the system interface to the
consumer. It is understood [9] that an effective interface
design is one that follows the user’s ‘mental model’ of the
scene (and not that of the developer). Based on their own
experience of shopping in their local supermarket,
consumers have a lot of knowledge of the location of
everyday items of food within their local supermarket. This
is the main advantage of Easy Grocery which capitalizes
on the specialist knowledge of the user.

4.1

Navigation within the Store

The Easy Grocery store is portrayed in 3D at all times.
This provides a complete, all angle interrogation of any
item of merchandise anytime. As the user moves through
the store, the items within the current view are
transformed.

The “Easy Grocery” system

Easy Grocery is an e-grocery ordering system that can
be used by customers to do their grocery shopping online.
Figure 2: 90 Degree view transformation
The traditional cursor keys are employed to move the
view (user) around the store. The mouse is also used to
rotate the view (akin to the user moving their head). Figure
2 shows a view transformation from one corner of the
store. The view is rotated around the Y axis so as to look
down another aisle. This transformation is completed upon
the user moving the mouse left or right. In order to keep
the system close to reality the upside down backward
viewing is restricted. Additionally, actions such as walking
through shelves, stacks, and walls are restricted. Store
navigation and view transformations are completed at the
request of the user.
Figure 1: The Easy Grocery domain
The subject domain of Easy Grocery is shown in Figure 1.
Fundamentally, Easy Grocery uses techniques from 3D
visualization in order to enhance the customer’s experience
of e-grocery. Thus, the main aim of Easy Grocery is to
provide consumers with a familiar shopping environment.
Some of the common complaints about e-grocery
systems include
 orientation problems: consumers not being able to
find the correct items
 precision issues: consumer uncertainty in their
product selection, and,

4.2

Using Easy Grocery

When using Easy Grocery the consumer places the
cross in the center of the screen over the product they wish
to purchase. The left mouse button can then be used to
place the selected product in the consumer’s trolley.
Alternatively, right clicking on a selected product
allows the user to view details of the product. Easy
Grocery provides the detail of any product when requested
by the user [10]. These details are not visible to the user
unless requested, thus allowing for a swifter, more efficient
shop for those who are more experienced. All information

can be displayed about each product that exists within the
store. Figure 3 shows the details of a pizza within Easy
Grocery. In this figure the exact weight and dimensions
can be seen, amongst other items of data. The current
details dialog is simple but functional.

constitute Order Three are shown in detail, including the
quantity of each item required and their unit prices.

Figure 5: Specific order details

Figure 3: Product details when requested
Whilst shopping, tracking your orders is supported by
the Easy Grocery built-in Order Manager. A snapshot of
the Order Manager is shown in Figure 4. In this snapshot,
three orders are shown, one of which is due to be delivered
on the 21st September 2006. The customer has selected
these delivery dates. The cost of each order is shown as
well as the current status of the order. Orders can have one
of four states. These include: Just ordered, Picking,
Delivered and Refunded.

Finally, based on the fact that customers often order
very similar goods repeatedly, Easy Grocery provides the
user with the facility to view orders which they made in the
past. All orders made within the past 24 months can be
viewed by the user at any time. This can be very useful as
it helps users “remember” a special wine they once ordered
for a certain visitor or for other speciality and seasonal
shopping. Specific items within an order can have one of
three states. These are: Accepted, Refunded and Waiting
for stock.

4.3

The use of 3D visualization

In contrast to traditional e-grocery systems, shopping
within a 3D online supermarket provides additional
information about the merchandise.

Figure 4: Order summary screen
From the Order Manager it is possible to view the
details of any order by double clicking upon that order.
This will provide the user with all of the order details
shown in the Products Ordered window. A snapshot of the
Products Ordered window, for Order Number Three, is
shown in Figure 5. In this snapshot, the items that

Figure 6: Natural magnitude ruling
Figure 6 shows a snapshot from the Easy Grocery
system. In this snapshot, four shelves of chocolate bars are
shown (for demonstration purposes). From the snapshot, it
is clear that the chocolate bars on the top shelf are
significantly smaller than the others. As a result of the
visualization of the chocolate bars, this information is

obvious. However, this is exactly the type of information
that traditional text-based, HTML e-grocery systems fail to
convey. Clearly, receiving (and paying for) the correct
quantity of groceries is a major part of customer
satisfaction.

Store Layout

within a store they know well in London without having to
go there. The geographically local store would then deliver
the goods as usual, even though the consumer may have
experienced the layout of another store.

4.6

The Easy Grocery Structure

The system structure of Easy Grocery involves two
major divisions: the server and the client. The client is a
light weight 3D environment with accompanying system
management. The small client handles both the 3D
environment and the system control. System control
includes functionality such as Internet communications,
order management, store settings and launching the 3D
environment.

Figure 7: Spatial encoding, areas of the store
Most supermarkets have complex stock placement
systems based on many factors. The concept of gathering
similar types of product together within the store results in
the creation of specialized areas of the store. For example,
most supermarkets have a freezer section and a fresh
produce section. This spatial encoding can be mimicked by
Easy Grocery.
The snapshot of Easy Grocery, shown in Figure 7,
depicts how these areas can be perceived from the far end
of a store. Thus, the type of product is given by the
product’s location within the store. Other attributes of
products can also be represented by their location, such as
special offers, which are located at strategic points.

4.5

Online shopping locally, anywhere

Easy Grocery can dynamically rearrange every aspect
of the online store to match the consumer’s own personal
preferences. Thus, the consumer can decide how the store
will be laid out. Furthermore, Easy Grocery can be
rearranged to exactly match the layout of the consumer’s
local supermarket. Therefore, if the user is familiar with a
particular supermarket, Easy Grocery can transform itself
to match the layout of this supermarket. Every item of
merchandise is relocated to match that request. The
dimensions of the supermarket are emulated, walls are
resized, stacks are relocated, shelves are rearranged, and
products are restocked. Consequently the user is then able
to apply their expert knowledge of this familiar
environment to their online grocery shopping experience.
This has many benefits for consumers. For example, a
consumer living in Edinburgh could browse and shop

Figure 8: The server’s connection control
The server side of the system includes database
control, Internet communications and load management. A
snapshot of the local shop server is shown in Figure 8. All
current consumers are visible on the server’s list of users.
This allows Easy Grocery to handle large amounts of users
and to easily detect when the quantity of users is
approaching the system’s limit. The connection monitor
also records the connection total over time. This enables
the system manager to gain vital information about
connection habits.
This server – client system enables the content, such as
order data, to be the only information that is sent across the
Internet. Data transfer within standard HTML, form-based,
grocery systems requires the complete form to be
downloaded as well as the “order data”, in order to send
the data inputted by the user. As the form is the larger part

of the communication, this results in a slow and ineffective
transmission of the data required.
Easy Grocery supercedes this style of system by solely
sending the content data. It only requires the content to be
downloaded, not any of the data to do with the presentation
and visualization system. All of this communication
between the client and the server is encoded in a light
weight protocol.
The system model is thus made flexible enough to
split customer orders between several suppliers. Therefore,
the Easy Grocery system can allow a number of local
producers or retailers to act as one online supermarket
thereby creating online distribution for smaller, local
producers.

4.7

HTML Compatibility

The Easy Grocery system works in parallel with the
current traditional HTML e-grocery systems. Thus, a
consumer may choose to use the traditional HTML view
for their shopping or to utilize the Easy Grocery system.
The purchasing system will produce the same result
regardless of the view chosen by the user. Hence, the
supermarket is supplied with the same information in each
case.

Conclusions

Easy Grocery can provide significant advantages for
consumers who are both new and experienced to online
grocery shopping. The main advantage is the familiarity
and confidence that shopping in a familiar environment
provides. The knowledge of product placement results in a
much faster and satisfactory shopping experience. Since
groceries are classified as “high touch” items, Easy
Grocery engages the consumer by providing them with the
virtual experience of seeing and possibly inspecting the
product.
Easy Grocery has the potential to deliver four main
improvements to the current e-grocery shopping
experience
 An increasing to the popularity of e-grocery
shopping due to the use of a familiar environment
for the user.
 Accuracy of ordering due to the fact that users can
visually inspect and view the physical attributes of
the items they are ordering.
 Faster shopping experiences due to reduced
search times.
 The potential for future expansion and sales
enhancing features.
Empirical testing showed that the navigation and control
system is a new experience for many people. However, the
average shopping times for randomly generated shopping
lists were decreased when compared to current World

Wide Web technologies. All of those who assessed Easy
Grocery, elected Easy Grocery over the traditional egrocery alternatives.

Future Work

Consumers who shop in traditional bricks-and-mortar
settings also do so for the social interaction that the
environment can provide. One facet of future work is the
development of a communal shopping environment where
a consumer can make their presence known and interact
with fellow shoppers.
Additionally,
bricks-and-mortar
shopping
environments have a lot of advantages in terms of friendly
assistants and celebrity sponsors. Future work could also
include celebrity employees, such as chefs like Jamie
Oliver, and personal health advisors. In a world where
consumers are becoming increasingly mindful of what they
eat, to have a professional, such as the food guru Gillian
Mc Keith, providing you with accurate nutritional advice
and recommendations on products would have an impact
on both sales and health.
A consumer’s ability to find new products they require
is greatly enhanced by shopping within their own local
store. However, there are still likely to be products that a
consumer cannot find, particularly if it is a new product to
the consumer or the store. A search feature will be
implemented where the customer can be ‘whisked’ from
their current position in the store straight to the product
required.
Although Easy Grocery was conceptualized to remedy
traditional e-grocery deficiencies, the world of e-grocery
has expanded well beyond its origins. As such e-grocery
has many beneficial and constructive techniques that can
be propagated to Easy Grocery. Techniques include, but
are not limited to, the consumer starting a shop with the
items from the consumer’s last purchase already in their
trolley and recipe based shopping.
On an abstract level Easy Grocery may be
disseminated into other domains. Such scenarios could
involve an operator searching for hundreds of items
amongst thousands. The items would be grouped and
ordered spatially based on the required factors. This idea
can be implemented to successfully select specific data
from a large number of alternatives.
There is significant opportunity for future expansion
of this concept. Current e-grocery systems are generally
flawed by the fact that they are designed based on the
software engineer’s implementation model of the process
of shopping. For example, the picture and text layout of
current e-grocery systems conform to a developer friendly
model.
However, the user has their own cognitive model of
the shopping process, such as the layout of their preferred
supermarket, due to repetitive and regular shopping. This
knowledge needs to be exploited more substantially. It is

anticipated that such an implementation of a user-based
model of the shopping process would revolutionize online
shopping
