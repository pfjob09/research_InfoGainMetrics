Abstract
One of the main goals of high-dimensional data
visualization is to reduce dimensions, so that the data
can be projected onto 2-D or 3-D space. This paper
proposes a stimulation spectrum based visualization
approach, in which each high-dimension data is
regarded as a stimulation spectrum and the change of
each value of data attribute corresponds to the change of
wavelength of visible spectrum. According to the
relationship between stimulation spectrum and color
space, we can project high-dimensional data onto 3dimensional space, and easily observe the distribution of
the data. We also demonstrate this novel approach with
synthetic data and real data, and the result is very
promising.
Keywords--- high-dimensional data visualization,
Stimulation Spectrum, RGB model, reduce dimension.

1. Introduction
High-dimensional data visualization is the technique
with respect to the data in large databases, aimed at
visualizing very large datasets in databases by images
and pictures. In general, each attribute of a highdimensional data item is regarded as a space dimension,
and all attributes make up the high-dimensional data
space. In order to present high-dimensional data items by
images and pictures, we should project the points in
high-dimensional data space onto a 2-D or 3-D space.
There are two types of commonly used projective
methods [1]. One type of projective methods is to divide
the 2-D plane into several parts, each part representing
an attribute. Methods such as parallel coordinates [2],
tree maps [3], and the pixel-oriented method [6] belong
to this type. These methods make it easy to analyze each
attributes but difficult to reflect the whole feature of the
data. The other type of projective methods is to give
weight to the attributes of n-dimensional data according
to the relative importance and then linearly combine
them. These methods include Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) [7], Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS)

[4], and Self-Organising Maps (SOM) [8]. But the final
result is very sensitive to the value of weight, any small
change of weight can greatly alter the result.
In this paper, we propose a new method to project
high-dimensional data, which use stimulation spectrum
and color model to project high-dimensional data onto a
3-D space. The projected dataset reflects the ndimensional attributes of data but is not the simple linear
combination of each attribute. It does well to reflect the
whole the position relationship among the highdimensional dataset.

2. Stimulation spectrum and RGB model
The basic idea comes from the RGB model and
stimulation spectrum. We know that the light or different
color people can sense is the narrow frequency band in
electromagnetism frequency spectrum. Each color is the
summation of a kind of energy distribution in different
wavelengths of the electromagnetism spectrum. The
energy carried by visible light (approximately 400-700
nm) stimulates the receptors in the human retina and
produces different colors. This energy distribution is
called stimulation spectrum.
On the other hand, each color can be expressed by 3color models, such as the RGB model, the CMY model,
and the HSV model [5]. In the RGB model red, green
and blue are used as basic colors to define the coordinate
axes and each point C for a color is expressed by the (R,
G, B) coordinates (see figure 1):

Figure 1 RGB Color Model
Every stimulation spectrum function Φ(λ) can be
transformed into a point in the RGB color space. The
quantitative relationship between the stimulation

spectrum Φ(λ) and RGB color coordinate can be
computed by the transformation formula below:
R = k * ∑ Φ (λ ) * r (λ ) * Δ λ
λ

G = k *

∑λ

Φ (λ ) * g (λ ) * Δ λ

B = k *

∑λ

Φ (λ ) * b (λ ) * Δ λ

˄2.2˅

In the above formula, k is the ratio. λ refers to the
wavelength of the visible light, ranging from 400nm to
700nm, Δλ=5nm. r(λ), g(λ), and b(λ) are called color
matching functions which play an important role for the
transformation between RGB color model and spectrum.
Each value of r(λ), g(λ) and b(λ) at every 5nm is
measured by CIE (Commission Internationale de
l'Eclairage), which is already known. The tristimulus
curves in Figure 2 describe the color matching functions
of the CIE 1931 Standard Colorimetric System, where
r(λ), g(λ) and b(λ) curves stand for color matching
functions and Φ(λ) curve is the stimulation spectrum
function. By using the three color matching functions,
any stimulation spectrum can be described as a point in
the RGB space.

means there is a point in RGB 3-D space to show this
high-dimensional data.
Each data item in high-dimensional space can be
plotted by a polygonal line in parallel coordinates [2] as
shown in Figure 4. This polygonal line can be viewed as
a stimulation spectrum curve if the axes in parallel
coordinates are spread evenly within the range of the
wavelength of the visible lights. Then the data item can
be regarded as the stimulation spectrum function Φ(λ),
the attribute values will correspond to the wavelength λ.
Then the RGB color space can be regarded as a mapping
space for the high-dimensional data.

3.2. Projection
Suppose D={X1, X2, …, Xm} is a set of data in ndimensional data space and each data item Xǂ=(xi1,
xi2, …, xij…, xin), (i≤m), then we can calculate the 3-D
coordinates of data Xi according to formula (3.1), which
comes from formula (2.2) with X(λ) instead of Ф(λ):
x = k * ∑ Xi ( λ ) * r ( λ ) * Δ λ

3.1. Basic idea
From above analysis we can see that each kind of
spectrum spreading within the range of visible lights can
show a certain color. The mapping between the spectrum
and the color can be computed by the color matching
function. If the high-dimensional data is considered as
the distribution of the spectrum within the range of
visible lights, then a certain color can be found, which

Figure 5 shows the relationship between X (λ) and
Ф(λ), the horizontal axes stands for data attributes
(corresponding to the wavelength λ), the vertical axes
stands for values of attributes (corresponding to the
spectrum energy E).
For example, if Xi is a 6-dimensional data (xi1,
xi2, …, xi6), then: Xi(λ) = xi1, ( 400≤λ<450 );
Xi(λ) = xi2, ( 450≤λ<500 );
……;
Xi(λ) = xi6,
( 650≤λ<700 ).
Therefore, each high-dimensional data item can be
transformed into a point in the RGB color space, which
means each high-dimensional data item is represented by
a certain color. By adjusting the value of k, the ratio in
the formula, the mapping space can be not only the RGB
color space, but also an arbitrary 3-D space.

should satisfy the following equations:

values and stimulation spectrums

3.3. Analyses of color matching functions
Since the values of color matching functions are
already known, the process of mapping high-dimensional
data items can also be viewed as a kind of weight linear
combination and the color matching functions can be
regarded as the weighs. By taking advantage of color
matching functions to convert high-dimensional data, we
can completely project the data onto projection space.
Since the main aim of color matching functions is to map
stimulation spectrums on color space, it can correctly
map the similar spectrums to similar points in color
space, for example the spectrums corresponding to green
can be mapped closely to the green corner and the
red/blue spectrums can be mapped to the red/blue
corners. We can imagine that every high dimensional
data corresponds a spectrum, similar data correspond
similar spectrums, and then they will be more closer in
the mapping space.
From the curves of color matching functions (figure
2), we know that n dimensions can be divided into 3
parts: b(λ) corresponds to the front part of the data
attributes, g(λ) mainly corresponds to the middle part of
the data attributes, and r(λ) mainly to the last part of the
data attributes. In this way, the projection result of a data
item will be described by all of the 3 coordinates. For
example, if two points of data are different only in the
values of the last attributes, their points in mapping space
will be only apart from each other on axes X, and their
coordinates of axes Y and axes Z is the same. If a data
has nearly equal values for all attributes, the mapping
result must be x=y=z, which means the data falls on the
diagonal line of the mapping space. The other advantage
of the transformation is that the color matching functions
filled same area which makes the axes in mapping space
has the same range, so the data will not be overconcentrated around some axes.

3.4. Outliers
Many different stimulation spectrums may display
the same color, which is called metamerism. Similarly, in
mapping space, two different high-dimensional data
items may also be projected to the same point. So there
are some points which are quite different from their
neighbors but mapped into the same area, these points
are called outliers. If two points (Xi , Xj)are mapped to

(3.2)

It is too complicated to use the equations. A simple
and feasible way is to directly compare the distance to its
neighbors. So we will divide the mapping space into K
subspaces (hyper-cube), and compute the distances dist(i)
from each point to all other points in the same subspace,
Euclid distance is applied here:
d (i, j ) = ( xi1 − x j1) 2 + ( xi 2 − x j 2) 2 + ... + ( xi 2 − x j 2) 2
dist

(i) =

∑

d (i, j)

(3.4)
If the dist(i) of a data is apparently larger than that
of others, then we can regard this data item as an outlier.
We can record the minimum distance as mindist, and if
dist(i)>p*mindist, the point is regarded as an outlier. The
value of p can be determined based on the size and the
accuracy of data.
j=1

3.5. Processes of the mapping
The processes using color model to map the highdimensional data include 6 steps:
1 Divide the high-D space into equal-size k subspaces;
2 Initialize data set;
3 Read the value of r(λ), g(λ) and b(λ);
4 For each data {
calculate (X, Y, Z)based on formula(3.1);
draw the point in mapping space;
record the point to its subspace;}
5 For each subspace {
calculate dist (i): the sum of distance from ith point
to its neighbors;
record the minimums dis(i) as mindist; }
6 Scan all data, if dist(i)>p*mindist, mark the point as
an outlier.

4. Experiences
4.1. Synthetic data
In the experiment, we use a 5-dimensional synthetic
dataset with 32 data items. It includes 32 characters like
a, b, c, …, x, y, z, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Every attribute
value is listed in table 1. From the table, we know that
‘a’ and ‘b’ are the closest points in 5-D space because
they have the same values except attribute A1. For the
same reason, ‘c’ and ‘f’, ‘k’ and ‘h’, ‘m’ and ‘s’ are the
closest data in 5-D space, and ‘b’ should stand between
‘a’ and ‘c’. So we can give a basic topology of the
distribution in figure 6. With our method, we can
describe the distribution in 3-D space. The result is
displayed in figure 7, adjacent and linear relationships
illustrate that the transformation can preserve the
topology of the original data.

comparison, we use the colors obtained from above. It is
clear that parallel coordinates can display each attribute
for each data while our method can observe the topology
of the whole data set.

5. Conclusions
This paper proposes a stimulation spectrum based
high-dimensional data projection method. Its main idea
is to regard a high-dimensional data as a stimulation
spectrum, so the data can be projected to a mapping
space which is extended from the RGB color space. If
the width of each axes is 200, up to 2003=8,000,000 data
items can be described. Since the wavelength of visible
spectrum varies from 400nm to 700nm, and Δλ=5nm, so up
to 60-dimensional data can be processed. This method
offers a new idea to visualize high-dimensional datasets.
It is an initial idea to use color science to visualization.
The future work mainly concentrates on domain
applications and biases research. Some domain data have
physical relationship to spectrums or color model which
can be used to find some useful information and measure
the biases of the mapping.

A 6-dimensional car data containing 400 points was
used in our testing experiment. The attributes in the data
are: fuel economy in miles per gallon, number of
cylinders in the engine, engine displacement in cubic
inches, output of the engine in horsepower, 0 to 60 mph
acceleration, and vehicle weight. Figure 8 shows the
result using the color matching functions projection. The
side length of the mapping space is 255. In order to
improve the quality of the result, we divide the space to 8
cubes, the data in same cube have the same color. The
distribution of the data set can be observed clearly, and
some main regions can be found easily.
