Abstract—It has been long thought that the main cause of a
heart attack is the narrowing of an artery from the buildup of
fatty plaque inside the artery wall. Postmortem autopsy studies
on patients who have died after a myocardial infarction (heart
attack) found that many of those did not have their arteries
severely narrowed by plaque. Instead, thrombosis (blood clots)
near ruptured lesions were identified as the actual main cause.
The search for the type of culprit lesions has established that
the formation of a lipid-rich pool covered by a thin fibrous cap
(thickness less than 65 micrometer) was structurally unstable
and likely to rupture. Subsequently, the term vulnerable plaque
has been used to refer to this type of plaque.
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a new imaging
modality capable of providing the required micrometer scale
resolution to detect such tissue. With a resolution of approximately 15 micrometer, OCT is considered the most promising
imaging modality for identifying vulnerable plaque.
We present a complete framework for reliable tissue characterization of different plaque types using OCT images. Our
framework utilizes texture analysis as delineating features. In
addition, a parametric classification technique is presented. The
characterization performance of the proposed framework is
assessed and evaluated.

the repetitive nature of texture patterns. Statistical measures,
on the other hand, are spatial domain measures that rely on
the ordered distribution of texture patterns. Finally, structural measures rely on the geometric properties of texture
elements.
A close examination of OCT images reveals a texture
structure (figure 1) formed by the distribution of intensity
variation spots known as speckle. Speckle appears in OCT
images as a result of multiple interferences between coherent
waves [10] scattered from coarse (at the microscopic level)
surfaces. While speckle is generally viewed as a source of
noise, it has been suggested [11], [12] that it may be possible
to use texture analysis to differentiate between tissue types
based on features of their speckle.
To date only a few attempts have been made to utilize
OCT speckle texture analysis. Qi et al. [13], [14] used
center-symmetric auto-correlation (CSAC) for the texture
features and principal component analysis (PCA) for the
classification to develop computer-aided diagnosis CAD
algorithms that aid the detection of dysplasia in Barrett’s
esophagus. Jang et al. [15], [16] used the normalized standard deviation as a texture measure to demonstrate the
capability of OCT to quantify macrophage density. Zysk and
Boppart used spatial and Fourier-domain analysis to identify

I. I NTRODUCTION
OCT is a new imaging modality that uses safe nonionizing infrared laser to generate high resolution images
of tissues. Much like ultrasound, in which the image is
built using the backscattered signal, OCT generates grayscale images from the backscattered infrared signal. Due to
its high resolution, OCT is considered the most promising
imaging modality for detecting the vulnerable plaque in vivo
as well as for studying its natural progression [1]–[8].
Texture analysis [9] has been utilized in both the segmentation and characterization of different types of images.
While texture is a hard-to-formalize concept, it is generally
described as repetitive patterns of elementary constructs
formed by intensity/color variations. Texture measures can
be broadly divided into three major types, spectral, statistical, and structural measures. Spectral measures are,
loosely speaking, frequency domain measures that rely on

then propose features that can capture these characteristics as
quantitative measures. Figure 2 presents closeup samples of
the three plaque types. While there is an obvious difference
in the intensity range between fibrous plaque and the other
two types, the difference is not as clearly discernible between
calcified plaque and lipid plaque. Looking at the texture
element scale, one can see that fibrous plaque has the smallest texture elements while lipid plaque posses the largest
texture elements. In terms of structure and order, calcified
plaque comes in between the lipid plaque at the high end
and the fibrous plaque at the low end (fibrous plaque has
smaller rapidly changing elements that appear more random
compared to the larger slowly changing elements in lipid).
We propose two texture measures to differentiate between
the three types of plaque. The first measure is the normalized
variance (variance divided by mean intensity value). This
measure should capture the variation in the texture element
size as well as the sharp versus slow transitions in the
intensity values at the texture element scale. The second
texture measure, entropy, is intended to quantify the structure
and order in a given region. Entropy has long been used to
quantify statistical correlation (lack of statistical correlation
to be exact) in data analysis.

tumors in human breast. Baroni et al. [17] estimated the first
and second order gray level statistics through the histogram
and the co-occurrence matrices to discriminate between
different layers of retinal tissue. Lingley-Papadopoulos et
al. [18] used 74 texture features representing the three
approaches to texture analysis (statistical, structural, and
spectral) to detect bladder cancer. Linearly correlated features were removed by calculating the correlation matrix for
the feature set. Based on the results of the feature selection
process, a decision tree was created to perform classification.
Pitris et al. [19] used an autoregressive spectral estimation
to calculate the spectral density of each section of the
image. They utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to reduce the number of variables per spectrum followed by
Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) to maximize
the separation between categories before applying the kMeans algorithm.
Statistical texture analysis can provide valuable information about the physical properties of the imaged object. The
ability to consistently quantify the intensity distribution from
any arbitrary image location can provide the quantitative
means to associate image content with its corresponding
physical meaning.

In tissue characterization, feature selection is the discovery of the set of quantitative measures that can best
delineate between different types of tissues. The selection of
the optimal feature set is not a trivial problem. Early studies
utilized features similar to those employed by physicians
during their diagnoses. This is not always the best strategy
as most of these features tend to be qualitative and judgmental in nature, not particularly suitable for computerized
techniques. Another strategy is to start with a large number
of features then use a space reduction method (e.g., PCA,
ICA, MANOVA) to reduce the dimensionality of the set to
a practical size. This doesn’t always produce an applicable
feature set. In fact, it can even produce very disappointing
results since these are generic techniques that don’t consider
any specifics about the characterization problem.
Our approach to feature selection is to first investigate the
characteristics of the image textures we are trying to classify,

Our method consists of two phases. The first phase, is
a learning phase where we estimate the texture parametric
equations. In this phase, we collect large number of data
points from the three types of plaque. We fit suitable
polynomials to the data to estimate the parametric equations
that govern the relationship between the normalized variance
and the entropy for each of the plaque types as shown in
figures 3-5.
The second phase is the characterization phase. Given
an image region to characterize, we calculate the normalized variance and entropy from the given region. We call
these, the observed measures. We substitute the observed
normalized variance in the parametric equation of each of

Fibrous Plaque.

The three major atherosclerosis plaque types (fiber, calcium, and
lipid) can be identified on OCT images by comparison to histology
from the visual properties suggested by Yabushita et al. [1]. Fibrous
plaque is generally identified as homogeneous signal rich region. In
contrast, calcified plaque appears as signal poor region with sharp
upper and/or lower borders. Lipid rich regions are also recognized
as signal poor regions but with diffused borders as shown in figure
6.
Figures 3-5 show the results from the learning phase. Second
degree polynomials were fitted to the data. The quadratic equations
4, 5 and 6 represent the results of the fit for fiberous, calcified, and
lipid plaque, respectively, where 𝐸 is the entropy and 𝑣 is the
normalized variance.
Approximately, 100 different regions were manually selected
for characterization from each of the three plaque types. Due
to the relatively moderate size of our data set, we implemented
30-fold cross-validation [20] to better assess the characterization
performance of the model. Our data set were randomly partitioned
into 30 subsets where a single subset was retained as the validation
set and the remaining 29 sets were used to build the parametric
model. The cross-validation process was repeated 30 times where
each of the 30 subsets were used once as the validation set. The
resulting parameters and performance measures were then averaged
to produce the final results.
In addition to the validation set, about 30 regions were selected
from the catheter, background, and randomly generated patterns to
test the performance of the method in the presence of outliers. This
set was used in the validation at each of the 30 repetitions.
The characterization performance of the method estimated from
a 30-fold cross-validation demonstrated mean sensitivity of 100%
for fiber, 76% for calcium, and 53% for lipid with specificity of
97%, 94%, and 93% respectively. This is a considerable improvement over the currently available intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
commercial system offering the virtual histology (VH) feature.
The sensitivity of IVUS-VH for the detection of fibrous, fibrofatty, and necrotic core tissue has been shown [21] to be 76.1%,
46%, and 41.1% respectively with poor specificity. Todate, tissue
characterization has not yet been offered by any commercial OCT
systems.

the plaque types and calculate the corresponding entropy.
We find the absolute difference between the calculated
entropy and the observed entropy for each of the plaque
types. The region is labeled with a given plaque type if its
equation produces the minimum absolute difference between
the calculated and observed entropy. If this difference is
larger than the observed entropy, the region is labeled as
an outlier.

We have presented a new method for characterizing atherosclerosis plaque in intravascular OCT images. The method has demonstrated high characterization performance and stability in the presence of outliers. The proposed method is practical and easy to
implement, as well as fast enough for real time systems.
