placement by subsequently coloring the edges of the
graph through application of the principles of grouping
from Gestalt psychology. These principles derive from
the law of prägnanz, which argues that people tend to
order experience in a matter that is simple, orderly,
symmetric, and regular [3]. The principles of grouping
suggest that predictions can be made on how the mind
will interpret visual stimuli since it naturally seeks order
and patterns based on certain rules. The principles are
ordered into the following seven categories (Figure 1):
1. Proximity - elements that are close together are
perceived collectively, whereas elements that are
far apart are perceived separately.
2. Similarity - like elements are perceived
collectively, whereas differing elements are
perceived separately.
3. Closure - incomplete or partially obscured
elements tend to be completed by the mind.
4. Symmetry - elements displaying symmetry are
perceived collectively in spite of distance.
5. Continuation - when elements intersect or
overlap, each is perceived separately and as
uninterrupted.
6. Common fate - when elements are moving at the
same velocity, they are perceived collectively.
7. Figure-ground - elements can be distinguished
from their surroundings by dividing a scene into
foreground and background.

Abstract
Graphs, generally used as data structures in
computer science applications, have steadily shown a
growth in mapping various types of relationships, from
maps to computer networks to social networks. As graph
layouts and visualizations have been at the forefront of
graph drawing research for decades, it consequently led
to aesthetic heuristics that not only generated better
visualizations and aesthetically appealing graphs but
also improved readability and understanding of the
graphs. A variety of approaches examines aesthetics of
nodes, edges, or graph layout, and related readability
metrics. In this paper we focus on the edge crossing
problem and propose a solution that incorporates
Gestalt principles to improve graph aesthetics and
readability. We introduce the concept of breaks in edges
at edge crossings. A break is a gap in an edge drawing
occurring in the vicinity of an edge crossing. At every
edge crossing, one of the incident edges is broken, which
will prevent any unintentional gestalts that occur at edge
crossings that reduce the readability of a graph drawing.
We present our preliminary results and user studies that
show that this technique could play a role in improving
graph readability.

1. Introduction
Graph drawing algorithms can be qualitatively
compared by how successfully they meet certain
aesthetic requirements, such as minimizing the number
of edge crossings, minimizing the area of the drawing,
maximizing angles between edges, conformance to a
desired aspect ratio. Aesthetic requirements are
indicators of a graph drawing's readability,
understanding, and overall aesthetic value, therefore
given two drawings of a graph structure, the 'better'
drawing is more successful in meeting one or more of
these aesthetic requirements than the other.
Most graph drawing algorithms focus on placement
of the nodes constrained by the aesthetic requirements, or
proceed further. The algorithm in [1] proceeds from node

Such experimental studies as [2] provide evidence
that edge crossings are the primary inhibitor to
readability. However, not all graphs are planar so it is
impossible to guarantee that a drawing is free of edge
crossings in the general case. Therefore, we propose a
new graph drawing algorithm whose focus is on utilizing
the principle of closure to improve readability inhibited
by edge crossings. At each edge crossing, assign one
edge to be primary and the other to be secondary. The
secondary edge will then have a gap in continuity on the
portion immediately passing through the area of the edge
crossing. The primary edge is trivially easy to trace
through the area of the edge crossing, and the secondary
edge is still easily perceived as a whole edge due to the
Gestalt principle of closure. In the unusual case of
multiple edges crossing at the same point, a number of
them are assigned as primary, while the rest are assigned
as secondary, then each set is treated as in the typical
case.

3. Technical Approach
We chose an embedding algorithm with few edge
crossings that is interactive, easy to implement, and
adapt. The Force Directed Placement (FDP) [8]
algorithm meets these requirements. In FDP, the nodes
can be imagined as point masses connected by springs.
The total energy of the system is then minimized
iteratively by adjusting the lengths of the springs. The
final embedding is the minimum energy state found. The
original algorithm has a costly time complexity of O(n3),
though [9] and [10] present optimizations to produce
algorithms with a time complexity of O(n2) and [11]
further improves it with a hybrid algorithm utilizing
approximations by both sampling and interpolating,
achieving an algorithm with time complexity of O(n5/4).
A sweep line algorithm can be used to efficiently
find all edge crossings. For example, the Bentley-Ottman
algorithm [7] performs with a time complexity of O((n +
k)log n), where n is the number of edges and k is the
number of edge crossings. A simpler algorithm would be
a pairwise comparison of edges where minimum
bounding boxes are used to quickly eliminate spatially
distant edges. Although it has a poorer time complexity,
the latter option was chosen in our implementation since
it offers a natural way to select the primary and
secondary edges. We chose an implementation where the
edge being compared to all others is the secondary edge.
This choice naturally leads to the secondary edges
indexing the edge crossing positions so that intermediate
points can be easily determined using the same angle for
each by using the following formulas:

2. Background
This research furthers the work done in [1] by
investigating ways of applying Gestalt principles to a
drawing of a graph after it has been embedded in the
plane. The method in [1] relies on coloring the entire
drawing. However color is not always appropriate for
graphs or displays might be restricted to monochrome in
which case colors are not an option. Moreover, edge
crossings cannot always be avoided so other techniques
are needed and some of the Gestalt principles seem to fill
in the need. The method presented here only affects the
areas immediately around the edge crossings and can still
be employed when restricted to black-on-white drawings.
We are unaware of any other research employing edge
breaks in the graph drawing with perceptual support.
However, researchers in [4-6, 12] provide evidence of
the cognitive ability of the human mind to correctly
interpret highly distorted images or shapes, useful in
applications such as human interactive proof systems and
CAPTCHAs (Figure 2). Using the high success rate as
evidence that the humans use Gestalt principles, such as
closure, in order to interpret distorted images, we predict
that our minimal effects will not hinder readability; in
fact, we expect to enhance readability by breaking other
unintentional gestalts.

x = x ec ± r cos(θ )
y = y ec ± r sin(θ )
where (xec, yec) is an edge crossing, r is the break
radius, and ș is the angle that the secondary edge makes
with the x-axis. These intermediate points (x, y) lie on the
intersections of the break area and the secondary edge, so
that the entire edge can be represented as a series of line
segments where the first line segment starts at the parent
node's coordinates and ends at the first intermediate

point, and the last line segment starts at the last
intermediate point and ends at the child node's
coordinates (Figure 3). When the intermediate points are
being determined, some may need to be discarded if two
break areas overlap so that a line segment is not drawn in
this area. Drawing primary edges is trivial in this system
since they are represented as secondary edges with no
intersections, causing the lines to be drawn through the
intersection points creating the desired Gestalt effect
over the secondary edges with which they cross.

connected to a node chosen at random five times for each
graph and rendering. The participants were asked to rate
the ease of this task for each graph on a five-point Likert
scale, where one denotes ‘very difficult’ and five denotes
‘very easy.’ The participants were also asked to give
general feedback regarding the test at the end. Table 1
shows the results of preliminary user studies. The
columns heading include a number corresponding to the
testing figure and also identify whether that figure is
‘traditional’ (T) or has the Gestalt effect added (G) (i.e.,
4T corresponds to Figure 4 left - traditional, whereas 7G
corresponds to Figure 7 right - with breaks in edges at
edge crossings). The cells with lighter shading highlight
an improvement in readability over the traditional graphs
whereas the cells with darker shading highlight difficulty
when introducing Gestalt effect, as perceived by the
participants in our study.

More qualitative data has been recorded through the
general feedback on the exit survey. Out of the 14
participants, 13 left feedback of which one did not relate
to the study. Three of them felt that the gaps were
distracting and aesthetically unpleasing making the tasks
more difficult whereas two felt that the gaps made the
graph more aesthetically pleasing though had no impact
on the difficulty of the tasks. Three felt that the breaks
were distracting in sparse drawings but were very
effective in densely clustered drawings, while another
four had no preference for either rendering after the
study. These preliminary tests are encouraging especially
for the graph drawings with clusters of edge crossings or
larger graph drawings.
In future work, considering some of the feedback
received in the initial study, we will perform more tests
in which edge crossings must meet certain requirements
before a gap is introduced. Such requirements may be
local node density, angle at which edges intersect,
number of edge crossings on a single edge, and whether
gaps have already been introduced on an edge.

edge crossings that incorporates Gestalt
principles.

4. User Study
The program presented in [1] has been adapted to
incorporate the new approach we described for rendering
the graph. Various graphs were drawn using our
program. Each was rendered with and without the gestalt
effect (Figure 4-7). We were also interested in the effect
of our approach when applied to a graph with fewer edge
crossings vs. very large number of edge crossings. A
preliminary study was performed with fourteen
participants having various educational backgrounds.
Each participant were shown the four testing figures, in
the order shown, and asked to identify all nodes

5. Conclusions
We present a method that uses Gestalt principle of
closure for increasing graph drawings aesthetics and
readability, by introducing gaps into a graph at every
edge crossing. Similar Gestalt principles applied as
deformations to handwriting samples or shapes have
been proven to work well without altering human
recognition abilities. We adapted the FDP algorithm to
accommodate these gaps as part of the secondary edges
when crossing primary edges.
We conducted a preliminary study to collect
evidence that our hypothesis holds merit. Initial results
and user feedback have been promising and provided
important information for our future work. We consider
conducting additional studies in the future on adding
gaps at edge crossings after certain requirements are met.
Additional experiments will be considered by varying the
size of the edge breaks in order to determine any
influence on graph readability.
