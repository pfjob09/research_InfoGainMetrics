study results.

Abstract— We tested the visual sensitivity of 15 healthy
subjects under scotopic vision using flickering stimulus on the
Liquid crystal display (LCD) with a light-emitting diode (LED)
backlight (LED-LCD) panel. This test was made to know; 1) if
LED-LCD panel might be used for the visual stimulation
under scotopic vision, and 2) the minimum trials for ensemble
average to get visually evoked potential (VEP). Green, Blue,
and Red colors were tested in the darkroom.
Electroencephalogram electrodes were used. The brightness of
each color was degraded into 255 steps. All participants were
asked to watch a circle with red, green, and blue color on the
LED-LCD panel. As a result, VEP showed a well-known
response pattern when the signals were ensemble averaged for
50 trials. The peak of VEP was not much changed after 25
trials. LED-LCD panel was simple and useful for the simple
visual stimulation to test VEP.

Ease of Use
A.

Participants
EEG was recorded from 15 healthy subjects (aged from
21 to 54: male = 8, female =7) who have no visual and
mental problem on their clinical history. No one was color
blind or night blind. All participants were asked not to drink
and to sleep enough before the test. Five minutes were given
before the main test in the dark room to make them adjust to
the room after attaching EEG electrodes. The intra-individual
difference and inter-individual difference were checked for
visually evoked potential (VEP) patterns for the same color
and different colors.

INTRODUCTION

B. Electroencephalogram record
EEG electrodes were attached according to 10/20
international electrode system: Oz for active signal, A1 and
A2 for reference, Fz for ground, and Fp1 and Fp2 for eye
blink. The maximum impedance between electrodes was
maintained less than 5 k:. Sampling rate was 512 samples
per second.

At different light levels, the mechanisms of human vision
are different. Under the typical during the day (photopic
vision) cone cells in the eye are used to process light. Rod
cells are used to see objects under very low light levels
(scotopic vision) [1]. A combination between photopic
vision and scotopic vision is known for mesopic vision
which is not quite bright but not quite dark. In human eyes,
luminance level of photopic, mesopic, and scotopic vision
range from 1 to 106 cd/m2, 10-2 to 1 cd/m2, and 10-2 to 10-6
cd/m2 each.
In 1924, CIE (International Commission on Illumination)
defined the photopic spectral sensitivity function V (O) of a
human being. In 1951, CIE defined the scotopic efficiency
function V’(O) [2]. However, till now, no mesopic luminous
efficiency function is defined officially [3-4]. In addition,
functions defined before for photopic and scotopic vision
were not objective but subjective.
In this study, we used electroencephalogram (EEG) to get
objective data from the brain response to flickering visual
stimulation. Before applying the idea using LED-LCD panel
to mesopic vision, we tested this system for scotopic vision
as a pilot study. Especially, EEG recording using simple test
equipment such as a LED-LCD panel and computer program
was very handy for the quantitative analysis for the

METHODS

C. Visual stimulation system
Visual stimulation system consisted of two parts: LEDLCD panel and a computer program for providing flickers to
participants. The resolution of the LED-LCD panel (376 x
301 mm, 19ȁ) was 1280 x 1024 pixels with 2 ms response
time. The radiance and luminance ranged from 3x10-4 to
8x10-2 [W·sr-1·m-2] and from 0.08 to 43.4 [cd·m-2]
respectively. A computer program was made and used for
flickering stimulation purpose. Each red, green, and blue
color of the target was chosen selectively. The brightness of
each color was degraded into 255 steps and the computer
program displayed it on the LED-LCD monitor for each step.
We found the optimized flickering time interval was 1 s for
onset and 3 s for offset. Participants were asked to watch the
LED-LCD monitor until a circle is appearing and to rest for

448

three seconds for offset period. Two or three preliminary
tests were made until a participant is getting used to the
system before the main tests (Fig. 1).

RESULTS

Figure 2 Visually evoked potential (VEP): single trial (top) and ensemble
averaged signals (25, 50, and 75 trials). The vertical axis is for amplitude of
VEP (PV) and horizontal axis is the latency of positive or negative peaks of
VEP (ms)

A. Visually evoked potential (VEP)
VEP showed clearly a well-known response pattern when
the signals were integrated for 50 trials (Fig. 2). Ensemble
average showed the typical VEP patterns after 25 trials or
more.

TABLE I.

The intra-individual difference and inter-individual
difference of VEP patterns for the same color and different
colors were not always consistent. For an example, a
participant showed that the peaks for red color and green
were decreased when two records were compared few day
time gap, but increased N1 and P1 for blue color (Table 1).
In some cases, we could not get any consistent results from
the same participants.

Please see the figure 2 for P1, N1, and P2.

There were no significant or distinguished pattern
differences among colors for intra-individuals. However, the
peak latency varies severely even for the same color and for
the same observer. The VEP pattern varies severely among
inter observer in the same color as well as in the different
colors. VEP varied approximately from -10 μV to + 15 μV.

DISCUSSION

In this study, 15 participants were enrolled for the
visually evoked potential using EEG system and LED-LCD
monitor with a computer program.
Based on the traditional method of measuring light, to
measure the photopic (or scotopic) luminous efficiency
function of the human vision, a participant was supposed to
using a button to press or made a sign to indicate the moment
they recognized the color. We may collect objective data if
we could consistent VEP results from the test.
For the moment, few participants showed consistent
results and many of them did not show consistent results by
stimulating colors on LED-LCD panel. Yet, the reason could
not be explained from this pilot study. In addition, the
patterns of VEP for the same color between trials within a

449

participant were not showing any significant different
patterns either. The variation may be caused by different
viewing angle or ages.
The prediction of visual performance of a human is
getting important matters to industries. To make a
standardized testing protocol for the objective evaluation of
the visual ability and sensitivity, further study should be
made.

CONCLUSIONS

We recorded visually evoked potential from 15
participants. Ensemble average more than 25 trials may show
typical VEP patterns. LED-LCD monitor may be used as a
preliminary tool to get luminous efficiency function.
