Abstract- Uterine Cervical Cancer is one of the most common
forms of cancer in women worldwide. Most cases of cervical
cancer can be prevented through screening programs aimed at
detecting precancerous lesions. During Digital Colposcopy,
colposcopic images or cervigrams are acquired in raw form.
They contain specular reflections which appear as bright spots
heavily saturated with white light and occur due to the
presence of moisture on the uneven cervix surface and. The
cervix region occupies about half of the raw cervigram image.
Other parts of the image contain irrelevant information, such
as equipment, frames, text and non-cervix tissues. This
irrelevant information can confuse automatic identification of
the tissues within the cervix. Therefore we focus on the cervical
borders, so that we have a geometric boundary on the relevant
image area. Our novel technique eliminates the SR, identifies
the region of interest and makes the cervigram ready for
segmentation algorithms.

to process images acquired in colposcopy. Nevertheless,
trained personnel are required for evaluation of the results.

Uterine Cervical Cancer is one of the most common form of
Cancer in women worldwide, and 80% of cases occur in the
developing world, where very few resources exist for
management[1]. Most cases of cervical cancer can be
prevented through screening programs aimed at detecting
precancerous lesions. Screening for cervical neoplasia using
the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, followed by colposcopy,
biopsy, and treatment of neoplastic lesions has dramatically
reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in
every country in which organized programs have been
established[2]. This is due to the fact that the precursors,
denoted as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or
squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) can take 3 to 20 yr to
develop into cancer. However, due to lack of resources and
infrastructure, 238,000 women die every year of cervical
cancer; more than 80% of these deaths occur in developing
countries[1],[3]. We are interested in applying optical
technologies to replace expensive infrastructure for cervical
cancer screening in the developing world. The use of direct
visual inspection (DVI), visual inspection with acetic acid
(VIA), and visual inspection with Lugol’s iodine (VILI) are
being explored as alternatives to Pap smear and colposcopic
examination in many developing countries[4]-[8]. Recent
reviews of the performance of these methods found that they
have sufficient sensitivity and specificity, when performed
by trained professionals, to serve as viable alternatives to
Pap screening in low-resource settings[9]-[10]. The results
of a review by Sankaranarayanan[11] favorably compares
these methods for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and
conventional cytology. Because DVI relies on visual
interpretation, it is crucial to define objective criteria for the
positive identification of a lesion and to train personnel to
correctly implement a program based on these criteria.
Denny et al.[10] noted that restricting the definition of a
positive VIA test to a well-defined acetowhite lesion
significantly improved specificity, while reducing
sensitivity. In a series of 1921 women screened in Peru,
Jeronimo et al found that the DVI false positivity rate
dropped from 13.5% in the first months to 4% during

INTRODUCTION

Uterine Cervical Cancer is one of the most common forms
of cancer in woman worldwide. It is ranked 11th in
incidence and 13th in mortality in the developed countries,
due to the ability to detect the precancerous lesions through
government-sponsored Cervical Cancer Screening Program.
This success in the developed countries has been achieved
through a synergy between Cervical Cytology Screening for
Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia (CIN) before they
become invasive and their effective treatment directed by
colposcopy.
Colposcopy is a very effective, non-invasive diagnostic tool.
In colposcopy, the cervix is examined non-invasively by a
colposcope which is a specially designed binocular stereomicroscope. The abnormal cervical regions turn to be white
after application of 5% acetic acid and are called
Acetowhite (AW) lesions which are then biopsied under
colposcopic guidance for confirmation by histopathological
examination. Modern colposcopes can produce a digital
image of the cervix. Colposcopy today is considered the
gold standard for detection and treatment of pre-cancerous
lesions of the cervix. However, there is currently a void in
specialized image processing software which has the ability

subsequent months of a 2-yr study; the drop in positivity
rate was hypothesized to be due to a learning curve for the
evaluator[12]. Bomfim-Hyppolito et al. investigated the use
of cervicography as an adjunct to DVI. A simple Sony
digital camera was used to photograph the cervix before and
after the application of acetic acid[13]. Photographs were
later interpreted by an expert colposcopist. The addition of
cervicography improved both sensitivity and specificity.
However, this approach prevents the implementation of seeand-treat strategies in low resource settings because of the
need for expert review.
Recently, optical techniques have been investigated as
alternative detection methods in a quantitative and objective
manner. Several studies have demonstrated that optical
spectroscopy has the potential to improve the screening and
diagnosis of neoplasia. Ferris et al. studied multimodal
hyperspectral imaging for the noninvasive diagnosis of
cervical neoplasia[14]. They reported a sensitivity of 97%
and a specificity of 70%. Huh et al. [15] measured the
performance of optical detection of HGSIL using
fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy, finding a
sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 70%. As another
promising application of optical techniques for cervical
cancer screening, a number of studies investigated whether
digital image processing techniques could be used to
automate the interpretation of colposcopic images[14]-[19].
Craine and Craine[16] introduced a digital colposcopy
system for archiving images and visually assessing features
in the images. Shafi et al.[17] and Cristoforoni et al.[18]
used a digital imaging system for colposcopy, which
enables image capture and simple processing. To assess
various colposcopic features, the acquired images were
manually analyzed by an expert. By examining the
relationship between colposcopic features and histology
outcomes, Shafi et al.’s study provided information about
features that are most useful to the expert observer.
Image interpretation in these early studies mainly relied on
experts’ qualitative assessment of colposcopic images and
provided limited quantitative analysis. Li et al. developed a
computer-aided diagnostic system using colposcopic
features such as acetowhitening changes, lesion margin, and
blood vessel structures[19]. They prototyped image
processing algorithms for detection of those features and
showed promising preliminary results. However, the
diagnostic performance of the system has not been reported.
Recently, advances in consumer electronics have led to
inexpensive, high-dynamic-range charge-coupled device
(CCD) cameras with excellent low light sensitivity. At the
same time, advances in vision chip technology enable high
quality image processing in real time. Moreover, automated
analysis algorithms based on modern image processing
techniques have the potential to replace clinical expertise,
which may reduce the cost of screening.
The purpose of the paper is to present an image
preprocessing method to remove specular reflection and
detect ROI.
Several challenges for diagnostic digital colposcopic image
analysis remain. First, previous studies have investigated

only a few features and have not taken advantage of the
mature field of image analysis and computer-automated
techniques. Second, previous studies have compared image
features of selected normal and abnormal areas of the
cervix, but have not applied the approach to the entire image
to identify whether lesions are present. Finally, previous
studies have used biopsies from selected areas as the gold
standard. A gold standard is necessary for the entire field of
view to address the issue of lesion localization.

AUTOMATED SYSTEM

An automated system is proposed in this paper that is used
for diagnosis of CIN. The scheme is presented as a block
diagram in Fig. 1. The process of translating raw cervix
image acquired using a Digital Colposcope into a thorough
diagnosis of CIN is decomposed into four modules: 1)
removal of specular reflection (SR) from raw cervigrams; 2)
segmentation of cervix region of interest (ROI); 3)
segmentation of cervix ROI into acetowhite (AW),
columnar epithelium (CE) and squamous epithelium (SE);
4) classification of AW regions into AW, mosaic, or
punctation tiles; However, we are presenting the first two
modules in this paper.
A. Algorithms for Segmentation
Salient features observed in cervical images consist of the
cervix ROI, SR, AW, SE, and CE. While the AW region is
the single most important region for detecting the presence
and extent of CIN, the ROI must also be extracted. SR,
which adversely affects the AW segmentation process, must
be removed. During the AW segmentation procedure, the
CE and SE are designated as distinct regions. The
classification process of these macro features constitutes the
first three modules of the automated diagnosis system
illustrated in Fig. 1.

Specular Reflections (SR) appear as bright spots heavily
saturated with white light. These occur due to the presence

of moisture on the uneven cervix surface, which act like
mirrors reflecting the light from the illumination source.
Apart from camouflaging the actual features, the SR also
affects subsequent segmentation routines and hence must be
removed. At first, the RGB Image (Raw Cervigram) is
separated into Red, Green and Blue Planes. The Specular
Reflections (White Areas) are identified by selecting the
white pixels from each plane and logically AND -ing them.
Standard Morphological methods viz. dilation is used that
utilize a structuring element (SE). Once the dilated binary
images with outlines are identified, the borders of all the
reflections on the original grayscale image using the
coordinates are returned. A filling Algorithm is used which
smoothly interpolates inward from the pixels on the
boundary of the polygon (White SR Areas) by solving
Laplace's equation. The idea is to find an interpolating
function y that satisfies Laplace’s equation in n dimensions,
ǻy = 0 where ǻ is the Laplace operator
and its homogenous version, Poisson’s equation -ǻy = f.
We also say a function y satisfying Laplace’s equation is a
harmonic function.
Now we try to find the fundamental solution. Consider
n
n
Laplace’s equation in R , ǻy = 0 x € R
There are a lot of functions y which satisfy this equation. In
particular any constant function is harmonic. In addition,
any function of the form y(x) = a1x1 +…+anxn for constants
ai is also a solution. However here we are interested in
finding a particular solution of the Laplace’s equation which
will allow us to solve Poisson’s equation. Given the
symmetric nature of Laplace’s equation, we search for a
radial solution. That is we look for a harmonic function y on
n
R such that y(x) = z(|x|). In addition to being an automatic
choice due to the symmetry of Laplace’s equation, radial
solutions are automatic to look for because they reduce a
PDE to an ODE, which is easier to solve. Therefore we look
for a radial solution.

satisfies ǻy(x) = 0 for x ് 0, but at x = 0, ǻy(0) is undefined.
The reason for choosing Laplace’s equation (among all
possible partial differential equations, say) is that the
solution to Laplace’s equation selects the smoothest
possible interpolant.

B. Cervix ROI Segmentation
The cervix region involves about half of the cervigram
image. Other parts of the image contain irrelevant
information, such as equipment, frames, text, and noncervix tissues. This irrelevant information can confuse the
automatic identification of the tissues within the cervix. The
first step is, therefore, focusing on the cervical borders, so
that we have a geometric bound on the relevant image area.
The cervix region is a relatively pink region located around
the image center. The reason for choosing the Lab Color
space (among all other color models) as it is display device
independent and conducive to human perception.
The Lab color space is derived from CIE XYZ tristimulus
values. The Lab space consists of a luminosity layer ‘L’,
chromaticity layer a indicating where color falls along redgreen axis, and chromaticity layer b indicating where color
falls along blue-yellow axis. All of the color information is
in ‘a’ and ‘b’ values. The difference between two colors
using Euclidean distance metric can be measured. Now the
cervigram consists of distinct SE, CE & AW Regions which
are relevant to our context. Hence we need to segment them
using a Clustering Algorithm.
Clustering is a way to separate groups of objects. Clustering
in pattern recognition is the process of partitioning a set of
pattern vectors into subsets called clusters. The general
problem in clustering is to partition a set of vectors into
groups having similar values.
In traditional clustering there are K clusters C1,C2,….,CK
with means m1, m2,….,mK
K-means clustering treats each object as having a location in
space. It finds partitions such that objects within each
cluster are as close to each other as possible, and as far from
objects in other clusters as possible. The K-means
algorithm[23] is a simple, iterative hill-climbing method
which can be expressed as follows.

Applying the above algorithm, the Cervigram Image is
segmented. When the resulting ROI consists of several
disjoint areas in the image, the largest one is chosen, and the
others are ignored. The image is cropped to include the ROI
region, and subsequent steps of the process are performed
within it, thus avoiding the confusing patterns and colors
that occupy the rest of the image.

RESULTS

We have taken a dataset of 210 Normal cervigrams and 42
Acetowhite cervigrams. On visual inspection by Gynecooncologists of previous research results [19]-[21], our
method of removal of specular reflection is far better, as it
smoothly interpolates using our algorithm. Previous
methods have considered only replacing the specular
reflections by blobs.
V.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have presented an image preprocessing
method to remove specular reflection and detect ROI for
further detection of acetowhite lesions from the cervigram.
The first two modules as proposed in our model has given
satisfactory results. The work on next two modules is
ongoing. Future scope of this research is to explore whether
digital colposcopy, combined with recent advances in
camera technology and automated image processing, could
provide an inexpensive alternative to Pap screening and
conventional colposcopy.
