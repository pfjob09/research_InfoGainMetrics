involvement of offenders whether they committed the
same crime together. This information is obtained from
arrest records (a relational database table) by querying
co-occurrences of offenders. Although there are widely
accepted social network based methods for group
detection, we used graph theoretical strongly connected
components (SCC) algorithm [3] at GDM.

Abstract
A link mining study on a theft network is done in
cooperation with Bursa Police Department in Turkey on
more than 100.000 crimes and 6.000 persons. Group
Detection Model (GDM) is based on co-occurrences of
offenders in police arrest records for generating possible
theft networks. Out of thousands of groups detected, only
63 ad-hoc theft groups are selected and introduced to the
police experts. To evaluate these findings, one theft
network is focused, a preliminary judge decision is
obtained for phone tapping and group members phone
conversations are eavesdropped for ten weeks. After
verification of evidences, Operation Cash is launched.
The police arrested 17 people, recovered worth $200.000
of stolen goods, and cash worth $180.000. Conviction
and evidence showed that ruling members in offender
networks can be detected using GDM. GDM uses a
graph generative model and Social Network Analysis
(SNA) for link mining in crime data.

1. Introduction
Link mining is a newly emerging research area
which is at the intersection of link analysis, hypertext
and web mining, graph mining and social network
analysis (SNA) [1]. Link mining in particular attracted
attention from a wide audience from the police
investigations. As a result of this attention, the police and
intelligence agencies realized that knowledge about
offender networks is important to crime investigation [2].
However, mining offender network data is still a manual
process, usually consuming so much time and human
effort. Specific software such as Analyst Notebook [4],
and Sentient Data Detective [5] provide visual
representation of networks as graphs with spatiotemporal aspects, but they lack automated offender group
detection. In this paper, following contributions are
made;
• In order to solve visualising theft groups a
compact graph generative model and a group
detection model is offered (section 2).
• SNA methods such as friendship identification,
finding key actors made possible (section 3).

Figure 2 Graph Generative Model
The generative model we used in Operation Cash is
exhibited in figure 2. Benefiting from unique crime
reference numbers for every crime case (C_ID), person
id’s (P_ID) are represented as nodes and every crime that
two persons committed together is represented as links.
If there are more than one crime that two persons
committed together, count of links is reflected as link
weight (w). For instance, the group we used in Operation
Cash primarily consisted of three leaders as exhibited in
figure 3. This triad of thieves committed various crimes
together. The person in the top left has committed 15
crimes together (W=15) with the person in the left
bottom and 5 crimes together (W=5) with the person in
the right bottom. The person on the left bottom has also
committed 10 crimes together (W=10) with the person
on the right bottom. Overall, these three persons have
committed 3 crimes together as a group which is shown
in crime reference numbers 82224, 82388, and 80784
highligted in red. With the friends of this triad, Operation
Cash group is detected as exhibited in figure 4.

2. Generative and Group Detection Model
For Operation Cash we used Group Detection Model
(GDM), as exhibited in figure 1, which is based on a
generative model (figure 2) and looks for common

to get only 7 ruling members in our link mining study.
Four of them; the chief of gun/jewellers thieves (12113),
the thief specialized in electronic goods (277801), chief
of electronic goods thieves (38594), chief of car/gadget
supplier (41211) are exhibited in Figure 5 and 6.

At Bursa Police Department in Turkey out of
100.000 crimes and 6.000 offenders, 63 emerging theft
networks are presented to police. To evaluate these
findings, one theft network is focused, a preliminary
judge decision is obtained for phone tapping and group
members phone conversations are eavesdropped for ten
weeks. After verification of all members and evidences,
Operation Cash is launched. The police arrested 17
people, recovered worth $200.000 of stolen goods, and
cash worth $180.000.

Interestingly, “big brother” of the network (220868) has
only two records in police database. Although we
detected him in the network, but his leader position is
identified after interrogations and cross examination of
members’ statements.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion the model used for detecting theft
networks in Bursa Turkey, has reflected positive results
for identifying ruling members of theft networks. This
model can be further developed by adding spatiotemporal aspect to it, as well as gathering similar crime
committing possible offenders to the same offender
group.

3. Evaluation
According to our initial findings 34 offenders are
considered to be in a single offender group where 7 of
them were ruling members. It has been proved that the
real network was consisting of 20 members and 3 of
them had never been arrested by the police so their
