Abstract

information from the voter in terms of candidates whom
they felt also matched their interest. However, in elections
with larger fields of candidates, collecting this information
may be prohibitively time consuming.
Fortunately, in many political situations, many candidates are quite similar in their stances, and their position
variance is further limited through expectations carried by
party affiliations. It should be possible in some instances
to express the variety of candidate position similarity in a
lower dimension map, and solicit voter-candidate proximity in a simpler and more direct fashion by asking voters
to simply select their position on a map of candidates. In
this fashion, more voter-candidate proximity data could be
collected at once.
Our work focuses on comparing voter perception of
candidate proximity in this fashion by using a participant
study. Rather than comparing the voter behavior (the casting of a vote for a single candidate out of many) to the
prediction of the model, we analyze how a potential voter
chooses to position themselves implicitly through the comparison of candidate and participant issue stances, as well
as explicitly through an analysis of their chosen positioning
in the midst of a two dimensional 'map' arrangement of
candidates. We also focus on exploring differences in political stance (individuals who identify themselves as 'very
liberal' to 'very conservative.')

The process of voting for a candidate involves selecting
an individual who best matches a personal system of values and beliefs. Typically, voters must select a candidate
whom they believe fits their issue stances best by determining their approximate similarity to the candidates on the
issues, and cognitively positioning themselves amongst the
candidates. We show in the context of our candidate position data that the intrinsic dimensionality of candidate
similarity in our data can be sufficiently expressed algorithmically in two dimensions using Gower similarity and
Sammon mapping. A participant study analyzes how voters
choose to position themselves on this low dimensional representation, and how this positioning is related to the position dictated by their actual responses to issues, as well as
to their general political stance.

1 Introduction
Political theorists have attempted to explain the behavior of voters by using spatial models of voter choice.
These spatial models have their basis in work by Howard
Hotelling who studied the equilibrium of spatial economic
competition in the late 1920s. This theory was brought
into the political sphere first by Downs [1], who proposed
spatial voting theory as a model for explaining electoral
choice on the basis of voter to candidate (or party) proximity. According to Downs, this proximity was determined
by a minimal distance between positions on one or more
ordinal 'policy continuums' (e.g., a continuous set of income tax rates) held by both the voter and potential candidate. A simple Euclidean or Manhattan distance calculation expresses the voter-candidate proximity, which then
predicts the vote for a given voter (A full discussion of spatial voting theory is beyond the scope of this article, please
see [2] for more information).
Spatial voting theory works well at expressing a voter to
candidate proximity in many political contexts. However,
since voters typically only select one candidate in a conventional election, the validation information for the model
is sparse. It would be far better to solicit more 'proximity'

2 Data Collection
In order to generate the low dimensional representation of candidate positions, a wide range of
candidate issue stances were gathered and verified
from two online sources, http://www.2decide.com. and
http://www.ontheissues.org. The 2decide.com website
provided a consistent classification of topics, candidates,
and responses for the candidates, while ontheissues.org site
provided further validation and extended information on
the candidates themselves. Our data includes responses
from the following list of ten candidates: Hillary Clinton,
John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Gravel, Mike Huckabee, Dennis Kucinich, John McCain, Barack Obama, Ron
Paul, and Mitt Romney.
Furthermore, changes in candidate positions were de-

63

tected and saved where possible. This resulted in two candidates holding two positions in the map; One before and
after they changed their mind on a given topic. Clinton and
Edwards exhibited a shift in issue stance!. The candidates'
responses were collected for the following issues:

Data Preparation

The resulting mixed ordinal data are then processed into
a Gower dissimilarity matrix. Gower's ordinal dissimilarity [3, 4] is defined as :
(I)

Roe v. Wade
Death Penalty
Education: No Child Left Behind
Embryonic Stem Cells: Legalization of Research
Energy & Oil: Pursue ANWR Drilling
Energy & Oil: Adopt Kyoto Protocol
Guns: Assault Weapons Ban
Guns: Background Checks for Handguns
Homeland Security: Patriot Act
Homeland Security: Guantanamo
Homeland Security: Waterboarding (torture)
Homeland Security: Domestic Wiretapping
Immigration: Citizenship Path for I1Iegals
Immigration: Border Fence
Internet Neutrality
Iran: Sanctions
Iran: Military Action as Option
Iraq: Initial Invasion Justified
Iraq: Troop Surge
Iraq: Withdrawal
Minimum Wage Increase
Same-Sex: Marriage
Same-Sex: Civil Union
Same-Sex: Constitutional Ban
Universal Healthcare

Where Tho is the range of the values for the k th variable,
depending on the validity/existence of the variable under
comparison. Any missing information was not included in
the calculation of the Gower similarity. The Gower dissimilarity was performed for each candidate pair, which
created a dissimilarity matrix D that expresses the degree
to which each candidate is related to every other candidate
according to their similarity in position stances.

4

Dimensional Candidate Analysis

Sammon mapping was applied to the Gower dissimilarity matrix in order to express the candidate relational information in two dimensions[5]. Sammon maps optimize an
error function E by following a steepest-descent iterative
process:

Where d ij * is each element of the Gower dissimilarity
matrix D from above, and d ij is the embedding of each
candidate in the two dimensional output space. When embedded in two dimensions, the candidate dissimilarity data
had an error of 0.0 II (~ 1 %) well below the error tolerance
for dimensional scaling. Furthermore, only 16 out of 250
possible candidate responses were missing, and the layout
was consistent.
Figure 1 shows the top two dimensions of dissimilarity as the x and y axis, respectively. Candidate positions
are labeled with their last names, and previously held positions (by Clinton and Edwards) are colored grey. The
distribution of candidates exposes the expected separation
between Democratic and Republican party stances. Huckabee, McCain, and other Republican candidates are clustered towards the right side of the plot, while the democratic candidates are all positioned to the left.
It is worth noting that the orientation of the plot axes
are somewhat arbitrary. Subsequent versions of the plot of
Figure I may be inverted through either axis. Therefore,
the candidate orientation (whether they show on the left or
right side) is arbitrary, but their position relative to the rest
of the candidates will not change 2 .

The issue response types were coded as ordinal variables of different types, corresponding to the nature of response required by the question. The ranking of the variables in each type reflect an increasing difference of stance
on the given issue. There were two special types used for
coding Iraq war positions and same sex marriage positions.
All others use the 'Default' type. The following is list of
the ordinal variable types:
• Default: Supports < Mixed Opinion < Opposes.
• Iraq war withdrawal: Immediate Withdrawal <
Supports Phased Withdrawal < Opposes.
• Same sex marriage/union: Supports < Supports
but believes the issues should be left to the states.
< Mixed opinion < Opposes but believes the issue
should be left to the states < Opposes.

1Edwards and Clinton both changed their 'Iraq War: Initial Invasion Justi lied' stance rrom 'Oppose' to 'Support'.
2por instance, the existence of the 'leftist' democratic party position on the left hand side of the plot is completely (and conveniently) coincidental.

Once the participants have selected their personal
stances on the issues and indicated their personal relevance, their results are saved and added to the responses for
the candidates. Then, the same Gower similarity and Sammon mapping process was run on their responses plus the
original candidate responses. In order to ensure the similarity and mapping processes could be completed successfully, participants were required to answer all but 3 questions of their choosing.
After successfully completing the questionnaire, participants were then shown the results of the mapping process,
with their own calculated location hidden. This interface
is shown in Figure 3. They were then asked to position
an indicator icon (the large orange circular icon in the upper left corner) near the candidate whom they thought best
matched their stance on the issues.
The participants were not given any information on how
the candidates were positioned, nor what the dimensions
represented. Several candidates dropped out of the race
during the course of the study, but the participants were instructed to consider these candidates as active even if they
were no longer actually viable in the election. After dragging and dropping the indicator icon and confirming their
position, they were shown their 'actual' position calculated
by the mapping process shown in Figure 4.

Figure I: Sammon map of candidate issue similarity.
The second (y) dimension of Figure I is based on a level
of 'governmental intervention' in the form of federal legislation. Ron Paul, on the bottom of this dimension, exemplifies the non-interventionist stance, opposing Federal legislation on nearly every issue - preferring instead to leave
many issues to the state governments. Rudolph Giuliani
lies on the other end of the dimension, supporting a larger
variety of federal legislation. The unit of distance shown in
the axes is a shifted and scaled version of the raw distance
information. This was done in order to fit a roughly 500 by
300 pixel display applet. All distances referenced in this
paper are expressed in this proportionally scaled form for
consistency.
A call for participation was announced via e-mail
and on various online political message boards. Participants were directed to the study website located at
http://www.candidatemapper2008.net. In total, around
150 individuals participated and submitted their responses
along with their demographic information. After providing the demographic information, they were instructed to
fill out a questionnaire survey, measuring their stance on
the same twenty-five issues that were gathered from the
presidential candidates.
A portion of this questionnaire interface is shown in
Figure 2. In this interface, acceptable answers are given in
a drop down list under 'Personal Stance'. 'Personal Relevance' drop down selections indicate the importance of the
issue to the individual. However, relevance information
was not directly included in any of the results presented
in this study. Issue topic titles are hyperlinks to relevant
wikipedia entries on the subject.

Figure 4 shows the 'calculated' personal position in
green and labeled 'YOU'. The original large indicator icon
indicated that the selected position is locked and can no
longer be moved. The participants were then encouraged
to click and explore the map. By clicking on each candidate, as well as their own selected position, they could
compare their position and responses to the candidates using the candidate information panel (which is now visible
at this point) shown in Figure 5. Participants were also able
to click on links to visit the candidate's web site, or explore
the candidate positions in more depth using the ontheissues.org website.

Participant Study Analysis

The calculated and selected sets of participant positions were gathered and analyzed. The distance between
these positions indicate a form of 'error' in their judgement of position. In our study, the magnitude of this distance was related to their demographic information, most
notably their main political leaning, which is referred to
as a general 'participant stance' (from very liberal to very
conservative) in the following results. Tables 1 and 2 show
the summary statistics and inter-group t-test significance
levels respectively. Unfortunately, there were not enough
'very conservative' individuals to consider this group. Figure 6 shows the mean distributions of distances (with error
bars of length 2*stderr) for each general participant stance.
Several of the seven participant political stance groups
have non-overlapping error bars. Additionally, the t-test
values indicate that some political stances are different
with at least a 90% confidence level, with others approaching significance.
The data seem to suggest that liberals have a better
awareness of their candidate similarity since their error distances are lower. However, this is not necessarily true. The
democratic candidates had fewer variations in their stances
than the republican candidates, and this lead to tighter relative clustering in the map of all candidates, making it easier
for liberal participants to guess their position.

Whereas the liberal participants had consistently
smaller distance errors, they also had more consistency
with the direction of their error, particularly on the liberalto-conservative x axis. After separating out the distances
into their x and y components, it is possible to characterize the nature of the distance error in terms of the dimensions of the map (the liberal-to-conservative dimension,
and the governmental intervention dimension). Figure 7
shows a boxplot of the distribution of differences along the
x 'liberal-to-conservative' axis. The majority (the portion
of distribution in the box covering the first through third
quartiles) of most liberal groups had a distance error in
the x dimension, and this error was almost always negative
(meaning that they should've positioned themselves further
to the left, towards more liberal candidates like Kucinich
or Gravel). The liberal participants did not show the same
consistency in their y dimensional error, with many of the
quartile boxes centered on or overlapping O. The conservative participants did not have a consistent direction of x or
y dimension error (except for the marginal 'very conservative' group).
Figure 9 superimposes all participant positions onto the
original candidate map. Each point in the plot is a selected
position by a study participant. An arrow line extends from
the point to their position calculated through the Sammon
mapping method. The line is colored blue to red according
to the political stance indicated by the participant. Each
candidate is indicated by a text label over their general position. Since each participant has a candidate map generated especially for their responses, very small differences
in candidate positioning occurred. This was not enough to
affect the general layout of the candidates in a meaningful
way, and we use text labels for candidate positions instead
of precise points because of this.

Conclusions

The candidate mapping process provides a method of
directly comparing spatial voting methods to a cognitive
approach using explicit positioning. It has uncovered discrepancies in voter explicit and implicit positioning, and is
able to express this error in terms of the predominant political sensibilities (the liberal-to-conservative, and interventionist dimensions of the map).
There is a significant and consistent error in the positioning of liberal participants. The basis for this error
in the participants (largely twenty to thirty year old graduate and undergraduate students) point to the popularity
of Barack Obama. Several participants were surprised to
learn of his stance on same-sex marriage (opposes), and the
death penalty (supports). With all issues being equal, and
no other concerns to bear, the liberal participants would
have found better matches with candidates who had a more
liberal position on the map.

In general, the idea of 'who is the more liberal or conservative' candidates is difficult to answer, because the
idea (or relevancy) of what a liberal or conservative is can
change. Ron Paul's platform highlights the changes that
have occurred in the Republican party. In terms of candidate similarity, Ron Paul is an 'outlier,' and very dissimilar
from most other candidates. However, his philosophy towards federal governance reflects the ideals that the party
was founded under (to minimize federal involvement in legal matters, and let states decide things for themselves).
His distance from his peers reflects the change in party attitudes.
Expressing candidate-voter similarity in the manner described here helps not only to describe the predominant
political sensibilities, but also helps to better understand

stances, or in the characterization of their behavior according to spatial voting theory.

9 Future Work
The technique described in this work only touches on
one of the spatial voting approaches. The other predominant form, known as 'directional' spatial voting addresses
the concept of 'issue relevance weights' , which emphasizes
the importance of certain issues over others for a given
voter [6]. This approach was not discussed here because
it was not conducive towards large scale visualization, but
is an area for future work for this method.
Furthermore, this approach is not necessarily limited to
the political sphere. Other tasks involving personal discernment of a cultural sensibility could be viable domains
for this approach, given the underlying basis of the information is conducive for quantitative judgements of similarity and low dimensional representations for visualization.
