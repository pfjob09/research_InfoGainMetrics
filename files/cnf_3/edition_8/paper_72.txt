Abstract
The network map of the London Underground is often
put forward as a good example of information visualisation.
Certainly this style of metro map has been adopted in many
cities to assist train travellers understand the various routes
and network connections. This paper reports on a
preliminary investigation into the question: Can the metro
map metaphor be adapted for effectively displaying more
abstract knowledge? Four case studies are described that use
the metro map metaphor for presenting abstract,
interconnecting "trains of thought". These four case studies
include using a metro map to summarise the ideas in a
complex thesis, using a metro map to communicate a business
plan, using a metro map as navigation aid for web pages and
using a metro map to assist university students understand a
course structure. This paper discusses the aspects of these
abstract metro maps from an information visualisation
perspective. Experiences learned from the case studies are
used to introduce some issues and guidelines for using this
metaphor to help people find their way through more abstract
data.

1. Introduction
The network map of the London Underground is often
put forward as a good example of information visualisation
[1]. The current "look and feel" of the map developed over
many years from original work by Harry Beck in 1933 [2].
Now the familiar metaphor is used throughout the world to
represent metropolitan train networks [3].
This paper describes some preliminary work into
exploring the efficacy of the metro map metaphor for
applications of more abstract data. In particular we are
interesting in applying this metaphor to the task of:
"Navigating an unfamiliar information space that consists of
interconnecting tracks of thought".
Metaphors are an important tool in information displays
as they provide familiar cognitive models to help users to
browse unfamiliar information spaces [4]. In an exploration
mode the user may be seeking to build up a conceptual model
of a new information space. This is an iterative process of
interaction and exploration that allows the user to form a

mental model. Metaphors provide a useful starting point for
the formation of this mental model. It is presumed that good
metaphors give users a good mental model and so enable
good displays of abstract data.
But is the "metro map" a good metaphor. Tufte
complements the design as it "provides a coherent overview
of a complex system" [5] but also suggests that the map is so
attuned to representing its data that it does not provide a good
practical generic architecture for information design [5].
Certainly we must expect that the metro map metaphor is not
appropriate for all tasks and types of abstract data. The metro
map has also become an icon in modern culture and so there
is also the real danger that the metaphor can be used purely as
a marketing device. Hence too little thought may be given to
the type of information being displayed on the metro map and
the intended application.
The metro map metaphor has been previously
investigated for 'guided tours' of web pages [6]. In the
Webvise system users could navigate web pages via an
interactive metro map [6]. The map aimed to support novice
library users navigate through topics (stations) in a particular
subject area (coloured tracks). The researchers report that
users found the system very intuitive [7]. Users also found
the maps engaging and useful for maintaining context while
navigating the web sites (stations) [7]. Unfortunately, no
quantitative results on the efficacy of the system are reported.
One feature of the maps used in Webvise is that the
stations do not overlap and interconnect, except at least in a
trivial way at a central starting point. This highlights one area
where this display fails to utilise the full potential of the
metro map metaphor. That is, it does not try to reinforce
interconnections along the tracks or support the user in a task
that requires changing tracks.
The fundamental questions of when and how to use the
metro map metaphor have not been addressed by previous
work. Therefore the short term aim of this paper is to better
qualify what type of information is best displayed with the
metaphor and to understand the tasks that it best supports. To
do this a number of case studies are used to explore the
features of the metaphor. These case studies are designed for
the more specific goals of:
• Explaining the complex interconnection of ideas in a
doctoral dissertation (section 2).

•

Communicating the main items in a business plan
(section 3).
• Providing a navigation aid to web pages used for
orientating university students (section 4).
• Assisting potential students understand a tertiary
course structure (section 5).
In the following sections each of the case studies is
described in more detail. The discussion on each application
highlights different aspects of the metaphor and how these
aspects relate to understood principles of information
visualisation.

2. Case Study 1 - Thesis Map
Design Goal: Develop a diagram for explaining complex
interconnection of ideas in a PhD dissertation.
User: A first time reader of the thesis.
Users Task: To understand the major disciplines covered
in the thesis and how the contributions of the thesis are
derived from these disciplines.
Description: The thesis map (figure 1) shows ten
interconnecting tracks of thought. These include the six
fundamental areas on which the thesis [15] is based, the three
major contributions and track representing a validating case
study. The fundamental tracks include abstract data, data
mining, information display, human perception, virtual
environments and software engineering. The three major
contributions of the thesis, are the MS-Taxonomy, the MSGuidelines and the MS-Process. These three "tracks of
thought" are derived from the cross over of ideas covered by
the six fundamental areas. A final track is the case study used
to evaluate the contributions. The stations are sub-topic areas
within the main tracks. For example, the software
engineering track has stations called, abstraction,
architecture, taxonomy, iterative prototyping, design process
and quality principles.
The use of color codes in the tracks are based directly on
the colours used in the London Underground Map. Colour is
an excellent way to display nominal categories [8]. It has
been shown that in visual search and recognition tasks
colours add speed, accuracy and memorability to the task [9,
10, 11]. However, it is important that the different colours are
clearly perceived as different. This can be achieved using
either distinct lightness levels or changes of hue [12]. Both
focal and non-focal categories have been shown to be equally
effective [13, 14]. One final check is that too many large
areas of strong colour can be unpleasant to look at as the
"placing of light, bright colours mixed with white next to each
other produces unpleasant results" [8].
With this map there was no underlying spatial map to
guide layout. The tracks are laid out only to optimise the use
of space. The aim is to provide a precise overview that shows
as much detail as possible but fits on a single page. This is
described as providing both context and detail and is an
effective strategy used in other display systems [4].

One major restraint on how the space is used is the
common problem from cartography and that is how to ensure
adequate space for labelling the features (stations). Because
distance is not meaningful in the map there is some allowance
on where to place stations to assist with labelling problems.
However, topology relations are implied in the ordering of the
stations. For example tracks are shown to begin at a main
station. All subsequent stations have a linear ordering. For
example, on the MS-Process track, the stations appear in the
order of the process steps.
The data in the display consists of ten nominal categories
with sub-categories. Therefore the data is simply a two level
hierarchy. The top level forms the tracks and the second level
the stations. Interconnections can occur at any station and
some stations have close proximity relations that must be
maintained.
As with a typical metro map, a familiar technique is used
to simplify structure. Meandering curved tracks are avoided.
Tracks are made as linear as possible and laid out with a
preference for horizontal or vertical lines. Angled lines are
used less frequently and kept at 45° where possible. One
aesthetic of metro tracks is the use of a tight curve where
tracks change direction. This tends to soften the look of many
sharp direction changes. While desirable this feature is not
included in this map due to limitations with the drawing
package.
Tracks can diverge, for example the human perception
track is shown splitting into the three sensory components
(vision, hearing, touch). Tracks can also loop. For example,
some steps of the MS-Process track are iterative and these
iterative steps are shown as a looping track. Features such as
diverging and looping tracks can also found in normal metro
maps. One unusual structure in this diagram is formed where
the three divergences of the information display track cross
over the three divergences of the human perception track. This
creates a 3x3 grid of crossovers that helps to illustrate the nine
main classes used in the MS-Taxonomy. One other unusual
aspect of the map is that tracks often run close to each other
for extended periods. For example the case study track closes
tracks the MS-Process track. Normally in a metro map these
tracks would converge to a single line, yet in the thesis map it
is desirable to maintain the separation and so parallel tracks
are used.
Feedback from users about the effectiveness of the map is
purely subjective at this stage. However users show obvious
signs of engagement with the diagram and have reported no
difficulty understanding how to interpret the map.

3. Case Study 2 - Business Plan Map
Design Goal: To communicate the main items in a
business plan.
User: The target user is a general reader of the plan who
is not familiar with the content.
Users Task: To understand the major items included in
the business plan.

Description: The business plan map is a multiple level
diagram. The business plan itself is from the Faculty of
Science and Agriculture at Charles Sturt University in
Australia. At the top level the business plan is treated as a
single track with four main stations (figure 5). These stations
correspond to the four major initiatives of the plan, that is,
education, research, resources and regional engagement.
From each main station run single or multiple tracks that
represent the sub topics of each part of the plan. At the next
level the actual business plan items for each sub-area are
shown (figure 2).

Figure 5 Top Level Business Plan Map
One interesting feature of the business plan map is that
variations of hue have been used to emphasis groups of tracks.
For example the tracks under "resources" are various shades of
blue.
At the lowest level the stations are items that have quite a
lot of associated text. This makes laying out the labels
problematical but this could be simply solved by giving the
items appropriate labels and using some form of interaction to
display the full text.
There is little doubt that the power of the metro map
metaphor has not been utilised. For example, no
interconnecting stations are shown. Having discussed the plan
with management however, it is apparent that a number of
items are connected. These were not highlighted in the
original plan to avoid complexity. It is intended in the next
iteration to highlight these overlaps by using interconnecting
stations. In the current configuration, the content could be
equally well displayed using any hierarchical display method
such as a tree graph or a simple table.
While it is easy to dismiss the display as a trivial
marketing trick, some aspects that should not be overlooked
are the engagement factor and also the advantages of using a
spatial layout to enhance memory [16]. Certainly recall is a
desirable feature of business plans and it may be that
communication of such plans is often handicapped by lack of
interest of staff at some levels. Hence it could be argued that

ensuring user engagement and improving their recall of
content may enhance communication.

4. Case Study 3 - Web Page Map
Design Goal: To provide a navigation aid for students
using a series of web pages.
User: The target users are first time students who may
wish to browse or locate relevant resources.
Users Task: To initially understand the overall content
and subsequently to locate specific resources.
Description: The web site map (figure 3) shows the six
main tracks of information available on a series of web pages
that are part of an orientation package. The package is called
'SITOR - School of Information Technology Orientation
Resources' and is designed to assist new students,
commencing course work at the Charles Sturt University's
Bathurst Campus. The six tracks correspond to the six main
sections of SITOR and include, welcome, meet-the-staff,
maps-resources, survival-fun, research-teaching and the metro
site-map itself. Stations on each track correspond to the main
headings of each section. SITOR is organised around a
traditional set of web pages and a traditional means of
navigation that uses hierarchical menus. A main menu is
always visible at the top of each web page. Users can directly
select a section to visit using this menu. Second level dropdown menus under each section title allow the user to select a
heading within a section. The web page metro map is provided
as an alternative way for students to view the content of
SITOR and also to navigate it. The map has hotspots, allowing
students to click on a station or track and visit that area.
While the general idea is very similar to the techniques
used in the Webvise system [6] one subtle difference is that
some tracks in SITOR overlap. For example, the meet-the-staff
track overlaps with the tracks for maps-resources and
research-teaching. These are logical connections as students
may wish to locate a staff member's office on the map or
alternatively look up some specific information about a staff
member's research interests or teaching approaches.
A problem detected in the design of this map is
scalability. For example, the meet-the-staff track has a separate
page for over 20 twenty staff members yet these stations are
not shown on that track. This was a conscious decision and
was made in an effort to reduce the overall complexity. This
the first time SITOR has been produced so it is difficult to
make comments on usability.

5. Case Study 4 - Course Map
Design Goal: To assist potential students understand a
tertiary course structure.
User: A potential or existing student.
Users Task: To understand the subjects a student must
complete to be awarded a tertiary degree.
Description: The course map (figure 4) shows the four
main tracks that make up the Bachelor of Information

Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV’04)
1093-9547/04 $ 20.00 IEEE

Technology (Games) at Charles Sturt University in
Australia. The stations on these tracks represent individual
subjects and are labelled with both subject codes and names.
The main tracks are core-subjects, industry-subjects,
elective-subjects and specialised-games-subjects. Students
must visit all appropriate stations as specified in the
requirements for the course. For example, all core-subject
(green) stations must be visited as must all industry-subject
stations (orange). Students must also complete eight
specialised-games-subjects and three elective-subjects.
Once again there are no overlapping stations on the
map so the full power of the metaphor is not used. However,
a number of different courses are offered through the faculty
and there is the intention of eventually showing multiple
courses on the one map. In this case a number of overlaps
can be expected as a single subject (station) is a common
requirement for different courses.
One new feature of this map is the use of a background
"river" to provide an additional layer of information.
"Layering" is a useful technique described by Tufte [8]. In
this case all second level subjects can be identified as they
lie on the river. First level subjects are above the river and
all third level subjects are below it.
Although a textual description of course requirements is
readily available, some students find these difficult to
interpret. The course map has proved engaging for students
and some at students at least seem to prefer the spatial
layout. However work is still at a preliminary stage and the
future plan is to provide more levels on interactivity so that
students can nominate desired stations and so produce a
more personalised map through the course. This is more like
a generic trip planner than a purely static map. Some issues
yet to be addressed are how to best represent pre-requisites,
co-requisites and timetabling. For example, some subjects
are only offered in first or second semester.

6. Conclusion
Although work is preliminary and no formal evaluation
of usability has been completed, results to date confirm that
diverse users find the metro map intuitive and engaging for
navigating abstract data. It is also a useful way to provide
content and detail. The intuition is that one particular
advantage of the metro map metaphor is in situations where
users must navigate an information space for the first time
or at least in an infrequent or spasmodic way. More rigorous
usability tests are planned in the future.
The abstract data structure in all four cases can be
described more generically as a hierarchical graph with
interconnecting nodes where the tracks are the edges in the
graph and the stations are nodes. Graph drawing is an
emerging field of study and is fundamental to the field of
information visualisation [17]. One problem typically
reported in laying out networks is the problem of crossing
edges [17]. With the metro map this problem is alleviated by
the thickness of the tracks (edges). Indeed a number of

gestalt principles [18] such as familiarity (colour of tracks)
and continuation (linearity of tracks) help to ensure that the
user does not confuse the direction of tracks at crossovers.
Although algorithms have been developed to create metro
layouts [19], much work still needs to be done in this area.
