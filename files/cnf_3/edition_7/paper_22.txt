Abstract
Citation analysis has been applied in various
contexts for different purposes such as impact factors
estimation, co-citation pattern analysis, community
partitioning, and knowledge visualization etc. We
employed graph theory and authoritative sources
identification techniques, augmented with visualization
tools to discover critical research focuses from the
citation graph. The citation graph was built from data
retrieved from the CiteSeer database via a querying
robot. Two experiments were carried out to identify
important research focuses from the citation graph with
promising results. Established research focuses as well
as new research focuses were successfully identified by
the method we proposed and tried. Researchers new to a
field may use this method to locate important literature
in various fields, which in turn will facilitate their
learning and studying.
Keywords--- citation analysis, graph theory,
authorities, hubs, research focuses, visualization.

1. Introduction
Citation analysis is a tool that may be used to
discover latent information from voluminous literatures.
It has been used to calculate the impact factors of
authors, articles and journals. It may also be used to
unveil a holistic view of the research domain.
Researchers new to a field may utilize citation analysis to
facilitate rapid comprehension of a research domain. The
enormous growths of knowledge and scholarly research
literatures have made tracking the latest developments in
science a complex task. It is more imperative to develop
methods and tools to cope with the explosive quantative
growth of existent research papers.
We proposed an approach to elicit the main
knowledge trunk from a citation graph. The knowledge
trunk is represented by a weak connected component of a
graph, and is used to facilitate the discovery of research
focuses of a designated knowledge domain. Papers with
a distinct focus are grouped into detached weak

connected components in the graph. The detached weak
connected components are visually legible, and are
considered to be distinct research focuses in the given
knowledge domain.

2. Related works
Yuan An et al. [1] presented a novel work on graph
analysis for citation network. They built a graph using a
robot to extract information from the Digital Library
Research Index [1]. The citation information extracted
by them was primarily focused on computer science
literatures. The extracted topics included Neural
Networks, Software Engineering and Automata. After
building a citation graph from the database, various
characteristics of the graph were calculated and
examined. They confirmed the power law for degree
distribution in all graphs that have been found in other
studies [1]. The fraction of papers with in-degree i is
proportional to i-r whereas r is 1.71. They also found that
portion of the out-degree distribution with outward
citation larger than 18 followed the power law with r
valued at 2.32. The consistent power law demonstrated
that the citation network presents itself as a self-asserting
phenomenon. Other graph measurements presented in
their papers include weakly and strongly connected
components. The citation graph consisted of a giant
weakly connected component which includes about 80%
to 90% of nodes and a few very small components. A
few tiny strongly connected components were also
derived from the citation graph.
Kleinberg [12] introduced the HITS algorithm used
to construct hubs and authorities in a hyperlinked
environment, like the Web or scientific literatures. WenJun Zhou et al. [23] explored the community partitioning
problem with the citation network. They described a
community as a set of concentric circles like onion ring
with a core set and affiliated objects. The core set
includes a few authorities. An authority usually is
recognized as an important and widely cited paper in a
specific scholarly domain. The affiliated objects are
connected to objects in the core set and are ranked
according to their importance. The authors considered

previous works, on the topic of community mining, such
as using authoritative resources finding and graph
structure partitioning methods, had shortcomings.
Objects in the communities are not ranked, no
overlapping object is allowed in the communities, and
there are no functions to measure the similarities among
objects. The authors therefore proposed a novel model to
remedy the deficiencies of these methods.
Perkowitz and Etzioni [15] developed conceptual
cluster mining of Web pages using a topology based
clustering method to analyze users’ navigation logs.
They claimed that the conceptual clusters built from
users’ navigation logs can be utilized to improve the
index page synthesis, and thereby facilitate effective
surfing on the Web. Sarukkai [18] suggested an approach
to do link prediction and path analysis on the Web using
Markov chains. He showed that the analysis and
modeling of Web links, and structures from users’
navigation logs, could be used to predict link sequences
facilitating navigation of the Web. Deshpande and
Karypis [10] used a selective Markov model to improve
the link prediction.
Chen and Paul [8] extended traditional co-citation
analysis by combining it with Pathfinder network scaling

grouping by evaluating the impact of a particular author

revealed several intellectual groups. Leading authors in
these groups can also be visually identified.

that they are similar phenomenon, and research findings
are found to be complementary. As shown in Figure 2,
the distribution of out-degree does not follow the power
law.

3. Measurements of the citation graph
A citation graph was built from the literatures
retrieved by querying the term “citation analysis” from
CiteSeer – the largest free on-line literature database
[17]. The graph includes 4401 document nodes and 9959
citation arcs. The in-degree and out-degree distributions
of the citation graph were calculated. We found that the
in-degree distribution follows the power law as shown in
pervious studies [5, 13, 14]. However, the out-degree
distribution doesn’t follow the power law as described in
the studies cited. We also examined the diameter and
weak connected components of the graph.

3.1. Degree distributions
It had been found in previous studies [5, 13, 14] that
the in-degree and out-degree distribution of Web graphs
complied to the power law with the identical exponent
2.1 for in-degree distribution and 2.71 for out-degree
distribution [5, 13]. An et al. [1] found in-degree
distribution in power law with exponent 1.71 in their
experiments; and out-degree is 2.32. The in-degree and
out-degree distributions of the citation graph we built are
shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The in-degree
distribution of our graph complies with the power law
with an exponent value of 2.3. The power law commonly
shared by both Web and scholarly literatures suggests

Figure 2 Out-degree distribution of nodes

3.2. Connected components
The connected components of a graph are among the
other revealing characteristics besides the degree
distribution. There are two kinds of connected
components – the weak connected components (WCC)
and the strong connected components (SCC). A WCC
exists in undirected graphs and is defined as a component
where there exists at least one path between any two
nodes. A SCC exits in a directed graph and is defined as
a component where every node is reachable from every
other node. A WCC or SCC could be thought of as a
community in which all nodes are related.
There are 6 WCCs found in the citation graph. The
biggest WCC includes 4386 nodes (articles) which is
99.66% of the complete graph. The citation graph here
has a dense structure such that almost all articles have a

direct or indirect relation to each other. The WCCs found
are given in Table 1. In contrast with the Web graph, the
SCCs are very rare in the scholarly citation graph due to
its chronological nature. Because papers may only refer
to literatures published earlier. Unlike the Web graph, it
is not possible for the published scholarly articles to
renew their references later. Yuan An et al. [1] found
some SCCs exist in the scholarly citation graph and
provide a rationale for this rare phenomenon. They found
that it happened due to several reasons such as the
publications were written by the same authors, or the
authors had been working closely together. We also
found four SCCs, which are all tiny but the biggest one
includes only seven nodes. Table 2 lists the SCCs
discovered in the citation graph.

3.3. Diameter and distribution of distances
The diameter of the citation graph is 10, which is
much smaller than has been found in previous work [1,
13]. This means our graph is denser than that of [1, 13].
The average distance between any nodes is 3.3. All
distances lower than 5 links account for 92.44% of the
distribution of distances, revealing a densely-structured
graph.

4. Identifying critical focuses via the citation
graph
As we have seen above, there are a lot of trivial
nodes existing in the citation graph that are cited either
one or zero times. A method is devised to prune out the
trivial nodes and retaining the important nodes. The

remaining nodes after the pruning are considered to be
constituents of the main trunk of a knowledge domain.

4.1. The scheme
The pruning method we developed consists of two
steps. One threshold value is employed in each step
respectively. The first step filters out all the nodes with
the in-degree value less than the first threshold value.
The purpose of the first step is to build the highly cited
initial core set of nodes. The second step checks the indegree value of the nodes of those papers that are citing
or cited by the papers in the initial core set. Those papers
with an in-degree value higher than the second threshold
will be added to the initial core set. The procedure
terminates when all the nodes in the core set are
processed and no new nodes can be added to the core set.
When there are one to several weak connected
components, each of these represents a focus in the
research domain. The complete algorithm is listed as
below:
1. Build the complete citation graph.
2. Select the first and second threshold values t1
and t2.
3. Keep nodes with in-degree value higher than t1
as the initial core set S.
4. For each unique s in S
o Find inbound (cited by) and outbound
(citing) papers I and O
o ∀ i in I, if inbound i > t2 and i not in S,
add i to S
o ∀ o in O, if inbound o > t2 and o not in
S, add o to S
5. ∀ s, t in S, t≠s, an edge is added if s is citing or
citied by t.
The threshold values are set as the function of the
power-law curve of the in-degree distribution as depicted
in Figure 1. The first threshold is set as the value x1
where the cumulative probability distribution function of
the power-law curve P(x1) = 0.25%. The second
threshold is set as x2 where P(x2) = 1%.

4.2. Experiments
Applying the scheme discussed above, the
thresholds x1 and x2 were set at 50 and 25 respectively.
Figure 3 depicts the graph with 50/25 threshold values.
The graph in Figure 3 contains only one weak
component with 19 papers in it. The result highlights that
these 19 papers are related to each other one way or
another because at least one path exists among them.
These 19 papers may be considered as the core
knowledge trunk extracted from the citation graph. A
researcher who is interested in exploring this particular
knowledge domain may be better prepared by studying
all the papers contained in the core knowledge trunk.
With the knowledge trunk in place, we tried to further
examine the property of authority and hub of these 19

papers by visualization of the roles and weights. The
nodes with yellow color represent authorities in Figure 4.
The red-colored nodes stand for hubs. Green represents
nodes that have a dual role as the authority and hub. The
size of nodes in Figure 4 signifies the relative importance
as an authoritative node.

The authoritative nodes identified in Figure 4 were
further analyzed for identifying the dominating research
focuses in this consolidated citation graph. The papers
[2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 16, 22] are the seven most authoritative
papers identified in the graph. We further examined the
keywords shared by these seven critical papers to have a
better overview of the important research focuses
represented by these papers. The research focuses are
summarized in Table 3. The content of these papers
were examined and are summarized below. Chakrabarti
et al. [6] developed a system for automatically compiling
a list of authoritative Web resources on any topic; Brin
and Page [4] offered Google as an application designed
to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce
better search results than existing systems; Pirolli et al.
[16] tried to improve the approach of abstracting the
Web; Bharat and Henzinger [2] combined content
analysis with traditional connectivity analysis to improve
topic searching on the Web; Kleinberg [12] discussed a
technique for locating high-quality information related to
a broad search topic on the WWW by utilizing
authoritative sources of information. In all the five
papers noted above, we found common key words and
phrases such as “hypertext structure”, “topic distillation”,
“link analysis”, “World Wide Web”, and “information
retrieval” etc. Based on our analysis, the main research
focus in this field concerns the searching and information
distillation technique. We then identified the authors
whose names appeared multiple times. The authors
identified included Jon M. Kleinberg, David Gibson,
Soumen Chakrabarti, Sergey Brin, Lawrence Page, and
Prabhakar Raghavan. In addition to the main research
focus found so far, two other papers were recognized as
focusing on a dissimilar topic. The analysis on [11, 22]
reveals the topic they dealt with is the clustering of
documents on the Web.

The high thresholds we selected have helped us to
discover the most researched topics with a general query
term. However, new research focuses may be omitted by
this process due to infrequent citation that is generally
received by literatures published recently. We therefore
did another experiment with the much more lenient
threshold values of x1=7 and x2=4 to rebuild the
consolidated citation graph. Figure 5 depicts the graph
results from the smaller threshold values, which consists
of 333 papers. We made a visualized graph as we had
done earlier according to the weight of the authoritative
papers, as presented in Figure 6. We found three weak
components in Figure 5, which has a large component in
the center and two much smaller components in the
upper left corner. The research domains represented by
these two weak components may signify new research
focuses that are interesting, and may warrant further
exploration. The first smaller component with two green
nodes is a research focus that has two papers [8, 9],
which are number 107 and 108 in the graph, focused on
visualizing information in a knowledge domain. The
keywords of [9] include “information visualization”,
“information retrieval”, and “graphical user interface”
and “browsing”; the keywords of [8] are “computer
graphic visualization”, “knowledge visualization”,
“author co-citation patterns”, and “knowledge
landscape”. The result implies visualization is another
research focus in the area of citation analysis.
Researchers who are interested in this focus may gain a
useful overview by studying these two papers. The
second weak component from the graph represents two
papers [20, 21], which are number 225 and 226 in the
graph. The author of one of these papers is Barry
Wellman and the other paper was coauthored by himself
and Milena Gulia. The research focus represented by
these two papers is the correspondence between
computer and virtual communities with social
communities in reality. The new research focuses are
summarized in Table 4.
The network constructed in Figure 4 reveals the
relationships among highly cited papers. The co-citation
relationships among these highly cited papers are not
exposed by this figure. Pathfinder network [7, 8] is
depicted in Figure 7 to illustrate the co-citation
relationships among nodes in Figure 4. The number
labeled along the edges represents the frequency of co-

citation of the two nodes connected by that particular
edge. The size of a node is in proportion to the sum of
the co-citation frequencies with other nodes in the graph.
The two biggest nodes are node number 2 [4] and 7 [12].
The references [4] and [12] are also among the most cocited papers, and they may represent the concept symbols
[19] in the research area of “Hyperlinked Environment”.
We summarize the information in Figures 4 and 7 in
Table 5. The first column in the table is the node number
in the figures. The second column stands for the

hyperlink in CiteSeer. The third column stores the title of
the paper or the reference number if it is referred. The
fourth and fifth column stores the authoritative rank of
nodes in Figure 4 and 7 respectively. As we can see
from Table 6, the most authoritative paper in Figure 4 is
[6]. However, [6] is not the most cited or co-cited paper
in Figure 7. The Pathfinder network and the knowledge
trunk proposed by us reveal different information that
may be applied for different purpose, or they may
provide complementary information.

Conclusions
The approach we propose has helped identify critical
research focuses in a knowledge domain. Consolidated
citation graph with varied granularities may be derived
by adjusting the threshold values in the pruning process.
Major research focuses as well as new focuses can be
visually or algorithmically discovered by identifying
weak connected components in the graph. A general
research or knowledge domain coded by a general term,
in our example – citation analysis, can be further
deciphered into distinct research focuses to facilitate
researchers to gain a helpful overview of the field. Key
papers of a research focus can be identified to help naïve
researchers gain insight into the most important
literatures in a given field. We envisioned the method
discussed in this paper as a guiding aid that helps
researchers direct their inquiring efforts and locate
pertinent key literatures.
