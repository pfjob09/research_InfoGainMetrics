apid advances in geographic information systems have created a potential for dynamic
geovisualisation (geovis) to be integrated with exploratory information visualisation
(infovis). The fast growing quantity of statistical data accessible over the Internet creates
potential for such integrated tools to be used in a wide range of application domains. The
analysts search for relationships, patterns and trends to gain understanding and knowledge of the
data without having any prior assumptions or theories. While researchers have made substantial
advances in infovis and geovis over the past decade, many challenges remain. As statistics data
sets become increasingly large and complex, the users require more effective multi-dimensional
visualisation tools and faster interactive performance. This challenge demands improved
fundamental methods for data model and visual exploration analysis. The potential to apply
integrated infovis and geovis tools for analysing multivariate statistics data over time represents
another interesting research challenge. The Web is today’s prominent medium to disseminate
geospatial data and maps, but most Web-enabled integrated infovis and geovis applications
provide limited interactive performance and are not suitable for collaboration. This presentation
will make an attempt to summarize research advances and remaining challenges through realtime demonstrations.
