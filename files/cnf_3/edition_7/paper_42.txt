Abstract
The paper presents an implementation of a user
interface for the Capture and Refinement of CFD Data
for Building Energy Analysis (CaRCA) that allows
interaction with building data in a context and
language familiar to the CFD engineer. This is made
possible by the use of an International Standards
Organisation - Standard for the Exchange of Product
Model data (ISO-STEP) compliant building product
model (BPM). The BPM used is the International
Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) developed Industry
Foundation Classes (IFC) schema. This allows early
introduction of the CFD engineer to the building
lifecycle and a method for recorded validation of CFD
predictions.
Keywords: CFD, Building Product Models, IFC.

Introduction

The EU has proposed new legislation [1] with
regard to benchmarking of buildings both in terms of
energy usage and associated CO2 emissions. This
places demands on building owners to identify and
quantify the energy usage of their properties against
benchmarks set by government energy/environmental
agencies throughout the building life cycle (design,
construction and operation). This will place the onus
onto the building designers to document and label:
• The potential (design) and actual (operation)
energy consumption of buildings
• The comfort levels of the design and
operational environments.
The University College Cork is in the process of
designing and building an Environmental Research
Institute (ERI) [2]. This project will be an Eco-friendly
“green building” utilising the current-best-available
design features, specifications, fittings/materials,
construction schemes and monitoring and control
systems that conform to the principles of sustainable
development and minimisation of environment impact.

amt6dbi@amsta.leeds.ac.uk

In essence, the building will be equipped with
environmental sensors providing a real-time data
stream of lighting, heating, energy consumption and
external environmental and climatic changes. The ERI
building will thus serve as an interactive
demonstration, teaching and research facility for the
design of “green buildings”. This research group
(IRUSE) will develop a Building Product Model
(BPM) which will be a living integrated computer
model of the building [3] which will include design
tools and data acquisition facilities that address
information gathering, monitoring and control features
for the entire ERI-Ecosite complex [4]. Sophisticated
energy modelling and simulation tools are available at
the design stage of buildings to predict energy usage
and comfort levels [5]. Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) is the most advanced of these tools. The results
of the CFD analysis can be used to determine an
optimal building design solution. However, the
complexity and depth of knowledge required to use
these tools has restricted their use to experts within
large and well-resourced building architectural and
engineering consultancies. Another inhibiting factor is
the lack of interoperability between the IT tools that
are used to develop such models. For example,
computer aided design tools, e.g. ArchiCAD [6] and
AutoCAD [7] are used to develop the geometric and
material representation of the building. CFD (e.g.
ICEM [8], CFX [9] and Fluent [10]) uses this
representation to develop a computational model so
that the analysis of the energy performance of the
building can be assessed. Therefore an interface
between these applications is necessary.
This project addressed the following issues:
• Establishment of an IT framework that
facilitates the integration of these tools
through the use of the concept of a building
product model (BPM) using state-of-the art
database technology
• Development of a user interface for the
Capture and Refinement of CFD Data for

Building Energy Analysis (CaRCA) that
allows interaction with the building in a
context and language familiar the CFD
engineer.
The accuracy provided by CFD solutions is
necessary to provide sustainable solutions that ensure
the required energy savings. CFD is a labour intensive
process, especially in the areas of mesh generation and
visualisation. This structure will reduce the set-up time
for the CFD engineer. The project will combine the
advantages of CFD and Building Product Modelling
[5] into an application, which will enable the efficient
use of computational models by civil and building
engineers. This will make green design an attractive
and feasible option for both designer and client.

1.1 Energy
Since 1990, an increasing strain has been placed
on land resources in Ireland. This is a result of
increased demands for housing, commercial properties
and the development of a transport infrastructure.
These changes are related to high economic growth
and changing demographic and social patterns. Over
the period 1990-2000, the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) has increased by 102% and the energy
consumption by 48% [11].

Total Final Energy Consumption (TFC) [13]. This
translates to 18.2 Mt of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, which is 24.8% of Ireland's GHG emissions.
Information from Sustainable Energy Ireland suggests
that the percent of energy used for building space
heating (BSH) is 57% for residential and 52% for
commercial and services [11]. Based on these values,
an estimate of the total BSH is 21.1% of TFC, which
generates approximately 10Mt GHG emissions.
Therefore BSH contributes 13.7% to GHG emissions
[11]. Which is significant when compared to transports
18% share [13]. The National Climate Change
Strategy, in accordance with Ireland’s Kyoto Protocol
commitments, has targeted a 15.4Mt reduction in GHG
emissions by 2010. Of which buildings account for a
reduction of approximately 2.1Mt or 11% [14]. These
figures translate to an increasing pressure on building
designers to improve energy practice.
This makes the use of CFD, for internal airflow
analysis, an option for large residential and commercial
developments. These could be new or existing
developments. Where an increase in energy efficiency
would be accompanied by improvements in air quality
distribution. A 10-15% reduction in energy relating to
BSH is a realistic target. Ideally, a CFD certificate
(similar to the Danish system [15]) should be a
requirement for certain structures. Especially if one of
the following factors is high:
• Number of occupants
• Geometrical size
• Geometrical complexity
• Energy usage.
Changes are needed to streamline the CFD process
for use with building energy problems. This project
details a proposal for a structure for CFD use with a
Building Product Model.

1.2 Computational Fluid Dynamics

Figure 1 Building Lifecycle
Housing construction has increased steadily since
the mid-1990s to over 52,600 new housing
completions in 2001. Ireland has the highest house
building levels in Europe per unit of population. This
reflects the general trend towards smaller household
sizes and consequently an increased number of
households. In 2001 almost 65 per cent of households
contained three or fewer persons [12].
In 2001, the combined energy used for residential
and commercial sectors in Ireland was 38.2% of the

CFD is the application of numerical methods to
the solution of discrete models of the constitute
equations of fluid mechanics [16]. This tool can be
used in high-level design in the following areas:
• Energy Savings
• Pollutant Containment
• Temperature and Humidity
• External Wind Loading
• Internal Air Quality
• Smoke Control.
This analysis can provide results which in the past
were not possible. With the use of data visualisation
applications, results can be displayed in an easily
understood manner leading to more cost effective and
sustainable design solutions. Currently there are two

main computational analysis methods to improve
building energy efficiency, zonal networks [17] and
CFD. The former offers quick results for HVAC
designers. CFD is used in critical zones where more
detail is required. This application offers a higher level
of information relating to the dynamics of the airflow
within a building at the cost of a higher computational
time. CFD and zonal networks are complementary
methods of analysis and can be used in tandem, as
shown by Bartak et al [18]. The Building Product
Models will provide a means of connecting CFD and
zonal networks as well as real data (Sensor and
Building Management Systems) [4]. Therefore energy
efficiency can be improved using the BPM and
CaRCA. This is achieved by the earlier involvement of
the CFD engineer, which is vital to the successful
design of a project [2] of this complexity [31]. Also, by
providing a framework for validation of CFD
predictions, see Figure 1.

Product modelling has two main purposes, one is
to collect all information about a product, and to make
it available to all project members involved in its
design and construction; the other purpose is to
facilitate computerised analysis by providing the data
in one consistent format to various analysis software.
In addition to these two purposes, product modelling
facilitates communicating data between different
systems. The latter, is achieved by establishing
standards for each expert area.
Examples of BPM’s are CIMsteel [19] and the
COMBINE project [20] and for a detailed review see
[21]. The IRUSE Project Layout is shown in Figure 2.
An example of a BPM schema is the Industry
Foundation Classes (IFC) [22] developed by the
International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) [23].
This research group’s BPM is based around the IFC
schema.

1.4 Industry Foundation Classes
1.3 Building Product Models
The Building Product Model is an object-oriented
representation of a building in terms of geometry,
materials, and internal and external environments.
Traditionally data is organised separately by each
individual involved in the project. The clear
disadvantages to this system are as follows:
• Duplication of data
• Data is difficult to archive when the project is
complete
• Updating data over the duration of the project.
The BPM overcomes these problems by using a central
store for all information relating to the project. This is
achieved by using software engineering methodologies
to maximise the strengths of the resulting application.
This results in a powerful tool, which becomes central
to every stage of an engineering project from the initial
design, detailed design, production and maintenance to
the completed project lifecycle.

In 1994 AutoDesk formed a group to discuss the
integrated application development for the AEC
industry. By 1997, the group developed into a nonprofit organisation called the IAI. The aim of the IAI is
to create a standardised object-orientated model for
AEC projects but the organisation does not develop
software applications. It provides a schema for the
design and implementation of applications. This
schema is the Industry Foundation Classes and is
available without charge from the IAI.

As the IFC structure is object-orientated,
IfcWindow is a subclass of the following classes:
• IfcBuildingElement
• IfcElement

Design

The software engineering and specification of
CaRCA [5] is based on the requirements of the Design
Process. A summary of each of the steps is given
below and a schematic is shown in Figure 4.
Step 1 - Conceptual Design: The design team lead
by the Architect with team members from each design
domain (Structural Engineering, Building Services,
Quantity Surveying, etc.) creates an outline of the
building project based on discussion with the client.
Step 2 - Building Product Model Population: An
architectural drawing is created in object CAD [6,7] by
the design team after the conceptual design is
complete. The CAD package generates a STEPComplaint IFC file. This is used to populate the BPM.
The BPM resides in an STEP Express Complaint
object-oriented database [25]. Design members can

access, add or modify data depending on the level of
the user rights.
Step 3 – Retrieval of Data for CFD Analysis: The
building services engineer contacts the CFD engineer.
The CFD engineer uses CaRCA to connect the BPM.
This can be done over the Internet or on a local
network depending on the location of the BPM.
CaRCA receives all necessary data for a CFD analysis.
This would include all geometrical information,
building function, personnel loading and nodal network
results [26]. All this information is organised and
visualised for ease of use for the CFD engineer.
Step 4 - Refinement of Data for CFD Analysis:
CaRCA allows the engineer to select and refine data
before using the CFD analysis software. This is an
advantage over a direct CAD import because there is
no “CAD cleanup”. The CFD engineer selects the
zone, or collections of zones, for analysis and sets the
mesh density parameters. CaRCA creates the necessary
files depending on the mesh generator being used.
Step 5 - Mesh Generation and CFD Analysis:
The files are exported to the mesh generator with full
geometry and mesh sizing data. The CFD engineer can
then generate the mesh or can make further alterations.
The CFD solver is used to complete the analysis.
Step 6 - Results: When the analysis is complete,
the results and conclusions are placed in the BPM
using a STEP CFD Entity. The design team discuss the
results and recommend further investigation (repeat

Step 4 & 5) or make design changes to the project
based on the CFD results.
Step 7 - Validation: When the construction stage
of the project is complete, the Building Management
System (BMS) is installed and the building is
occupied. The CFD Engineer recommends sensor data
point locations. CaRCA assesses the BPM at intervals
of 3-6 months depending on building use. Data from

the BMS that includes real sensor data is retrieved [4].
This is compared to the CFD design results, which are
stored in the BPM. Based on this comparison, further
refinement can be achieved. This is a vital stage for the
development of CFD for use in the Building Industry
as it provides constant validation of the CFD
predictions.

Implementation

The application is built using Java 1.4 [27], EDM
Object Database [25] and VTK (Visual toolkit) [28].
The Java graphical user interface structure is shown in
Figure 5. This consists of four main parts: The
Function Buttons, the Data Tree, the Visualisation
Window and the Object Detail Table. CaRCA accesses
the database using an EDM binding. This binding
automatically searches the IFC structured database and
retrieves data relating to buildings, levels of buildings,

zones of levels and surfaces of zones. Additional
information in relation to zonal networks is extracted.
A data tree which is based on the project structure
and data is generated on the left hand side of CaRCA,
see Figure 5. Additional data relating to the selected
object is displayed in a table at the base of CaRCA.
This enables easy access to each object. This is a
crucial function, as the total data needs to be tailored or
modified to suit the needs of the CFD/energy engineer.
Levels, zones or individual surfaces can be selected or
deselected as required for the “analysis job”. When a
symmetrical domain is required a function for dividing
the zones can be used.

The data is visualised using VTK. The surfaces are
transferred to their 3D position using matrix
transformation and the relative location and direction
data from the BPM. When the modification process is
complete the mesh parameters are selected by pressing
the Mesh Parameters button. The user can choose a
fine, a medium or a course tetrahedral mesh density
depending on the type of analysis. Regions of interest
can be identified for denser local meshing. CaRCA
carries out this process automatically, or in special
cases the user can set it manually. Adding prism
sections at the surface of a tetrahedral mesh can
improve convergence [29]. The parameters for layers
of surface prisms can also be set automatically or
manually.
The ICEM file generator export button is pressed.
The mesh file generator works by retrieving data from
the Delaunay function within VTK. VTK creates a
Delaunay mesh for each surface and returns the
triangulation data that is used to generate the mesh file.
This creates a geometry file (tin format) and prism
parameters file (prism_params format) [8].
These are exported to ICEM where the meshing of
the job is completed. ICEM was chosen because it is
the leading commercial package for CFD mesh
generation. The resulting ICEM file can be exported to
all major CFD solvers.
The analysis is completed using the solver, e.g.
CFX or Fluent. Visualisation of the results is carried
out in a similar way. This stage will also allow uses to
access the BPM for real data, i.e. sensor data, [4]. This
will enable comparison of real and predictive data.
When the process is finished, the following
information relating to the CFD analysis is placed in
the BPM using a STEP CFD Entity:
• Location of the CFD results files
• Engineers involved in the analysis
• List of the zones analysed and the purpose of
each analysis
• Set of graphs and figures
• Recommended positions of sensor data points
• Conclusions and recommendation.
A future CFD entity needs be added to the IFC
Schema to make the results reporting easier. For this
project a CFD entity was added to the IFC Schema. For
illustration purposes a simplified computational
product model (CPM) schema is shown in Figures 6-7.
The CPM contains objects for site, building, level,
zone, door, etc. It is similar in structure to IFC but it
only includes entity relevant to the CFD domain
expert. This shows how a CFD entity would complete
the task of the computational analysis for buildings.

Test Case

The test case was chosen to show the advantages
of the CaRCA application and also the limitations of
the current version. These limitations will be addressed
in the next stage of the project. The test case is an
operating theatre and this will demonstrate the use of
CFD analysis with an IFC structured BPM.

global tetra setting and 0.14 m for the wall, floor,
ceiling, and door surface families. The outlet was set to
0.04 m. The prism parameters were set to 3 layers with
no initial height. The ICEM export button was pressed
and the tin format and prism_params files were
generated. These files were opened in ICEM. The
internal panels of the main laminar air inlet, the
furniture and the personal were added.

Figure 8 Completed Mesh
The geometry was drafted in object CAD as it
would be done by the Design team. This was saved as
an IFC STEP P21 file [24] and was used to populate
the BPM. The CFD engineer would be contacted and
asked to examine the project. CaRCA would be
connected to the BPM over a local network and
automatically retrieved all the data relevant to the
analysis. The CFD engineer would identify the
operating theatre for optimisation.

Figure 10 Data Point Locations
In the next version of CaRCA, these will be
created automatically from the BPM. The meshing was
completed with ICEM, see Figure 8. The analysis was
completed using CFX, see Figure 9. The boundary
conditions for the inlet and outlet and the turbulence
model and other setting were decided using the
expertise of the CFD engineer. This recognizes that the
knowledge of the CFD domain expert is irreplaceable
[31]. After the analysis, the CFD engineer selected 48
data points that will need to be checked when the
construction and commissioning stages are complete,
see Figure 10.

The operating theatre was selected in CaRCA and
the symmetry function used to divide the operating
theatre as the zone and the airflow is symmetrical. The

points and the results. A section of this data has been
used to populate the CFD Entity of the CPM, see

Future Developments and Conclusions

Future developments of CaRCA include the use of a
HVAC and CFD libraries. These libraries would
contain commonly used objects, which could be easily
accessed and transferred to the work area. The
information would be constructed from existing
databases. Addition data, such as the boundary
conditions for airflow devices will also be retracted
from the BPM, an export facility to CGNS [30] will be
investigated and the link between the zonal network
and CFD will be further developed from a result
transfer connection to an analysis coupling connection
as discussed by Bartak et al [18]. The next version of
CaRCA will include data for the boundary conditions
relating to each zone for the following:
• Inlet and outlet airflow data
• Heating and cooling devices
• Furniture and equipment
• Personnel loading.
A computer based tutorial will be set-up and used
to introduce the concepts of BPM and CFD to
undergraduates students. This will provide a supply of
competent engineers to use this technology. The use of
CaRCA with Internet computational solvers in the
future will be investigated. These severs would reduce
the overheads required for medium sized consultants to
carry out computational analysis.
Table 1 summarises the process for the CFD
domain expert. It also highlights the two different types
of steps involved; data centred and task centred.

Table 1: Summary of the Process Steps
Data centred tasks relate to steps which do not
require the knowledge of the CFD engineer and task
centred require the CFD engineer’s knowledge and
experience. CaRCA and the BPM reduce the effort
required to carry out the data centred steps though
automation and the use of standard models. With the
implemented of CaRCA, the following aims are be
achieved:
• Reduction of the effort required for a CFD
engineer in the data centred steps

•

An efficient means of introducing a CFD
engineer earlier into the design process
• Structured control of all data relating to CFD
analysis relating to AEC projects.
There is also a link to energy analysis data relating
to the project by other energy experts. This puts a
powerful tool in the hands of the building designer,
which can dynamically apply sustainable engineering
principles.
