reenwich, the location of the IV 05 Conference, is the heart of time measurement. Clocks
and watches visualise time in form of a continuous, regular and linear process. This is the
basis for the planification of common activities in human society worldwide. For the last three
hundred years this visualisation has been an important basis of success and the symbol of the
belief that human beings can manage, forecast and planify almost all important situations in life.
But more and more we have to deal today with highly complex chaotic and non-linear processes.
Actions often have global dimensions and a multitude of impacts and effects on various levels
(even beyond cultures, continents and generations). Most of current processes can not be planned
or managed by linear or sequential structures any more. Traditional management as well as tools
and methods which are based on clock work principles and on linear mechanisms of cause and
effect often turn out to be ineffective. This leads to new challenges and the need for new
behaviours and new ways of acting.
In the field of visualisation a kind of change of paradigm is resulting from this evolution.
Working with sequences of separate images, graphics or audiovisual representations is not
sufficient any more in business processes, in development and change. Seen from the perspective
of the Dialogarchitect® Process Visualisation (ProVis) today has to work with visual overviews
creating complex networks of knowledge, facilitating and linking actions visibly connected and
situated in a transparent multilevel flow of time.
After the live demonstration of the visualisation of a chaotic process the talk will show some
ProVis project examples dealing with key challenges such as:

Intercultural Dialogue and Common Identity Building
Design of New Business Processes and Sustainable Communication
Improvement of Organizations and Living Mergers
Involvement in Client Relationship and Service Behaviour
Development of Settings and Environments
Virtual Community Building and Sustainable Remote Collaboration
Corporate Responsibility and Global Partnership

Facing these challenges ProVis can play a relevant role for “Designing the Future”. It has the
potential to simulate future realities and non-linear processes and to facilitate an open real-time
dialogue and an effective collaboration process between different stakeholders involving all
people concerned in a participation process beyond the borders of different cultures and different
interests.
