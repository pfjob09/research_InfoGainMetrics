Abstract

J using ”edge contraction and edge expansion techniques” which are quite complicated. The algorithm
given in [1] is not rely on the edge labelling but only
using a depth-ﬁrst search together with a simple proof
of Thomassen’s characterization.
There are other works around of orthogonal graph
drawings. Here in the graph drawing each edge of
the graph is polygonal chain consisting of horizontal and vertical segments; for example area-e!cient
orthogonal drawing of Papakostas and Tollis [8] in
which they gave algorithms for graphs with maximum vertex degree four with area at most (roughly)
0=76q2 by using at most 2q + 2 bends where each
edge in such a drawing has at most two bends. For
two-connected planar graphs can be embedded in an
q × q grid with 2q + 4 bends [9],[10]. Kant has shown
that if the graph is triconnected of maximum degree four, then it can be embedded into q × q grid
with at most 3 bends per edge [11]. Even and Granot has given an algorithm orthogonal drawing of
4-connected graph with at most 3 bends per edge
[12]. Schäter has given algorithm for the orthogonal
drawing of 4-connected graphs without considering
planarity by using at most two bends per edge [15].
Lower bound 2q  2 was given for the number of the
bends when the graph is biconnected planar graph
[14]. Complexity of embedding of 3-planar graphs
was given in [13]. Leighton [16] and Valiant [17] took
the problem from the point of area optimization.
In this paper we have given an alternative approach
to the rectangular drawing of the plane graphs of type
I, i.e.,J( 3) (Section 2). That is planar graph with
all vertex degrees three except exactly four vertices
are of degree two. Our method is based on the rectangular drawing of any spanning tree of the given

We have given necessary and su!cient conditions
which is an extention of Thomassen’s characterization of the rectangular drawing of plane graphs with
maximum vertex degree four. A drawing algorithm is
also proposed.

Introduction

Recently Rahman, Nakano and Nishizeki [1] have
given an e!cient grid drawing algorithm for plane
graphs with lower bounds Z +K ? q@2 and Z ×K 
q2 @16, where q is the number of the vertices in J
and Z and K are respectively the width and the
height of the rectangular grid. The input of their algorithm is a graph J with all vertex degrees three
except four vertices of degree two on the rectangular outercycle. Historically, Ungar was the ﬁrst to
consider rectangular drawing of plane graphs and he
showed that every plane, cubic, cyclically 4-edge connected graph has a rectangular representation [18].
C. Thomassen generalized this result and give a necessary and su!cient condition for a plane graph to
have a rectangular drawing [2] which his proof would
not lead to an e!cient graph drawing algorithm i.e.,
at least R(q3 ) time needed. After [2] necessary and
su!cient condition for the existence of a ”rectangular dual” of a plane graph along with a several algorithms have been given for the rectangular drawing of
the dual graph of a given plane graph, see for example K. Kozminski and E. Kinnen [3], J. Bhasker and
S. Sahni [4], X. He [5],[6] and G. Kant and X. He [7].
These algorithms are based on the edge-labelling of

plane graph. We have given also necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the rectangular drawing of the
plane graphs of type II, i.e., J( 4) that is plane
graphs with maximum vertex degree four and with
exactly four vertices of degree two which was listed
as an open problem in [1]. Section 4 outlines the
rectangular drawing algorithm which is based on the
rectangular drawing of an spanning tree and the four
regions deﬁned by the four degree two vertices of the
plane graph.

Rectangular Drawing of a
Plane Graph J( 3)

Figure 1:

Let J = (Y> H) be a 2-connected graph with vertex
set Y and edge set H. A graph is planar if it can
be embedded in the plane so that no two edges cross
each others. A plane graph is a planar graph with
a ﬁxed embedding. A plane graph divides the plane
into connected regions called faces and the contour
of a face as a clockwise formed by the edges on the
boundary of the face. The contour of the outerface
is denoted by Fr . The plane graph J denoted by
J( 3)> is called of type I if there exists exactly four
vertices with degree two on Fr and all other vertices
are of degree three. Since all degree two vertices are
assumed to be on the Fr they divide it into four paths
SQ > SH > SV > SZ , where the subscripts denote the respectively North, East, South and West paths and
thus ﬁxing the embedding of Fr as a rectangle. Similarly the plane graph J denoted by J( 4) if there
exists exactly four vertices with degree two on Fr and
all other vertex degrees are either 3 or 4. In Fig. 1
we have illustrated the plane graph which violates the
condition on the location of the degree two vertices.
Let us denote the four degree two vertices of J by
Q Z (upper-left corner of the grid), Q H (upper-right
corner of the grid), VZ (lower-left corner of the grid)
and VZ (lower-right corner of the grid). The identiﬁcation of these vertices will be in clockwise direction.
Let Wv denote any spanning tree of J( 3) and consider the paths s(l> m) 5 Wv between the vertices l and
m in Wv > where l> m 5 {Q Z> Q H> VZ> VH}= Clearly the
paths s(l> m) induces a sub-tree Wv>s of Wv . In general,

the sub-tree Wv>s divides the plane at most into four
regions Uz > Uh > Uv > and Uq as shown in Fig. 2= For
example the plane is divided respectively into one
(excluding the outer-region), two, three and four regions if exactly the lengths of any three, two, one and
none of s(l> m) paths are two. Note that the length of
all paths s(l> m) cannot be two at the same time since
this implies a cycle in Wv>j .

w.l.o.g. the edge ({> |) connecting the disjoint paths
s(Q Z> Q H) and s(VZ> VH) in Wv>s . Since Wv>s is
connected and there is exactly a single path between
any pair of end-vertices QZ> Q H> VZ and VH the
lemma follows.
In Fig. 2 we illustrate general structure of the subtree Wv>s of Wv that contains all of the degree two
vertices of J( 3).

Recall from [1],[2] that a Fr -component is either a
N2 whose vertices (but not edges) are in Fr or consists of a connected component of J  Y (Fr ) together with edges from that component to Fr and
their ends. A bad component is the Fr -component
which has a cycle with less than four legs or has
a critical cycle attached to the path SQ > SH > SV or
SZ except the outer cycle Fr or has a cycle F with
qff (F) = 0 attached to path (also corner of the drawing) S = SQ +SH > SH +SV > SV +SZ or SZ +SQ , except the outer cycle Fr . Where S{ > { 5 {Q> V> Z> H}
are the paths on Fr connecting appropriate degree
two vertices of J e.g., for SQ the path on Fr > with the
end-vertices being QZ and Q H etc.. and qff (F) (respectively qf (F)) is the number of counterclockwise
(resp. clockwise) legs of F for S and lastly a cycle
F is called a critical if either F is a counterclockwise
cycle and qf (F)  1 or F is a counterclockwise cycle
and qff (F)  1=
With the above deﬁnitions, the following lemmas
and theorem were given in [1] for a graph to have a
rectangular drawing , which is actually equivalent to
Thomassen’s characterization [2].

Lemma 4 ( [1] ) J( 3) has no rectangular drawing if J( 3) has a cycle F with qff (F) = 0 attached
to path S = SQ +SH > SH +SV > SV +SZ > or SZ +SQ ,
except the outer cycle Fr =
Theorem 5 ( [1]) Let J be a plane graph such that
all vertices have degree 3 except for the four corner
vertices of degrees 2 dividing the outer cycle Fr into
four paths SQ > SH > SV and SZ . Then J has an rectangular drawing if and only if J( 3) has no bad
components.
The su!ciency part of the above theorem is quite
lengthy and relies on partitioning paths, pairs etc. A
natural additional necessary condition to the above
theorem for the grid drawing of a plane graph J( 4)
is that any degree four vertex should not be on the
contour (or outer cycle Fr ) of the outer face. In Fig.
3 we have shown a plane graph J( 4) satisfying this
condition which has no grid drawing.
Lemma 6 J( 4) has no rectangular drawing if the
Fr -component has a cycle with less than or equal four
legs such that at least two of vertices of the end of the
legs in J  Y (Fr ) are of degree four.

Lemma 2 ( [1] ) J( 3) has no rectangular drawing if the Fr -component has a cycle with less than Proof.

The rectangular drawing algorithm

In this section we give an rectangular drawing algorithm for the plane graphs J( 3) and J( 4). The
algorithm is consisted of the following basic steps:
Algorithm A. Grid Drawing of the Plane Graphs
J( 3) and J( 4).

STEP 1. Input : Plane graph J. Output : Any
spanning tree Wv .
In this step we delete one by one the edges of J to
destroy the cycles of J= The deleted edges are called
the chords of the spanning tree Wv and denoted by
the sets Fl > l 5 {q> z> v> h}, where the index l denotes
that the chords contained in the regions i.e, north,
west, south and east. That is, in general we can write
F = Fq ^ Fz ^ Fv ^ Fh and if the region Ul is not
empty then it must have at least one chord. Since Wv

Step 2a.
Let Wv >s  Wv where Wv>s is obtained from Wv by taking union of the paths
XQ = {(x1 > xn )} and XV = {(xn2 > xn1 )}
are horizontal segments.
S (Q Z> Q H)> S (Q Z> VH)> S (QZ> VZ )> S (VZ> VH)
Since the number of edges in the path in Wv . Since there is single path between any two
s = {y1 > y2 > ===> yn1 } is just one edge more than the vertices of a tree, the sub-tree obtained by the union
edges in XZ exactly one of the cycle of length four of the four paths can easily be drawn (see Fig. 5(b)

Deﬁnition 7 Let F be any cycle of J( 4) with n
vertices x1 > x2 > ===> xn =
Let (y1 > x1 )> (y2 > x2 )> ===> (yn > xn ) 5 H(J( 4)) (legs of
F) . If there is a path S = {y1> y2 > ===> yn1 } of length
(n2) in J( 4) then we call the subgraph induced by
the vertex set {y1 > y2 > ===> yn } ^ {x1 > x2 > ===> xm } a webtrap subgraph of J( 4) (see Fig. 4).

region Uq , the south of the path S (VZ> VH) deﬁnes
the region Uv , the west of the path S (Q Z> VZ )

these drawings. We have not explicitly involved into
complexity of our algorithms but since the drawing algorithm is based on the rectangular drawing
of an arbitrary spanning tree of a given plane graph
it should be at least as e!cient as the one given in
[1]. A possible research in this direction is the following. Thomassen in [19] settling a conjecture of
G. Ringel [20] by proving that a plane, cubic graph
can be embedded in the plane such that each edge
is a straight line segment and each bounded face has
any prescribed area. Ringel’s conjecture was the special case of this problem in which all areas are the
same [20],[21]. Is the necessary condition given in
