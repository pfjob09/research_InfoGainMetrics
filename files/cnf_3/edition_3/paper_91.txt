this, we have collated examples of spatialization
paradigms to aide evaluation and comparison of past,
present and future result visualisation. Our approach
harmonises with the work of Morse et al [29] who also
take a reduced form approach for the evaluation and
comparison of multiple visualisation techniques.

Abstract
The rank-ordered list format is the prevailing result
presentation format of all the major Internet search
engine providers. The format itself has seen few changes
over the course of the Internet’s history aside from the
emergence of the snippet. However, there are indications
that the result presentation format is undergoing some
evolutionary changes. The discussion will examine
primarily the structural aspects of alternative formats to
the traditional list format and motivate a program of
comparative evaluation. A summary of current structure
templates provides a resource for designers of future
result visualisations.

A viable successor to the rank-ordered list is more a
question of the fundamental theoretical challenges than
technological. It is likely that the infrastructure required
to efficiently present search results within internet
browser environments already exists in some toolkit or
web service form. We have been investigating these
toolkits and web services to build and evaluate
experimental interfaces and in particular, using a Mozilla
Firefox extension to deliver experiments over the Internet.

Introduction
Visualisation based approaches to search result
presentation are growing in prevalence across the Internet.
Evaluation must continue to show how these approaches
minimise the deficiencies and maximise cognitive
efficiencies of the de-facto standard ranked-ordered list.
Toward this goal, we are attempting to scrutinize core
components that all visualisations share to some degree;
namely, the spatialization of documents and the
representation of relationships between those documents.

The next section canvases some of the advantages
and disadvantages of the ranked-ordered list format. The
subsequent section then introduces our initial efforts to
capture different spatialization paradigms for search result
presentation. The final section outlines a browser-based
tool that we anticipate using for a comparative evaluation
of several different reduced-form search result
visualisations. Our browser-based tool will serve our
research program as well as provide a useful information
retrieval tool for participants even after the end of the
experiment.

The rank-ordered list has serviced a myriad diversity
of information need. However, the generic rank-ordered
list is increasingly inadequate for navigation of large
quantities of information. There is evidence of some
serious attempts at producing viable alternatives to the list
format [8]. The Internet hosts a number of examples that
propose cognitive amplification for specific stages [19] of
the information retrieval process; for example, query
formulation and initiation of search [39], review of
results[20, 21, 23], refinement of result set [20], and use
of results [20, 24].

1. Rank-ordered result presentation
A rank-ordered list has several advantages. Its
format is lean, ubiquitous and scalable; consistent, simple
and intrinsic; and user and task inclusive. Such
characteristics are easily measured and so early
optimisations have realised. However, the rank-ordered
list at present cannot support efficient and thorough
information search given the high prevalence of irrelevant
and unrelated results – due largely to an ongoing lack of
machine understanding of human language.

Spatial arrangement or position is a salient feature
for the representation of document relatedness. Although
relatedness is a subjective matter, a relationship may be
made explicit (e.g. an edge between nodes), or implicit
(e.g. based on point density). Current knowledge
regarding the merits of both approaches, especially in the
context of search result visualisation, is imprecise.
Comprehensive evaluation of the rudimentary spatial
component will expand on this knowledge. In pursuit of

The polysemous nature of language ensures that all
linguistic dialogue between human and machine is
ambiguous and that the result set contains many unrelated
or partially related documents. However, there is no
indication of relationships within and between rankordered results [6]; in reality, the searcher employs
cognition to make judgements ad-hoc and even then,

comparing the rank of two unrelated documents is
pointless [40]. Additionally, analysis of user behaviour
reveals that many results seldom receive equal portions of
attention [1, 10, 11]. A searcher would rather modify their
query than look further down the result list.

visualisation [30]; although, perceptual interpretation is
frequently subjective.
The mutual dependence of semantic and spatial also
raises issues of dimensionality, use of metaphor and
labelling of documents and labelling of the spatial
substrate. Information search typically deals with highly
dimensional documents – words, topics, themes – and so
analytical techniques [see 31, 45] are used to extract the
most representative dimensions. A critical aspect of this
process is the degree of information loss during
dimension reduction [45]. Subsequently, the number of
dimensions visualised becomes important. We have
deliberately chosen to focus on two-dimensional
visualisation as evidence suggests that two dimensions are
better than or as good as three dimensions [41, 46].
However, omission of three-dimensional visualisation
undervalues the use of metaphor that may benefit the
navigation of information space. For instance, a cityscape
metaphor in which buildings represent documents
elucidates concepts such as relatedness (proximity) and
clusters of related documents (neighbourhoods) [40].

The rank-ordered list is chiefly static in nature and
this may disadvantage information search and
exploration. A dynamic and interactive interface opens a
new channel of dialogue between human and machine,
thus potentially amplifying and externalising cognition to
the benefit of decision-making and acquisition of
information. Examples include sorting, filtering and
provision of feedback and ratings that a search engine
may act on autonomously. Regarding the latter, there is an
optimisation necessary between the degree of interactivity
offered and the degree of automation [25]. Nevertheless,
a richer interaction dialogue will likely offer greater
insight into the knowledge acquisition process. Thus
investigating alternative result interfaces will produce
both useful tools and new understanding of human
cognition.
In order to reach mainstream, open-domain search,
alternatives to the rank-ordered list must possess lean,
generic, consistent and inclusive characteristics as well as
a greater propensity to benefit human cognition during
search. As new alternatives emerge [e.g. 20, 47, 49] it is
practical to make comparative evaluation of contending
approaches and ascertain the core components that
enhance cognition during search.

Subjective interpretation of labels and aesthetics
similarly highlights the mutual dependence of semantic
and spatial. Labels can synopsise the content of individual
documents and document clusters. Labels also define the
structure and context of the domain of search and this is
beneficial for first time searchers [7]. However, a
compromise is necessary between aesthetics and
functionality and remains a challenge shared by the wider
visualisation community [32, 33]. Appropriate length,
clarity, content and expressiveness impact on aesthetics
including the degree of occlusion, readability,
unambiguous referral [32], distribution, consistency [33]
and local and global clutter [15]. User behaviour further
confounds the need for compromise. Whilst users use 2-3
words to search for documents [16] they typically use 2-3
times that number to describe documents [38]; this
exemplifies one such trade-off necessary between the
descriptive power of labels and aesthetics.

2. Visualisation based result presentation
A diverse collection of visualisation-based search
tools is available [8] though any associated evaluation
seldom succeeds in elucidating the merits of their basal
properties including spatial layout and labelling. Figure 1
illustrates our initial efforts to capture the diversity of
these search tools and motivates a program of evaluation.
We deliberately omit non-essential aesthetics to facilitate
comparison of spatial layout. It abstracts away from the
inessential and is therefore proposed as a reference for
designers and in particular, those who wish to carry out
comparative evaluation. As we have removed aesthetic
debris, figure one emphasises primarily visualisation of
inter-document relationships rather than document
attributes [42].

In contrast, users have criticised interfaces that do
not show immediately accessible result surrogates [34] so
showing no labels at all is less than ideal. Presenting
several results at once on demand [32] eliminates the need
for concomitant number of mouse clicks, which although
initially light work, can become illusorily tedious and
repetitive with time. Moreover, presenting only one result
at a time in a fixed screen location [20, 22, 35] provokes
discontinuity and makes difficult the task of comparing
documents.

Spatialization has two interdependent characteristics;
the first one is semantic and specifies the basis for interdocument relationships, the second is spatial and specifies
how best to represent those relationships visually [28].
Semantic relationships depend on analysis of a ‘sampling
unit’ such as Metadata or thematic content [31], whereas
spatial relationships depend on visual perceptions of
correspondence,
differentiation,
connectivity and
arrangement [43]. These are important to consider
because high semantic coherence and spatial grouping
influence the users’ cognitive processing of the

Finally, the last row of figure one, added for
completeness, illustrates how labelling need not be
textual. Several approaches utilise iconic [36, 37] and
chart-based [57, 18] representation for the labelling of
semantic content within documents, while thumbnail
previews facilitate comparison and recall of documents
based on visual signatures [22, 47].

several visualisations. As the searcher interacts with the
interface, the extension reports anonymous usage
statistics. Of particular interest will be the relative
portions of time spent using specific visualisation
formats, query construction, search tasks, use of relevance
feedback etc.

3. Browser extension as evaluation tool
The potential scope for comparative evaluation of
search result visualisation is quite large. In preparation for
comparative evaluation, we are investigating browserbased technologies and web services as a way to deliver
experiments and collect data. Online, web-based and outof-the-laboratory experimentation is increasingly common
and has a number of proponents [12, 13, 14]. There are
many benefits to online delivery of experiments [12, 14,
17] including cost savings and broad demography.
Our evaluation tool is encapsulated within a Mozilla
Firefox browser Extension [26]. To install the extension
the participant downloads a XPI ‘zippee’ archive,
containing program and interface script. They open this
file using Mozilla Firefox, which then automates the
install process. Uninstalling the extension is a simple onestep process initiated within the Add-ons Manager of
Firefox.
Central to our evaluation tool are the interactive
visualisations. There exist a number of browser-based
technologies to produce graphical visualisations that run
within or draw directly on a web page [4, 5, 9]. Our
extension utilises canvas HTML5 element [27] and
JavaScript for drawing and interactivity. The use of these
generic technologies ensures that the evaluation is highly
portable. In an earlier investigation utilising Java Applets
for visualisation capability, we noticed a high degree of
experiment drop out due to versioning issues with
incorrect Java Runtime Environment.
With sufficient parameterisation, our evaluation
extension can provide a useful information retrieval tool
for participants following the evaluation. This is mutually
beneficial in that we reward participants with a usable
search tool, whilst they continue to provide a stream of
interactive information retrieval data. Furthermore, added
functionality is possible by passing search results
obtained from Google, Yahoo or custom search services
[e.g. 56] to a Java program running on the Java Runtime
Environment. This allows the possibility to perform more
sophisticated processing including custom clustering,
user-feedback analysis, and maintenance of search
histories. As a result, we envision this tool as a basis for
an integrated suite of knowledge management tools and
over time envision that users can download and plug-in
new visualisations that integrate with our tool.

Conclusions
In the minimum, any viable alternative to the rankordered list format for web search results will need to
address everything wrong with the list format; moreover,
it must achieve everything that the list format can do
exceedingly well. If it is possible to compete with the
generic result list format, it is highly possible that most of
the technical infrastructure already exists to do so.
Ongoing evaluation must continue to compare the
various spatialization approaches (and their textual
annotation) to search result visualisation. Our collation of
reduced form examples is proposed to facilitate a program
of comparison and evaluation. In preparation for such an
evaluation, we have been investigating the use of an
internet browser extension as a delivery mechanism. Our
evaluation extension uses browser-based technologies
capable of displaying interactive visualisations. We
believe our approach is mutually beneficial, as the
extension will provide a useful information search tool for
participants while delivering an ongoing source of
interactive information retrieval data.

Figure 2 illustrates the general architecture of the
current extension and its extended functionalities. To
initiate a search the user types a query into the extension’s
browser-toolbar search box and executes the search. The
extension logs the query and requests results from the
source. The extension downloads results and passes them
to a Java program for linguistic processing and
transformation. The result interface opens as a new tab
and the user is free to interact with results in a number of
formats including sorted list, clustered list, or one of
