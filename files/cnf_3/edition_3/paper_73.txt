Abstract

1.1 Related work

How can the prestige of research centres forming
part of scientific co-authorship networks focused on
Physiology and Pharmacology be measured?
This paper attempts to answer that question on the
basis of a bibliometric analysis of Spanish scientific
production in these areas of research between 1995 and
2005 as listed in Thomson Reuters’ Science Citation
Index Expanded. An affinity index is used to measure the
asymmetric co-authorship relationships between any two
institutions on the collaboration network to obtain the
hub and authority values for the leading institutions. The
spatial distribution of network nodes is mapped with the
Kamada Kwai algorithm. The findings identify the
centres of greatest prestige from the standpoint of coauthorship of scientific papers.

Today’s interest in the analysis of the factors that
contribute to node status in the context of bibliometric
citation or scientific co-authorship networks is the result
of the success of the Google page ranking algorithm
[10]. Generically based on an iterative process of
calculating both the number of links received by a
website and the status of the sites hosting those links, it
has become a standard for evaluating website status.
Based on this approach, new bibliometric indicators
have been suggested to evaluate academic publications
or the impact of their authors [11]-[12] against the
backdrop of a review of the ways to measure the
influence of academic publications and the agents and
organizations constituting the scientific system. Katy
Börner used weighted links and graph visualization
techniques to analyze research teams through coauthorship networks with a view to identifying a new
scientific field such as information visualization [13].
Leydesdorf detected the emergence of a world-wide core
of countries that have collaborated most intensely since
the nineteen nineties [14].

1. Introduction
Many co-authorship networks have been studied to
explore the structural properties of scientific
collaboration [1]-[2] by social scientists drawn to the
subject by the awareness that such networks contain all
the ingredients of small worlds in their make-up [3],
while also reflecting the dynamic aspects that govern the
development of such complex systems [4]. Their
findings have shown that in these scale-free networks
development is governed by the principle of preferential
attachment [5] and the vertex degree and connection
strength distributions by a power law [6].
This article examines the values of hubs and
authorities [7] found from Web of Science data for the
network of pharmacological papers co-authored by
Spanish companies and Spanish public research bodies
such as universities and hospitals. It constitutes a
continuation of prior studies on proposals to contribute to
the measurement of co-authorship network actors’ status
or influence [8]-[9].

2. Method
2.1 Data collection
The data used in this study were drawn from the
Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded)
database contained in Thomson Reuters’ Web of
Knowledge, downloaded in January 2008. In the first
phase, all types of papers in which Spain appeared in the
address field and which were published from 1995 to
2005 were retrieved from the base. In the second phase, a
sub-set of papers was defined to include only those with
standardized company addresses. A total of 1 557 papers
(articles, biographical items, book reviews, corrections,
editorial materials, letters, meeting abstracts, news items
and reviews) published by Spanish research bodies were
retrieved, 760 of which had been written jointly. Each
paper was assigned to an institutional sector based on
individual authors’ institutional affiliation. The following
classification was used: private enterprise, health system,
university system, government, Spanish National

Research Council (CSIC), CSIC mixed centres, public
research bodies (EPI) and others not classifiable in any
of the aboce categories.
One of the problems that arises in bibliometric
analyses of scientific disciplines is the criteria for
classifying papers by scientific area. In large-scale
analyses, the only practical way to allocate papers by
area consists in using the subject categories into which
the ISI’s Journal Citation Reports (JCR) divides the
journals where they are published. These ISI categories
have subsequently been subdivided to establish more
refined schemes such as the ANEP classification chosen
for the present analysis. ANEP, the Spanish National
Agency for Evaluation and Prospective Studies, is a
Ministry of Science and Innovation body under the aegis
of the Secretariat of State for Universities [15]. Coauthor distribution by sectors is given in Table 1, while
Table 2 shows the bibliometric parameters.

2.2 Tools
Variations on organizations’ names may distort the
results of bibliometric analysis: different spellings,
typographical errors, misuse of upper case, abuse of
initials or abbreviations or mistakes in transliteration. To
obviate these difficulties, ad hoc software was used that
avoids homonymy by combining author and institution
and synonymy by combining author and paper and
corrects the lack of precision in institutional
denominations [16].

2.3 Matrix generation
Calculating co-authorship from the database
described at the paper level initially yielded symmetric
or 1-mode matrices. Institutions were counted using full
accounting, which attributes a value of “1” to each
institutional author of an article whenever an institution
appears in the set of papers. Co-authorship was therefore
defined in terms of authors’ institutional affiliation.
Absolute co-authorship values were used in the
calculations.
When applying visualization techniques to
bibliometric co-authorship networks, one aspect to be
borne in mind is the graphic representation of the
direction of the relationship or link established by
collaborating universities, and the effectiveness of that
collaboration. The existence of collaboration between
two countries, institutions or persons implies reciprocity,
but provides no insight into the degree of dependence of
one or the other. The degree of dependence may vary
among organizations, for collaboration may not be
symmetric. Confirmation or reciprocity is an important
property of links in network analysis. Confirmation is not
defined simply by the existence of the link, but by the
degree to which the value of reciprocity is the same in
the various nodes in the network.
Such dissimilarity in the degree of collaboration
between universities is represented by computing the
asymmetric collaboration rate and mapping the interuniversity collaboration network, in which asymmetry is
denoted by the differences in the direction of the arrows
between nodes. This indicator, borrowed from the
affinity index used to measure asymmetric relations

between two countries [17], was adapted here to estimate
asymmetric collaboration between two organizations.
It was calculated from formulas used to measure the
direction of cooperation between any two nodes, as
follows:
COA ( Insti1 ↔ Insti2 )

Sta Creu & Sant Pau Univ.
Hosp.
Salamanca Hosp. Complex
Univ of Valencia
San Carlos Univ. Hosp.

TCA ( Insti1 → Insti 2 ) =
× 100
COA ( Insti1 ↔totalclass )
COA ( Insti2 ↔ Insti1 )

TCA ( Insti 2 → Insti1 ) =
× 100
COA ( Insti2 ↔totalclass )

where TCA is the asymmetric collaboration rate between
institutions 1 and 2, COA (Insti1Å>Insti2) is the total
number of papers co-authored by institutions 1 and 2
and COA (Insti1<ÆTotalclass) is the total set of papers coauthored by institution 1. This yields a directed network
from which prestige values can be computed for the
nodes.
The present study calculated the values of hubs and
authorities. Nodal hub score is proportional to the
combined authority score, and authority score is
proportional to the combined hub score of in-neighbors.
That is, nodal hub score becomes higher initially if the
node has more out-neighbors, but it is affected by the
authority scores of its out-neighbors. So, if a node has
many out-neighbors which have low authority scores,
hub score of that node will be low. Nodal authority score
is similar to hub score, but it is affected by in-neighbors.
In addition, authority score of a node is also affected by
hub scores of its in-neighbors. In the present study, two
weights, Xv, Yv Є [0,1], were computed for each vertex v
to determine its value as an authority and a hub. Vertex V
is regarded to be a better authority than vertex U if
Xv>Xu. Weights were computed according to network
solving the eigenvector problems of matrices AAT (hubs)
and AT A (authorities) [18]. The Kamada Kwai algorithm
[19] was used to map two asymmetric collaboration
networks (Figure 2) for institutions with more than four
co-authored papers.

3. Results
The findings are given in Tables 3 and 4, where
institutions are ranked in descending order of their
authority/hub weights.

In Figure 2, nodes are only connected by lines when
at least four papers were written jointly for publication
by researchers affiliated with the two respective
institutions. The initial network of 470 nodes was thus
reduced to 116. In both figures, the size of the node is
proportional to the volume of co-authored production,
the intensity of the colour of the link indicates the
dimension of the asymmetric collaboration rate and the
direction of the arrow denotes the direction of
collaboration among network nodes. In Figure 2, the
colour of the node indicates the sector to which the
institution is assigned.

4. Discussion
The network studied contained 470 institutions that
co-authored 760 papers on pharmacology published
between 1995 and 2005. The resulting network illustrates
how institutions inter-relate in terms of the degree of
scientific co-authorship. The diagram generated is
asymmetric: some institutions co-authored studies with
different types of organizations, whereas some research
centres collaborated nearly exclusively with other
research centres.
This initial exploratory paper identifies the centres
that roused the greatest interest as partners. The
University and Provincial Hospital at Barcelona, La Fe
University Hospital at Granada, and Valle de Hebrón
General University Hospital at Barcelona proved to be
good authorities, followed at a significant distance by the
University of Barcelona (0,22) and Ramon & Cajal
Hospital at Madrid (0,21). Health system institutions
prevail in the list of top institutional authorities, along
with four universities (U. of Barcelona, Autonomous U.
of Barcelona, U. of Valencia and U. of Oviedo). The
network in Figure 2 can be used as a basis for discussion
of a number of interesting characteristics of the structure
of the Spanish co-authorship network and contributes to
the understanding of the mechanisms used to create coauthorship links by different types of organizations
engaging in scientific production in the area.

5. Conclusions

[13]

The present preliminary analysis of co-authorship
data establishes the prestige of the university hospitals at
Barcelona, Seville and Zaragoza in the Spanish
physiology and pharmacology network. The main
network authorities, located there, have co-authorship
ties with universities in Barcelona and Oviedo, while
their working relations with private enterprise are much
less intense. The algorithm presumes that a good hub is
an organization that connects to many others and a good
authority an organization to which many others connect.
These provisional results constitute a stimulus to
continue the study of real co-authorship networks, and to
apply the findings of social network analysis.
