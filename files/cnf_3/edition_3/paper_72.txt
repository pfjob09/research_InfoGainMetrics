Visualizing a cocitation network is an important
technique employed by information scientists to illustrate
the intellectual structure of a knowledge domain. A
cocitation network is usually visualized by drawing an
undirected arc between two articles that are cocited by
other papers. The contextual information, i.e., information
regarding papers citing these cocited articles, is
suppressed and therefore invisible. We demonstrate a
novel approach that uses the citation network itself to
reveal cocitation relationships. The preserved contextual
information of the cocitation network reveals the indirect
relationships between clusters of cocited nodes that may
facilitate the exploration of interdisciplinary studies.

AuthorLink [2], which is a Web-based author
searching system, accepts a single author’s name as input
and provides a list of 24 authors who are most often
cocited with the designated author as output. CitesSpace II
[3] and its predecessor is a Java application for analyzing
and visualizing cocitation networks. Pajek [4] was applied
to visualize the cocitation matrix using the build-in springbased algorithm by Leydesdorff and Vaughan [5]. All afore
mentioned systems show a cocitation graph as a network of
nodes connected by undirected arcs. Chen and Hsieh
demonstrated a cocitation visualization system, which
displays cocitation relationship by the proximity of the
cocited nodes [6].

1. Introduction
3. Visualization Contextual Information of a
Cocitation Network

The visualization of cocitation network is an important
technique for information scientists to illustrate the
intellectual structure of a knowledge domain. A cocitation
network is usually visualized by drawing an undirected arc
between two articles that are cocited by other papers. Two
papers are cocited when a third paper cites them both. A
cocitation network is always visualized by drawing an
undirected arc between two cocited nodes [1, 2, 3]. Figure
1 shows a typical cocitation network.

3.1. The Visualization Platform
We used prefuse [7] to develop a system to
demonstrate our ideas. In contrast with the traditional
cocitation visualization approach that explicitly shows an
undirected edge to represent a cocitation relationship, our
system shows the cocitation relationships implicitly by
placing the cocited nodes close to each other, as shown in
Figure 2. The cocitation relationship is visualized via a
citation graph. The body of the citation arc is drawn in
light gray with a green colored arrow head pointing to the
cited node. The green arrow head is meant to highlight the
direction of an arc. A pleasing side effect of the cluttered
green arrow heads is that the nodes pointed by them will
glow green. The cocited nodes can be visually identified
with ease, since they are highlighted by the light green
color. The position of nodes and clusters composed by
them in the display pane are based on the equilibrium of
three interacting forces: the spring force, the drag force,
and N-body force. The spring force is the force exerted by

Figure 1 A typical cocitation whereas node 529,
530, and 531 are cocited; node 408, 409, and 556
are cocited

a compressed or stretched spring upon any object which is
attached to it. A citation arc is equivalent to a connecting
spring in our case. The simulated spring force is utilized to
draw an aesthetic graph, i.e., a graph without edgecrossing. The drag force implements a viscosity force to
help stabilize nodes in the N-body or spring force
simulation. The N-body force is a force that exerts in a Nbody simulation [8], which is analogous of the formation
of cosmic structure under the influence of gravitational
force. It simulates massive particles under the influence of
physical forces, usually gravity, but sometimes also
magnetic or electric forces.

4. Case Studies
We drew the citation data from the online citation
database CiteSeer [9]. Our citation data collection
procedure applies the CiteSeer citation index by utilizing
key phrases to query the index and retrieve all matching
documents from it. The documents retrieved by the query
are then used as the initial seed set to retrieve papers that
are citing or are cited by literatures in the initial seed set
[10]. The full citation graph is built by linking all articles
retrieved, which include many more documents than the
traditional citation expansion schemes that only search
references found in the initial set of papers retrieved by a
query. The resulting citation graph was built from the
literatures and citation information retrieved using the term
“Information Visualization” (IV) to query CiteSeer during
February, 2007. The initial seed set contains 947 qualified
IV-related literatures. The complete citation graph contains
695,171 document nodes and 1,858,996 citation arcs. To
keep the citation graph in a manageable size, We pruned
out those cocited literatures that were published prior to
1995 from the graph. The pruned graph then included
literatures that were cocited over 60 times and published on
or after 1995. It contains 2,910 nodes and 7,461 arcs, as
depicted in Figure 3.

Figure 2 The contextual information of the cocited
nodes in Figure 1 is displayed

3.2. Visualizing the Contextual Information of a
Cocitation Graph
There are two clusters of cocited nodes in Figure 1.
The citing nodes of these two clusters of cocited nodes
won’t be displayed by the conventional cocitation graph as
shown in Figure 1. The contextual information of citing
nodes is displayed as shown in Figure 2. A group of
cocited nodes became a cluster of nodes whereas the
cocited nodes form the core of the constituent cluster. The
two disjoined clusters in Figure 1 turn out to be connected
by a node – node number 1074. Our system displays the
focused node in red color; the color of a focused node turns
from the default color baby blue into red. The color of
adjacent nodes to a focused node turns orange. We can see
from Figure 1 that the focused node is node 1074 and the
adjacent nodes are two clusters of cocited nodes. A cluster
of highly cocited nodes represent a focus of study or a
specialty in a research domain. A bridging node between
two specialties implies a synergic study between these two
specialties may exist, and the bridging node is the key.

Figure 3 The citation graph built from the
“Information Visualization” dataset
There are four disjoin components in Figure 3, and 66
highly cocited literatures form the cores of the constituent
clusters of these components. The clusters are formed by
literatures citing these core literatures. Two of the
components consist of one cluster. Another component has
two clusters in it. The largest component consists of 17
clusters. The cluster with three core nodes (529, 530, 531)
depicted in Figure 4 is among one of the 17 clusters. The
largest component in Figure 3 consists of clusters that
represent highly relevant but sometimes not so related subfields of study. The constituent clusters of this component
are listed in Table 1.

these two unrelated topics seem to be bridged by a node.
The relationship between the study of decentralized lookup
service and RF-based location tracking systems is an
interesting topic. Their relationship is derived from two
articles that cite them both; the 1074 node highlighted in
Figure 2 is one of them. These two connecting articles
discuss the topic of data-centric storage in a sensornet,
which is made up of many tiny wireless sensing devices.
The main function of a sensornet is to collect data over
wide geographic areas. Since the data is more important
than the identity of the node that gathers them, a datacentric approach is applied to address the data
dissemination issue. The data sources locating mechanism
embedded in a decentralized lookup service of a typical
P2P network is therefore utilized by the sensornet. Sensors
in a sensornet need to track the location of other sensors
via RF-based communication to facilitate energy
conservation during data disseminating operations. The
sensornet study could have not been discovered had the
contextual background information was not revealed.
Similarly, a bridging node between three studies may
represent an interesting cross-topics study. In addition to
the two studies included in Figure 4, the study of routing
protocols for ad hoc networks is included in Figure 5. The
underlying paper represented by the highlighted node in
Figure 5 tried to provide an integrated solution of routing
and storage for applications in a mobile ad hoc network.

of the cocitation graph whereas the cocitation
relationship is implied by their proximity

Conclusions

Cluster 4.11 and 4.13, represents the study of
decentralized lookup service and RF-based location
tracking systems, respectively. The study of decentralized
lookup service tries to develop schemes that efficiently
determine the node that stores a requested data item by
other nodes in a distributed network. As shown in Figure 2,

We demonstrate a novel approach that uses the citation
network itself to reveal cocitation relationships. The
preserved contextual information of the cocitation network
may reveal the relationships, which are not shown by the
conventional cocitation visualization approaches. The

revealed relationship between clusters of cocited nodes
may facilitate the exploration of interdisciplinary studies.
We use a case to illustrate how a cross-topics study is
uncovered by the contextual information of the cocitation
network. The result of the cocitation visualization
complemented by a domain content analysis is
encouraging. We are able to visualize citation information
that is usually suppressed by the traditional cocitation
pruning process. With the augmented contextual
information, interesting cross-fields researches may be
uncovered straightforwardly. It will help us to explore the
connections between research topics if we can overlap an
exiting cocitation network with its contextual citation
information.
