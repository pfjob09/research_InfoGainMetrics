Abstract

ness for tracking user interactions within visualizations. A critical aspect not addressed by earlier approaches is the challenge of discovery activities that
span tools, systems, individuals and locations.
The framework (Figure 1) addresses the challenge
of tracking across multiple systems and tools by first
creating a generalized model of the visualization process. The building blocks of this model are:

Modern knowledge discovery activities occur in
highly dynamic environments. Specific activities
may involve multiple tools, techniques, systems, individuals, and locations. In addition to these complexities, the span of time involved with discovery
may vary from short to long, as well as being contiguous or disjoint. This paper presents a framework for tracking the history, or provenance, of the
discovery process across applications, systems, and Session: A logical collection of activities initiated

which linked together all of the information sources
that a person accessed, or would need to access.[2]
The TaskTracer system [7] keeps track of activities
across applications and files.
The history of parameter setting, or pre-processing
information is a slightly different approach. For visualization systems [15, 6, 19] and more recently
[3, 1] have looked at the problem along with manaagement of the data mapping to the visualization
space.[5, 14] Histories for web searching focus on
web navigation.[13, 21, 22, 17]
In addition to specific projects described above,
this project relates to sense-making [16, 18], which
seeks to synthesize multiple sources of information.
Ultimately, as described in [20], there is a clear and
urgent need for tools and frameworks to support the

activity, which creates a type of branching relationship between actions.
A third type of linkage between actions occurs
across activities, which we call an association. Such
relationships can be implicitly or explicitly defined.
An implicit relationship between one action and the
actions in other activities is defined as the set of actions within the session that immediately preceed the
action in question. Inter-action relationships might
also be explicitly defined in subsequent analysis by
the user. Figure 2 shows examples for each of the
different types of representations that we currently
support.
The remainder of this paper is structured in the
following way. In Section 2 we describe work that
is related to this research. Section 3 provides the
design of the history tracking framework. The prototype system used to explore the problem space is
described in Section 4. Lastly, we summarize our
results in Section 5.

2 Related Work
A number of projects have looked at the problem of
history tracking for visual exploration [10, 9, 11, 12,
8], each of which is concerned with tracking within a
single application. The earliest vision of the type of

In this section we provide details on the history tracking framework. The model we originally proposed
[9] assumed a directed graph of interactions. The
nodes of the graph contained information describing
the state of the system being used, and edges illustrated transitions between the states. While the original model was sufficient for behaviors within a single
environment, it is too simplistic for multiple environments.
In order to be precise with our description of
the model we will utilize the following definitions.

discrete interactions, such as zoom, rotate, translate,
or other interactions as described in [4]. The simple
linear case represents a user switching between applications. Branching behavior occurs when a user
reverts to an earlier state of an activity via interacting
with the exploration history. Different graphical representations of the graph can be supported, as shown
in Figure 2.

, which is a subset of the actions
within a session. Informally, an association can be
considered the set of last actions taken by a user
within each of the activities in a session. Accordingly, each action exists within an implied association.
In contrast with the highly fluid nature of implicit
associations, an explicit association is defined according to user input. In order to support explicit associations we utilize a tagging scheme, which grows
as a user creates new tags and assigns them to actions. Tags may have either local (within an activity), regional (within a session), or global (across
sessions) context, depending on how the user wishes
to interact. Sometimes, a word does not express the
meaning of an association, in which case a system
generated tag can be used to create an association
between actions.

to support clustering of actions, and supports alternate graph representations of the exploration based
on the clusters.

4 Implementation and Interaction
Coordinating exploration activities across multiple
applications introduces several new challenges, including:
1. How should different actions applied to data be
visually represented?
2. How should the different applications used be
visually represented?
3. What mechanism should be used for organizing
the exploration activities?
Our initial project [9, 10] was successful at
demonstrating how to track and represent visual explorations for a single system. For the initial system we utilized a directed graph drawn as a tree to
represent the interactions. We retain the same visual
layout to represent the interactions, but have updated
the interface significantly. Our updated provenance
interface is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: One design for the display is to represent
activities as unique colored edges on the graph. Tags
associated with the session are shown on the left, and
actions associated with the tags are outlined in the
graph.

We utilize coloring on the edges of the graph to
represent different activities. Gradient color is used
to represent shifting from one activity to another. We
also provide a tagging interface on the display, which
allows the user to create new tags and add them to the
different interaction states.
Icons are selected according to user preference
when an activity is encountered. The screenshot
shown in Figure 4 illustrates an example where the
user alternated between visualization activities and
web browsing activities. Figure 5 gives an idea how
the different activities are mapped onto the display.

Figure 4: Interface with a mixture of types of applications - in this case, internet browsing and visualization. The different icons represent the type of
exploration data (web page, molecule).
Our current implementation utilizes two different
interfaces for recording history. The first is based

on a simple TCP/IP communication protocol. The
provenance monitor runs as a background process
and listens to a user-defined port. The port is used
by client applications for transmitting actions and
for the provenance monitor to communicate state
changes back to the client. For example, as changes
occur in the client visualization system they are sent
to the monitor. Each is compared to the last action
recorded, and the interaction graph is extended horizontally if the last action is a terminal leaf node. If
the last action is not a terminal node, then a branch
is created in the graph.
When the user interacts directly with the action on
the provenance interface, the monitor sends a message back to the client. The message contents are
identical to what was transmitted by the client, and
the system assumes that client applications can deal
with the data appropriately, and set the state of the
system acoordingly. The over-arching design of the
model is to localize specific knowledge of the activity to the application where the activity occurs,
thereby freeing the provenance interface from dealing with application specific data.

5 Conclusion
Visualization provide insight into data which is otherwise not accessible to most users. In this project
we have focused on the challenge of tracking the process of visual exploration. Given a rich collection
of the provenance of discoveries, as envisioned by
this research, users will be equipped to re-examine,
recreate, and share their discoveries in fundamentally
new and powerful ways.
Annotation plays a critical role in the exploration
process, in that it provides a mechanism for users to
capture their observations of what they are seeing in
the visualization. In this project we enhanced the annotation capabilities of users by adding the ability to
tag their actions. Because each action is linked back
in the context of an activity, which is in turn linked
into an exploration session, the tagging provides a
platform for reasoning about and comparing exploration actions.
We have several extensions underway with this
project. First, we are developing an API for the
provenance interface to allow other technology developers to link their applications into the prove-

nance tracking system. Second, we are exploring automated tagging schemes based on the features of the
visualization. Third, we are designing a detailed user
study of the technique employed in life science discovery tasks.
One area in which we have major plans is collaborative discovery. Because our current implementation uses a simple TCP/IP communication mechanism, we are exploring ways in which the technical
infrastructure for collaborative discovery can be configured. In particular, we are interested in connecting
up multiple users to perform a joint discovery task.
We will further explore and understand how a shared
discovery history might evolve in such a setting.
