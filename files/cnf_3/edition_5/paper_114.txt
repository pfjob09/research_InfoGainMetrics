Abstract
Virtual Manufacturing (VM) applies Virtual Reality
(VR) technology to provide a digital manufacturing
solution in both 3D visual and interactive ways. It makes
VR no longer a state-of-the art but rather an innovation
technology to support modern industry. With the rapid
growth of network technology and Web 3D graphics
techniques, we propose a cost-effective distributed VM
system for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)
with limited equipment, funds and technical capabilities.
The system enables SMEs to perform collaborative tasks
including product design, manufacturing and resources
sharing through the World Wide Web (WWW) in lower
cost. This paper describes the design and critical
integration issues of the system and the use of the Web
3D technology – X3D. It also evaluates the distributed
VM system by comparing it to the conventional standalone CAD/CAM system.
Keywords: Virtual Manufacturing, World Wide Web,
X3D, SMEs.

1. Introduction
Virtual Manufacturing (VM) takes advantage of
Virtual Reality (VR) technology to provide a digital
manufacturing solution in both 3D visual and interactive
ways. It has shown us the powerful potentials of VR by
being combined in the latest generations of CAD/CAM
tools to aid product development. VM has made VR no
longer a state-of-the art but rather an innovation
technology to support modern industry [1]. Engineers
have applied VM in a wide range of manufacturing
applications: product design and prototyping, factory
layout design and visualization, assembly process
planning and simulations, machinist training, and so
forth [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. A VM system is based on a virtual
environment where a virtual manufacturing world can be
modelled, simulated, visualized and even interacted with
using immersive devices such as Head Mounted Displays
(HMDs), datagloves, force/touch feedback equipment
and so on [7]. Because of the complexity of product

development in reality, a database involved in a virtual
manufacturing environment must be very large in order
to create and represent complex scenarios as realistically
as possible. In addition, the platform dependence of
various VM systems results in incompatibility problems
and various 3D graphics data formats also create a
barrier for collaboration digital manufacturing.
At present, manufacturers demand to get to market
faster with new products. SMEs experience stronger
competitive pressures because of the limited equipment,
fund and technical capabilities. However, current
commercial VM systems are often expensive because of
the involvement of high performance graphics
accelerators, multiprocessor graphics workstations and
some dextrous immersive devices [8]. Thus, most SMEs
can't afford such high-cost VR systems and have a clear
preference for desktop VR systems over more immersive
HMD-based systems. With the rapid growth of network
technology, the World Wide Web (WWW) has become a
primary medium for information distribution, remote
communication and multimedia services via a clientsever approach. In conjunction with Web-based 3D
graphics techniques such as the latest X3D and MPEG-4
[9], researchers have applied VR technology to create a
virtual heritage, city or shop on the Web [10, 11].
Therefore, we believe that if a VM system can be
accessed on the Web, it's more effective and efficient for
SMEs to develop higher-quality products in less time and
at lower cost.
In this project, we aim to propose a cost-effective
distributed VM system for SMEs. The research was
based on the Innovative Product Development Centre
(IPDC) at Telford. The centre was established by the
University of Wolverhampton in order to assist SMEs to
become more competitive by sharing design and
manufacturing resources through the WWW. Figure 1
shows the overview of the IPDC. The centre includes a
digital manufacturing lab and a manufacturing workshop,
which contains several of the latest manufacturing
equipments including a rapid prototyping system, reverse
engineering
instruments,
high-speed
Computer-

Numerical-Control (CNC) machines and so on. The
digital manufacturing lab consists of VM systems,
several common commercial CAD/CAM packages such
as PTC's Pro/E Autodesk's AutoCAD, Delcams' Duct
CAD/CAM system and so on, and a knowledge-based
expert system for product assessments. Generally
speaking, it's impractical and unnecessary for every SME
to purchase all of the above valuable manufacturing
resources. Thus, the centre allows registered SMEs to
remotely access the product development environment
via Internet/Intranet for sharing resources. A client could
send a product design along with its specification to the
IPDC. After the design has been modified and optimised
by experts in this center, the actual prototype can be
produced for testing and evaluation. Then the final
accepted version is converted into the ComputerNumerically-Controlled (CNC) code for performing the
manufacturing process or is sent back to the client.
During the procedure, designers can discuss their ideas
and requirements with experts by email or networking
conference for collaboration working.

X3D
VM systems, as main components in the IPDC,
consist of a fundamental system and a Web-based system
for the Internet access. The fundamental system is an

This paper describes the design and critical
integration issues of the proposed system and the use of
the latest Web-based 3D technology - X3D. The
following section presents a distributed Web-based VM
system using X3D to create a sharing environment for
design and manufacturing applications. Section 3
describes the critical integration issues in such a
distributed VM system, which includes 3D geometric
modelling, VR simulation engine, and real time
interaction modes. Section 4 discusses the overall
evaluation of the proposed approach by comparing to the
conventional stand-alone CAD/CAM systems. Finally,

The engineers use a mouse, keyboard and dataglove to
immerse in a virtual manufacturing environment. Since
most SMEs do not need the full bandwidth of immersion,
a Web-based VM system was designed as a costeffective VR approach for SMEs to use for aiding
product development.
This section presents a Web-based VM system which
uses the WWW as the backbone to create a sharing
environment for its distribution. This system allows
multiple users (engineers, machinists and trainees etc.) to
access and explore some virtual manufacturing
applications at any sites or any time without specialised
computer platforms or software. Figure 2 shows the
system's framework.

The system consists of a digital manufacturing
database,
a virtual manufacturing
application
environment and an interface for the Internet access. The
database includes a Virtual Machine library (VM Lib)
along with design and manufacturing data. All 3D
modelling data are converted into X3D format. The X3D
as the Web 3D International Standard (ISO/IEC 19775)
using Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a
standardized, portable, and platform-independent way to
render dynamic interactive 3D scenes across the Internet
[12]. It represents static and animated dynamic 3D and
multimedia objects with hyperlinks to other media such
as text, images, sounds, and videos. The characteristic of
X3D is consistent with that of Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML). Therefore, an X3D world through an
X3D browser such as Flux Player can be seamlessly
embedded into the normal Web browser such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE). The user accesses and
navigates an X3D world downloaded from the Internet
server. In this way, X3D allows the delivery of such an
interactive VM system through the Internet to reach
potentially large number of users worldwide at any time.

simulation and analysis. It aids SMEs in reducing
risk and saving time before establishing a real
process flow.
Workshop layout—in order to get a cost-effective
and safe manual Workplace, the application allows
SMEs to design work places and equipment layout
before the start of production. An optimal workshop
layout design according to the rules of ergonomics
could maximise the efficiency of both workers and
equipment.

In addition, the virtual manufacturing environment
relies on a Web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for
Internet accesses. Java, JavaScript and X3D SAI (Scene
Access Interface) can be used to create a connection
between an external environment and the X3D scene
[13]. The Web-based GUI integrated X3D browser, Java,
JavaScript and SAI allows multiple users to interact and
communicate with virtual manufacturing applications
over the Internet.

3. Critical integration issues

By reducing costs and cycle time, the distributed
VM system is able to enhance and even accelerate the
major activities of manufacturing engineering, including:
concept development and simulation, optimising
assembly lines and workshops design, integrating labour
and equipment, etc.
Three major manufacturing
applications including machining, process planning and
workshop layout are prototyped based on the proposed
approach in the Web-based virtual manufacturing
environment.

The Web-based VM system allows multiple users
to access integrated manufacturing environments. Such
integrated environments simulate actual manufacturing
applications which could be interacted with through the
WWW. The critical integration issues in such a
distributed Web-based VM system include 3D geometric
modelling, VR simulation engine, and real time
interaction mode.

In a VM system, a 3D geometrical machine
model created(a)according to a real one is used to (b)
create a
virtual manufacturing world. A real machine consists of
many components, which are made up of different parts.

Machining—visualizes
and
analyzes
the
functionality of a machine. The application emulates
components, tools, controllers and workpiece along
with machining process. It aids SMEs to preview

and explore a new or valuable machine before its
purchase. Engineers and machinists can be trained
on the processes of a machine set-up, tools change
and production programs.
Process simulation—simulates a process flow in a
virtual workshop. It offers an opportunity for SMEs
to get the solution of choice for process flow

For example, a conventional milling machine comprises
a base, a working table, a head, main shaft, a servo motor
and a spindle motor, etc. In this project, a machine model
is constructed according to a part-component-machine
procedure and then imported them into the Virtual
Machine Library (VM Lib). X3D geometric modelling is
mainly based on geometric primitives such as cubes,

spheres, cylinders, cones, and so on. It is basically used
to model some components whose shapes are regular.
The various modelling methods are integrated to shorten
the system development cycle. For example, some
common machine models such as mills and lathes are
exported and converted into X3D format from a machine
library provided by some professional CAD/CAM
packages such as Deneb's Virtual NC and QUEST. In
addition, a professional geometric modelling package
such as Kinetix' 3D Studio Max or Pro/Engineer is used
to create some new types of machines. Similarly, the
model files are converted into X3D format via a
converter. However, the model's size could be very large
because each polygon is converted into an
IndexedFaceSet node description. In order to improve
download speed and navigation performance, a model
needs to be optimised by reducing the number of
polygons required.
X3D files exist in a scene graph hierarchical
structure. Models are subparts of the world. Such a
structure makes it easy to create large worlds or
complicated scenarios, which reuse subparts or inherit
attributes and behaviours from subparts. As a result, not
only a machine model but also its components or parts
can be reused in various manufacturing applications. For
example, Figure 3a shows a milling machine model used
in the machining application. Meanwhile, the model can
be reused as a subpart in a workshop layout application
shown in Figure 3b.

3.2 VR simulation engine
A dynamics machine and a process flow need to be
simulated according to the level of detail required. The
VR simulation engine plays an important role in
generating dynamic simulations. In this project, the
following mechanisms of X3D [14] have been used to
develop interactive dynamic behaviour simulations in the
distributed Web-based VM system.

different
types
of
interpolators:
PositionInterpolator,
OrientationInterpolator,
CoordinateInterpolator, and so forth. Each one
animates a different field type. For example, the
PositionInterpolator node is used to animate a
cutting tool's position along a motion path. Thus, a
PositionInterpolator
node
and
an
OrientationInterpolator node are combined to be
used to produce typical animated object motion. The
first moves the object along a motion path, while the
latter rotates the objects as it moves.
Sensor nodes. Detect and sense changes to the state
of an input device, changes in time, or changes
related to the motion of the viewer or objects in a
virtual world. They include TouchSensor,
CylinderSensor, SphereSensor, TimeSensor,
VisibilitySensor, and so forth. The TimeSensor
node generates events as time passes and is the basis
for all animated behaviors.
Script nodes. Define arbitrary behaviours by binding
the Java and JavaScript languages. Although
interpolator nodes don't support spline curve
interpolation, a script can directly implement the
mathematics of the curve interpolation.

Generally, Interpolator nodes are essentially builtin scripts that perform simple animation calculations.
They are usually combined with a TimeSensor node in
the scene graph to make objects move. For example,
PositionInterpolator node and TimeSensor node are
employed to define the moving of the working bed of a
mill along x-axis in specified time (see Figure 4a and
4b).
In addition, Physical Based Modelling (PBM) is an
important method to simulate animation and dynamic
behaviours in VR systems [15]. It can be integrated in
the VR simulation engine to generate highly realistic
animations based on physical dynamics implemented in
Java. Since some professional manufacturing simulation
packages such as Delmia's QUEST can directly emulate

real-world system behaviors, we intend to couple its
simulation capabilities to X3D worlds via a translator.
Figure 4c shows such a simulation of a process flow
through X3D browser.

3.3 Real time interaction mode
The distributed VM system provides users with an
intuitive Web-based GUI for Internet access and real
time interaction. A hierarchy-structural interface through
multiple HTML pages is prototyped in this project as
shown in Figure 5. The X3D worlds are individually
embedded in multiple HTML pages. Each world
represents a selected manufacturing application. The
Web-based GUI integrates X3D browser, Java applet and
X3D SAI to allow users to interact with applications in
real time. The Scene Access Interface (SAI) provides the
mechanism to communicate between Java applet and an
X3D scene graph. Each application's HTML page
contains Java applets running along side the X3D worlds.
As an input tool, the Java applet can manipulate and
update an X3D scene via the SAI and communicate
between the client and server.
The method takes advantage of the event-routing
mechanism of X3D. Some X3D nodes generate events in
response to environmental changes or user interaction.
These events can be propagated to effect changes in
other nodes. Once generated, events are sent to their
routed destinations in time order and processed by the
receiving node in X3D. This processing can change the
state of the node, generate additional events, or change
the structure of the scene graph in an X3D world. The
ideal event model processes all events instantaneously in
the order that they are generated. Using the Web-based
GUI, the Java applets routes input values from users or
updated data from the server to their destinations via
SAI. Moreover, it allows events to be processed based on
the order of user actions or the elapsed time between
events while keeping several related X3D scenes
synchronised.

4. Evaluation
The Web-based VR approach provides engineers
and designers with the capability to visualise, explore,
manipulate and interact with applications in a distributed
virtual environment to support design and manufacturing
for collaborative product development via the Internet.
This section evaluates the proposed approach in this
research project. Compared to a conventional stand-alone
CAD/CAM system, the proposed Web-based VM system
has considerable advantages:

5. Conclusions and future work
The cost-effective Web-based VM system allows
engineers and designers to visualize, explore, manipulate
and interact with manufacturing applications in a
distributed virtual environment. It allows SMEs to easily
reuse and widely share the design and manufacturing
resources through the WWW. By reducing costs and
cycle time of product development, such a distributed
VM system will accelerate the major activities of
manufacturing including: manufacturing process concept
development and simulation, optimising assembly lines
and workshops design, integrating labour and equipment,
and so forth.
Furthermore, we note that in reality, people always
play an essential role in every practical design and
manufacturing activity. Therefore, people such as
workers beside an assembly line need to be represented
in a virtual environment in some applications. In
particular, with the introduction of people models to a
workshop layout application, a layout design can be
enhanced according to ergonomics rules. Such
enhancement will aid the improvement of work
efficiency and the achievement of the full performance
of equipment. However, the integration of virtual
humans may result in overloading polygon rendering on
the limited network bandwidth because of its large data.
Since the proposed VR-based simulation system is

intended to be distributed across the Internet, navigation
speed must be considered to keep the sense of presence.
Thus, more effective methods [16, 17] need to be
explored in order to optimise the labour integration in the
Web-based VM system in future work. Furthermore,
multimedia issues such as video and network meeting
modules could be incorporated to improve real-time
discussion for collaboration working in order to enhance
the Web-based system on a broad base of manufacturing
and industrial applications for e-service via the Internet.
