Abstract
A set of algorithms has been developed and applied, in
order to quantify the morphology of structures produced
by our work on computer simulation of cancellous bone
remodelling. The set of algorithms is organised in three
themes, based on the set of metrics they compute. The
first one deals with the direct derivation of basic metrics
such as the trabecular thickness, separation and number.
The second deals with the area/volume distribution of
bone and marrow, while the third one considers surface
roughness and perimeter/area. The algorithms were
tested on sample sections of cancellous bone and applied
to a simulation of strain adaptation incorporating
complex multi-axial loading. The metrics have shown to
be independent of structural anisotropy, in contrast to
some established methods that assume certain
morphologies.
Keywords: histomorphometry, morphological indices,
direct derivation, simulation, strain-adaptation, cancellous
bone.

1. Introduction
Bone tissue consists of calcium hydroxyapatite
mineral absorbed onto a collagen matrix. Throughout life
there is a process of remodelling, where old bone is
removed by osteoclast cells and new collagen fibres are
laid down by osteoblast cells. This is under the control of
physical activity and several hormones. There are two
types of bone structure, cortical and cancellous. Cortical
bone is predominantly solid and makes up the shafts of the
long bones in the skeleton. Cancellous bone has a porous
structure made up of an array of trabecular bone fibres
interspersed with bone marrow, and is found near the joint
surfaces of the long bones and within the individual

vertebrae making up the spinal column. Bone grows
under body forces and the trabecular fibres follow the
principal lines of stress, as can be clearly seen, for
example, in a cross-section of the hip.
The analysis of the morphology of the structures
produced by our simulations [2, 8, 9] allows the indirect
validation of the simulations by comparing the results
with the literature and facilitates the investigation of
scenarios, such as the effects of structural characteristics
at the trabecular level to the structures’ stiffness.

2. Background
Parfitt et al [13, 14] introduced a method for
examining the structural changes that occur in trabecular
bone in aging and osteoporosis. With simultaneous
measurements of total perimeter and bone area in thin
sections, they derive indirect indices of mean trabecular
plate thickness (MTPT or Tb.Th) and mean trabecular
density (MTPD or Tb.N), such that trabecular bone
volume = MTPD×MTPT. MTPD is an index of a
probability that a scanning or test line will intersect a
structural element of bone, and is the reciprocal of mean
distance between the midpoints of structural elements,
multiplied by π/2. Several three-dimensional quantities
can be derived from the primary two-dimensional area and
perimeter length measurements. TBV (trabecular bone
volume or BV/TV) expressed as a percentage of total
tissue volume is identical with the two-dimensional
percentage area. Bone surface density (bone surface area
in square millimetres per cubic millimetre of tissue; Sv) is
obtained as follows:

Trabecular number (or density) is usually calculated
with dimension/length according to the parallel plate
model as

which is numerically equal to one-half of BS/TV (Bone

(6)

Trabecular spacing, defined as the distance between
midpoints, is given by 1/Tb.N and can also be measured
directly [17].
Muller and Hayes [12] study the use of direct methods
for determination of structural indices. They calculate BV
(bone volume) using tetrahedrons corresponding to the
enclosed volume of the triangulated surface used for the
surface area calculation. The total volume (TV) is the
volume of the whole examined sample. The bone surface
area (BS) is calculated using surface triangulation of the
binary data based on marching cubes [10]. The specific
bone surface or bone surface-volume-ratio is given by
BS/BV (roughness). In conventional stereology, these
primary parameters are then used to derive other indices
such as the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), the trabecular
separation (Tb.Sp) or the trabecular number (Tb.N) based
on the underlying model assumption.
A more direct approach to assess metric parameters
from three-dimensional images is based on measuring
actual distances in the three-dimensional space. Such
techniques do not rely on an assumed model type and are

therefore not biased by eventual deviations of the actual
structures from this model. In such a way, Tb.Th can be
calculated directly and without an underlying model
assumption by determining a local thickness at each voxel
representing bone [5]. The same method can be used to
calculate Tb.Sp by applying the thickness calculation to
the non-bone parts of the three-dimensional image. The
separation is thus the thickness of the marrow cavities.
Trabecular number (Tb.N) is defined for the plate model
as the number of plates per unit length. An alternative
geometrical interpretation can be formulated as the inverse
distance between the midsection of the plates. Another
parameter often used as an architectural index is the
geometrical anisotropy of a structure, which is typically
determined using mean intercept length (MIL)
measurements.
MIL denotes the average distance
between bone/marrow interfaces and is measured by
tracing test lines in different directions in the examined
volume of interest. From this measurement, a MIL tensor
can be calculated by fitting the MIL values to an ellipsoid.
The eigenvalues of this tensor can then be used to define
the degree of anisotropy (DA), which denotes the
maximum to minimum MIL ratio.
Cortet et al [1] discuss the shortcomings of using bone
mineral density (BMD) in the evaluation of mechanical
resistance and its relation to bone tissue structure. In
addition they are of the view that Parfitt's criteria
(trabecular thickness, number and separation) do not
adequately reflect the components of bone structure since
they are part of the information contained in bone mineral
density. In their review of methods for quantitative
analysis of trabecular bone structure they propose the starvolume method. The star-volume (or area) is the mean of
trabecular bone that can be accessed by continuous lines
extending from a random point. These lines can be seen
as trajectories of a small number of marbles cast in all
directions from a given point of the plane under
consideration and allowed to roll until they stop. Since
the star volume is calculated on a bone biopsy slice, it is
not a volume but a surface metric. The star volume
increases as trabecular connectivity decreases.

3. Morphological indices and algorithm
development
This section first presents new algorithms developed
for the direct determination of trabecular thickness,
separation and number in 2D and 3D structures.
Following this, a method for comprehensive determination
of star area and volume distribution is devised. Lastly
some indices are outlined that characterise the
density/sparsity, roughness and strain energy density
distribution.

3.1.

Trabecular thickness, number and
separation

As stated in [13], the indirect determination of
trabecular thickness based on an underlying model
assumption can lead to inaccurate results when the
structure being analysed deviates from the underlying
plate model assumption.
A way to directly calculate the mean trabecular
thickness of a structure is to fire rays into the structure at
different angles (over a half-circle or half-sphere) and
compute the mean, as proposed in [12]. This is shown
diagrammatically in Figure 1 for a 2D analysis and Figure
2 for a 3D analysis.

The two lines on the left and right hand sides of Figure
1 are rotated by θ degrees and the dotted lines (rays) fired
between them. The ratio of the total number of bone
elements met in the region of interest over the number of
times the rays change from marrow to bone give the mean
trabecular thickness for a particular ray. It is not
necessary to form a complete circle, as the measurement is
symmetric after 180°.
The process is similar in 3D, but the lines are replaced
with planes, where azimuth and elevation angles
determine the orientation of the planes. Similarly, the
measurement of marrow elements directly determines
Tb.Sp and the switch from marrow to bone Tb.N.
Consequently, the above can be summarised in the
following expressions:
Tb.Th2 D = f (θ )
(7)

Tb.Th3 D = g (azimuth, elevation )

(8)

To ensure that all elements are intersected when a ray
is fired through a region or volume of interest (ROI or
VOI), Bresenham’s line algorithm for 2D [3, 4] and an
adaptation of it in 3D are used. However, the above two
expressions return values in terms of the number of
elements travelled through and not the actual distance. A
conversion can be performed if the angle by which the
rays are fired is taken into account and subsequently used
to convert the measurements in elements in actual
distances travelled.

Star area and volume distribution

The star area or volume distribution (SAD or SVD)
described in [1] looks at the mean number of trabecular
elements that can be reached from continuous lines
extending from random points in marrow space.
Similarly, SAD and SVD can be calculated for bone,
starting from bone elements and extending lines until
marrow is met.
Because the results of these
measurements are highly influenced by the selection of
the centre from which the lines are extended, the proposed
method here is to perform the analysis from each element
of a 2D or 3D structure. In addition to the mean value for
marrow or bone space, the standard deviation also acts as
an additional indication of the anisotropy of the structures.
Consequently, for 2D problems all the structure
elements are scanned in turn and lines are fired uniformly
at different directions at angular intervals of 1°. When the
starting element is marrow, SAD.M is applied and when it
is bone, SAD.B is applied. The 3D algorithm is simply an
extension of the 2D case and lines are fired in a spherical
arrangement with azimuth ranging from 0° to 359° and
elevation from -90° to 90°. Due to the thoroughness of
the method, it takes almost two orders of magnitude
longer
to
calculate
SAD/SVD

than

Tb.Th/Tb.Sp/Tb.N, and the resultant data sets are also
significantly larger.

3.3.

Other structural indices

Other metrics that can be derived from structures
involve the BV/TV and MV/TV, which in effect show the
density and sparsity of sections of bone. The derivation of
these metrics is trivial, as it involves a simple count of the
bone and marrow elements and a division by the total
number of elements.
Perimeter is another metric that is used in the
calculation of a structure’s roughness. For 3D structures
the metric is called surface area and is best obtained by a
marching cubes algorithm [10] with smoothening based
on work by [15] and [6]. However, for reasons of
efficiency, look-up tables of 2×2 and 2×2×2 elemental
configurations can be valuable for the rapid calculation of
BS without subsequent smoothing. Here perimeter is
calculated with the simpler method of counting element
sides or faces [16], with slightly exaggerated results
compared to a marching cubes algorithm. Therefore
roughness is calculated as:

4. Application and results
The algorithms developed to characterise the
morphology of structures were tested on sample sections
of trabecular bone. These structures were obtained as
follows:
a. A set of slices from whale bone tissue samples1
were projected together so as to provide a
sufficiently connected trabecular structure with
initial density of ~40%.
b. A complex multiaxial loading scheme was applied
to the bone sample and the bone allowed to adapt
itself (depending on the strain energy density).
c. In total 33 cycles of adaptation were investigated
and the metrics calculated at each stage.
The above process was applied on the initial structure
of Figure 3:

BV/TV

MV/TV

Figure 4. Bone and marrow volume progress
over a number of iterations.
The variation of bone perimeter is shown in Figure 5.
The rapid reduction of perimeter around iterations 20-25
is explained by trabecular perforations, as can be seen in
the Appendix. This also results in a sudden increase in
roughness as shown in Figure 6.

Tb.Th was not used, as it presupposes a certain
morphology and similarity of metrics with his original

can be seen in the SAD.M plot after step number 22,
where trabecular perforations result in a rapid increase in
the overall size of marrow cavities. Additionally, the
standard deviation increases, further reflecting the
presence of large and small marrow cavities. In contrast
mean SAD.B remains fairly constant, but its standard
deviation increases, indicating the presence of more
straight and probably thicker trabeculae.

the stiffness of the structure momentarily increases and

can be clearly seen.

5. Discussion
The purpose of this work was to define a set of
algorithms that would allow the direct derivation of most
commonly used morphological indices of cancellous bone.
More importantly, the algorithms can compute metrics
directly from 3D, offering a more accurate picture than
current approaches where some metrics are calculated on
a per voxel-plane basis (being effectively 2D). These
algorithms have been incorporated into our simulations
and are able to perform histomorphometric analyses on

binary pixel and voxel maps without any user
intervention.
During the course of the simulation, density
momentarily increases for the first few iterations,
responding to the sudden loading scheme after the
structure’s initial equilibrated state. Afterwards there is an
almost linear and gradual reduction in bone mass. Both
perimeter and roughness respond the same way at the
beginning of the simulations, with a small sudden
increase. Perimeter gradually decreases, at a lower rate
than density, justifying the increase in surface roughness.
Trabecular thickness exhibits a slightly increasing trend
until the middle of the simulation and then shows a
decreasing trend, finally reaching a level slightly lower
than the original value at the start of the simulation. The
standard deviation also increases gradually during the
simulation, showing the presence of thinner and thicker
trabeculae, compared to the structure at the start of the
simulation. This is clearly visibly from the colour plots in
the Appendix, where the thickest trabecular are located at
the corners of the structure. As the simulations progress
trabecular separation increases, but not as fast as the
derived separation shows. The number of trabeculae
present also decreases, especially after the perforations
witnessed at iterations 20-25. The corresponding derived
index is constantly underestimated by a factor of two in
comparison to the directly computed one, being in exact
agreement with [7]. Star area/volume distribution is
known to be sensitive in trabecular perforations and this
evident after the sudden increase of that metric and its
standard deviation, after iteration 20.
The algorithms are quite processor demanding,
requiring 10-11 minutes at 1° intervals to calculate a full
set of metrics for each iteration on the example structure
above, on a Pentium II – 300 MHz class processor.
Clearly, for a full 3D structure with more elements, a
parallel version of the above algorithms will prove
essential. However, the above metrics can also be
calculated at coarser angular intervals (>1°), reducing the
computational requirements.

6. Conclusions
A set of algorithms has been developed that derive
indices to quantify the morphology of the structures
produced by our simulations. In addition, the simulations
can be indirectly validated by comparing the results with
the literature. The metrics are separated in three groups.
The first measures directly the trabecular thickness,
separation and number. The second measures the size of
marrow cavities and bone areas, whilst the last one
computes surface roughness.

The figures (on the left) show the structure of Figure 3 after simulation iterations 1, 9 and 22,
along with the corresponding radar plots (on the right) of the trabecular thickness over 360°°.
The trabecular alignment on the figures is evident and can also be seen on the radar plots.
