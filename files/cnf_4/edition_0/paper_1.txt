Abstract

Bio

The remarkable adoption of information visualization has
triggered worldwide application from researchers, companies, governments, and news media. The public interest in
visually rich infographics has raised questions of how best
to present insights and what interactive capabilities enable
engaging exploration, while maintaining comprehensibility. Government professionals find that compelling visual
presentations inform policy making. At the same time
researchers and corporate decision makers have increased
expectations of how visual analytics can support important
discoveries and business decisions. Our research community is racing to deal with complex data, rich questions, and
large-scale data streams. This talk will present some success
stories and suggest promising research directions.
