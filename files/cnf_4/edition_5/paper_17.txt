A BSTRACT
A straight-line grid drawing of a planar graph G is a drawing of G
on an integer grid such that each vertex is drawn as a grid point and
each edge is drawn as a straight-line segment without edge crossings. It is well known that a planar graph of n vertices admits a
straight-line grid drawing on a grid of area O(n2 ). A lower bound
of Ω(n2 ) on the area-requirement for straight-line grid drawings of
certain planar graphs is also known. In this paper, we introduce a
fairly large class of planar graphs which admits a straight-line grid
drawing on a grid of area O(n). We also give a linear-time algorithm
to find such a drawing. Our new class of planar graphs, which we
call “doughnut graphs,” is a subclass of 5-connected planar graphs.
We also show several interesting properties of “doughnut graphs”
in this paper.

1 I NTRODUCTION
Recently automatic aesthetic drawings of graphs have created intense interest due to their broad applications in computer networks,
VLSI layout, information visualization etc., and as a consequence
a number of drawing styles have come out [9]. The most typical
and widely studied drawing style is the “straight-line drawing” of
a planar graph. A straight-line drawing of a planar graph G is a
drawing of G such that each vertex is drawn as a point and each
edge is drawn as a straight-line segment without edge crossings.
A straight-line grid drawing of a planar graph G is a straight-line
drawing of G on an integer grid such that each vertex is drawn
as a grid point as shown in Fig. 1(b). Wagner [12], Fary [5] and
Stein [11] independently proved that every planar graph G has a
straight-line drawing. Their proofs immediately yield polynomialtime algorithms to find a straight-line drawing of a given plane
graph. However, the area of a rectangle enclosing a drawing on
an integer grid obtained by these algorithms is not bounded by any
polynomial in the number n of vertices in G. In fact, to obtain
a drawing of area bounded by a polynomial remained as an open
problem for long time. In 1990, de Fraysseix et al. [4] and Schnyder [10] showed by two different methods that every planar graph of
n ≥ 3 vertices has a straight-line drawing on an integer grid of size
(2n−4)×(n−2) and (n−2)×(n−2), respectively. Fig. 1(b) illustrates a straight-line grid drawing of the graph G in Fig. 1(a) with
area O(n2 ). A natural question arises: what is the minimum size
of a grid required for a straight-line drawing? de Fraysseix et al.
showed that, for each n ≥ 3, there exits a plane graph of n vertices,
for example nested triangles, which needs a grid size of at least

2(n−1)/3 × 2(n−1)/3 for any grid drawing [3, 4]. It has been
conjectured that every plane graph of n vertices has a grid drawing
on a 2n/3 × 2n/3 grid, but it is still an open problem. For some
restricted classes of graphs, more compact straight-line grid drawings are known. For example, a 4-connected plane graph G having
at least four vertices on the outer face has a straight-line grid drawing with area ( n/2 − 1) × ( n/2 ) [8]. Garg and Rusu showed
that an n-node binary tree has a planar straight-line grid drawing
with area O(n) [7]. Although trees admit straight-line grid drawings with linear area, it is generally thought that triangulations may
require a grid of quadratic size. Hence finding nontrivial classes
of planar graphs of n vertices richer than trees that admit straightline grid drawings with area o(n2 ) is posted as an open problem in
[2]. Garg and Rusu showed that an outerplanar graph with n vertices and the maximum degree d has a planar straight-line drawing
with area O(dn1.48 ) [6]. Recently Di Battista and Frati showed
that a “balanced” outerplanar graph of n vertices has a straight-line
grid drawing with area O(n) and a general outerplanar graph of n
vertices has a straight-line grid drawing with area O(n1.48 ) [1].
In this paper, we introduce a new class of planar graphs which
has a straight-line grid drawing on a grid of area O(n). We also
give a linear-time algorithm to find such a drawing. Our new class
of planar graphs is a subclass of 5-connected planar graphs, and we
call the class “doughnut graphs” since a graph in this class has a
doughnut-like embedding as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). In an embedding of a doughnut graph of n vertices there are two vertex-disjoint
faces each having exactly n/4 vertices and each of all the other faces

has exactly three vertices. Fig. 1(a) illustrates a doughnut graph of
16 vertices where each of the two faces F1 and F2 contains four
vertices and each of all other faces contains exactly three vertices.
Fig. 1(c) illustrates a doughnut-like embedding of G where F1 is
embedded as the outer face and F2 is embedded as an inner face.
A straight-line grid drawing of G with area O(n) is illustrated in
Fig. 1(d). We also show several interesting properties of doughnut
graphs in this paper.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, we give some definitions. Section 3 provides some properties of
the class of “doughnut graphs.” Section 4 deals with straight-line
grid drawings of “doughnut graphs.” Finally Section 5 concludes
the paper.
2 P RELIMINARIES
In this section we give some definitions.
Let G = (V, E) be a connected simple graph with vertex set V and
edge set E. Throughout the paper, we denote by n the number of
vertices in G, that is, n = |V |, and denote by m the number of edges
in G, that is, m=|E|. An edge joining vertices u and v is denoted by
(u, v). The degree of a vertex v, denoted by d(v), is the number of
edges incident to v in G. G is called r-regular if every vertex of G
has degree r. We call a vertex v a neighbor of a vertex u in G if G has
an edge (u, v). The connectivity κ (G) of a graph G is the minimum
number of vertices whose removal results in a disconnected graph
or a single-vertex graph K1 . G is called k-connected if κ (G) ≥ k.
A graph is planar if it can be embedded in the plane so that
no two edges intersect geometrically except at a vertex to which
they are both incident. A plane graph is a planar graph with a
fixed embedding. A plane graph G divides the plane into connected
regions called f aces. The unbounded region is called the outer
face. For a face F in G we denote by V (F) the set of vertices of G
on the boundary of face F. We call two faces F1 and F2 are vertex/ Let F be a face in a plane graph G
disjoint if V (F1 ) V (F2 ) = 0.
with n ≥ 3. If the boundary of F has exactly three edges then we
call F a triangulated face. One can divide a face F of p (p ≥ 3)
vertices into p − 2 triangulated faces by adding p − 3 extra edges.
The operation above is called triangulating a face. If every face of
a graph is triangulated, then the graph is called a triangulated plane
graph.
A maximal planar graph is one to which no edge can be added
without losing planarity. Thus in any embedding of a maximal planar graph G with n ≥ 3, the boundary of every face of G is a triangle,
and hence an embedding of a maximal planar graph is often called
a triangulated plane graph. It can be derived from the Euler’s formula for planar graphs that if G is a maximal planar graph with n
vertices and m edges then m = 3n - 6, for more details see [9]. A
spanning subgraph of G is a subgraph with vertex set V (G).
Let G be a 5-connected planar graph, let Γ be any planar embedding of G and let p be an integer such that p ≥ 3. We call G a
p-doughnut graph if the following Conditions (d1 ) and (d2 ) hold:
(d1 ) Γ has two vertex-disjoint faces each of which has exactly p
vertices, and all the other faces of Γ has exactly three vertices; and
(d2 ) G has the minimum number of vertices satisfying Condition
(d1 ).
In general, we call a p-doughnut graph for p ≥ 3 a doughnut
graph. Since a doughnut graph is 5-connected, the following fact
holds.
Fact 2.1 Let G be a doughnut graph and let Γ and Γ be any two
plane embeddings of G. Then any facial cycle of Γ is a facial cycle
of Γ .
Fact 2.1 implies that decomposition of a doughnut graph into its
facial cycles is unique. Throughout the paper we often mention
faces of a doughnut graph G without mentioning its plane embedding where description of the faces are valid for any plane embedding of G.

3 P ROPERTIES OF D OUGHNUT G RAPHS
In this section we will show some properties of a p-doughnut graph.
We have the following lemma on the number of vertices of a graph
satisfying Condition (d1 ).
Lemma 3.1 Let G be a 5-connected planar graph, let Γ be any
planar embedding of G, and let p be an integer such that p ≥ 3. Assume that Γ has two vertex-disjoint faces each of which has exactly
p vertices, and all the other faces of Γ has exactly three vertices.
Then G has at least 4p vertices.
Proof. Let F1 and F2 be the two faces of Γ each of which contains
exactly p vertices. Let x be the number of vertices in G which are
neither on F1 nor on F2 . Then G has x + 2p vertices.
We now calculate the number of edges in graph G. Faces F1 and
F2 may not be triangulated, but all other faces of Γ are triangulated.
If we triangulate both the faces F1 and F2 of Γ then the resulting
graph G is a maximal planar graph. Using Euler formula for planar
graphs, one can find that G has exactly 3(x + 2p) − 6 = 3x + 6p − 6
edges. To triangulate each of F1 and F2 , we need to add p − 3 edges
and hence the number of edges in G is exactly
(3x + 6p − 6) − 2(p − 3)

=

3x + 4p

(1)

Since G is 5-connected, degree of a vertex of G is at least 5.
Hence, from the degree-sum formula we get 2(3x + 4p) ≥ 5(x +
2p). This relation implies
x

≥

Therefore G has at least 4p vertices.

Q.E .D.

Lemma 3.1 implies that a p-doughnut graph has 4p or more vertices. We now show that 4p vertices are sufficient to construct a
p-doughnut graph as in the following lemma.
Lemma 3.2 For an integer p, (p ≥ 3), one can construct a pdoughnut graph G with 4p vertices.
Proof.
We first construct a planar embedding Γ of G with 4p
vertices and then show that G is a p-doughnut graph.
Construction. Let C1 ,C2 ,C3 be three cycles such that C1 contains p vertices, C2 contains 2p vertices and C3 contains p vertices.
Let x1 , x2 , ..., x p be the vertices on C1 , y1 , y2 , ..., y p be the vertices
on C3 , and z1 , z2 , .., z2p be the vertices on C2 . Let R1 , R2 and R3
be three concentric circles on a plane with radius r1 , r2 and r3 , respectively, such that r1 > r2 > r3 . We embed C1 , C2 and C3 on R1 ,
R2 and R3 respectively, as follows. We put the vertices x1 , x2 ...x p
of C1 on R1 in clockwise order such that x1 is put on the leftmost
position among the vertices x1 , x2 , ..., x p . Similarly, we put vertices
z1 , z2 , ..., z2p of C2 on R2 and y1 , y2 , ..., y p of C3 on R3 . We now add
edges between the vertices on C1 and C2 , and between the vertices
on C2 and C3 . We have two cases to consider.
Case 1: k is even in zk .
In this case, we add two edges (zk , xk/2 ), (zk , xi ) between C2 and
C1 , and one edge (zk , yi ) between C2 and C3 where i = 1 if k = 2p,
i = k/2 + 1 otherwise.
Case 2: k is odd in zk .
In this case we add two edges (zk , y k/2 ), (zk , yi ) between C2
and C3 , and one edge (zk , x k/2 ) between C1 and C2 where i = 1 if
k = 2p − 1, i = k/2 + 1 otherwise.
We thus constructed a planar embedding Γ of G. Fig. 2 illustrates
the construction above for the case of p = 4.
We now prove that G is a p-doughnut graph. To prove this claim
we can prove that G satisfies the following properties (a)–(c): (a)
the graph G is a 5-connected planar graph; (b) any planar embedding Γ of G has exactly two vertex-disjoint faces each of which has

G has the minimum number of vertices satisfying (a) and (b). The
details of the proof are omitted in this extended abstract.
Q.E .D.
Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 imply that a p-doughnut graph G has exactly 4p vertices. Then the value of x in Eq. (2) is 2p in G. By
Eq. (1), G has exactly 3x + 4p = 10p edges. Since G is 5-connected,
every vertex has degree 5 or more. Then degree-sum formula implies that every vertex of G has degree exactly 5, since G has 4p
vertices and 10p edges. Therefore the following theorem holds
Theorem 3.3 Let G be a p-doughnut graph. Then G is 5-regular
and has exactly 4p vertices.
For a cycle C in a plane graph G, we denote by G(C) the plane
subgraph of G inside C excluding C. Let C1 , C2 and C3 be three
vertex-disjoint cycles in G such that V (C1 ) ∪V (C2 ) ∪V (C3 )=V (G).
Then we call an embedding Γ of G a doughnut embedding of G if
C1 is the outer face of Γ, G(C1 ) contains C2 and G(C2 ) contains
C3 . We call C1 the outer cycle, C2 the middle cycle and C3 the
inner cycle of Γ. We next show that a p-doughnut graph has a
doughnut embedding. To prove the claim we need the following
lemma whose proof is omitted in this extended abstract.
Lemma 3.4 Let G be a p-doughnut graph. Let F1 and F2 be the
two faces of G each of which contains exactly p vertices. Then
G − {V (F1 ) ∪V (F2 )} is connected and contains a cycle.
We now prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.5 A p-doughnut graph always has a doughnut embedding.
Proof. Let F1 and F2 be two faces of G each of which contains
exactly p vertices. Let Γ be a plane embedding of G such that F1 is
embedded as the outer face. By Lemma 3.4 G − {V (F1 ) ∪V (F2 )} is
connected and contains a cycle. Let C be a cycle in G − {V (F1 ) ∪
V (F2 )}. One can observe that if G(C ) does not contain F2 , then
there would be edge crossings among the edges from the vertices
on C to the vertices on F1 and F2 , and hence Γ would not be a plane
embedding of G. Therefore G(C ) contains F2 . Furthermore, G −
{V (F1 ) ∪V (F2 )} contains exactly one cycle C , and C contains all
vertices of G−{V (F1 )∪V (F2 )}; otherwise, Γ would not be a planar
embedding of G, a contradiction. Therefore in Γ, G(F1 ) contains C
and G(C ) contains F2 and hence Γ is a doughnut embedding.
Q.E .D.
A 1-outerplanar graph is an embedded planar graph where all
vertices are on the outer face. It is also called 1-outerplane graph.
An embedded graph is a k-outerplanar (k > 1) if the embedded
graph obtained by removing all vertices of the outer face is a

(k − 1)-outerplane graph. A graph is k-outerplanar if it admits a
k-outerplanar embedding. A planar graph G has outerplanarity k (
k > 0) if it is k-outerplanar and it is not j-outerplanar for 0 < j < k.
We can prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.6 The outerplanarity of a p-doughnut graph G is 3.

S TRAIGHT-L INE G RID D RAWINGS OF D OUGHNUT
G RAPHS
In this section we give a linear-time algorithm for finding a straightline grid drawing of a doughnut graph on a grid of linear area.
Let G be a p-doughnut graph. By Theorem 3.5 G has a doughnut
embedding. Let Γ be a doughnut embedding of G as illustrated in
Fig. 3(a). Let C1 , C2 , and C3 be the outer cycle, the middle cycle
and the inner cycle of Γ, respectively. We now have the following
lemmas.
Lemma 4.1 Let G be a p-doughnut graph and let Γ be a doughnut
embedding of G. Let C1 , C2 , and C3 be the outer cycle, the middle
cycle and the inner cycle of Γ, respectively. For any two consecutive
vertices zi , zi+1 on C2 , one of zi , zi+1 has exactly one neighbor on
C1 and the other has exactly two neighbors on C1 .
Lemma 4.2 Let G be a p-doughnut graph and let Γ be a doughnut
embedding of G. Let C1 , C2 and C3 be the outer cycle, the middle
cycle and the inner cycle of Γ, respectively. Let zi be a vertex on
C2 , then either the following (a) or (b) holds. (a) zi has exactly one
neighbor on C1 and exactly two neighbors on C3 . (b) zi has exactly
one neighbor on C3 and exactly two neighbors on C1 .
Before describing our algorithm we need some definitions. Let
zi be a vertex on C2 such that zi has two neighbors on C1 . Let x
and x be the two neighbors of zi on C1 such that x is the counter
clockwise next vertex to x on C1 . We call x the left neighbor of zi
on C1 and x the right neighbor of zi on C1 . Similarly we define the
left neighbor and the right neighbor of zi on C3 if a vertex zi on C2
has two neighbors on C3 . We are now ready to give our algorithm.
We now embed C1 , C2 and C3 on three nested rectangles R1 , R2
and R3 , respectively on a grid as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). We draw
rectangle R1 on grid with four corners on grid point (0, 0), (p + 1,
0), (p + 1, 5) and (0, 5). Similarly the four corners of R2 are (1, 1),
(p, 1), (p, 4), (1, 4) and the four corners of R3 are (2, 2), (p − 1, 2),
(p − 1, 3), (2, 3).
We first embed C2 on R2 as follows. Let z1 , z2 , ..., z2p be the
vertices on C2 in counter clockwise order such that z1 has exactly
one neighbor in C1 . We put z1 on (1, 1), z p on (p, 1), z p+1 on (p, 4)
and z2p on (1, 4). We put the other vertices of C2 on grid points of
R2 preserving the relative positions of vertices of C2 .
We now put vertices of C1 on R1 as follows. Let x1 be the neighbor of z1 on C1 and let x1 , x2 , ..., x p be the vertices of C1 in counter
clockwise order. We put x1 on (0, 0) and x p on (0, 5). Since z1
has exactly one neighbor on C1 , by Lemma 4.1, z2p has exactly two
neighbors on C1 since z2p and z1 are consecutive vertices on C2 .
Since z1 and z2p is on a triangulated face of G having vertices on
both C1 and C2 , x1 is a neighbor of z2p . One can easily observe that
x p is the other neighbor of z2p on C1 . Clearly the edges (x1 , z1 ),
(x1 , z2p ), (x p , z2p ) can be drawn as straight-line segment without
edge crossing as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). We next put neighbors of
z p and z p+1 . Let xi be the neighbor of z p on C1 if z p has exactly
one neighbor on C1 , otherwise let xi be the left neighbor of z p on
C1 . We put xi on (p + 1, 0) and xi+1 on (p + 1, 5). We now show
that the edges from z p and z p+1 to xi and xi+1 can be drawn as
straight-line segments without edge crossings. We first consider the
case where z p has exactly one neighbor on C1 . In this case xi is the
only one neighbor of z p on C1 . Then, by Lemma 4.1, z p+1 has two
neighbors on C1 . Since each face having vertices on both C1 and
C2 is triangulated, xi and xi+1 are the two neighbors of z p+1 on C1 .

edge crossings. Fig. 3(e) illustrates the complete straight-line grid
drawing of a p-doughnut graph.
The area requirement of the straight-line grid drawing of a pdoughnut graph G is equal to the area of rectangle R1 and the area
of R1 is = (p + 1) × 6 = (n/4 + 1) × 6 = O(n), where n is the number
of vertices in G. Thus we have a straight-line grid drawing of a pdoughnut graph on a grid of linear area. Clearly the algorithm takes
linear time. Thus the following theorem holds.

(b) edges between four corner vertices of R1 and R2 are drawn as
straight-line segments, (c) edges between vertices on R1 and R2 are
drawn, (d) edges between four corner vertices of R2 and R3 are drawn
as straight-line segments, and (e) a straight-line grid drawing of G.

Clearly the edges (z p , xi ), (z p+1 , xi ) and (z p+1 , xi+1 ) can be drawn
as straight-line segments without edge crossings, as illustrated in
Fig. 3(b). We next consider the case where z p has two neighbors
on C1 . In this case let xi and xi+1 be the two neighbors of z p on
C1 . By Lemma 4.1, z p+1 has exactly one neighbor on C1 . Since the
face of G containing z p , z p+1 and the neighbor of z p+1 on C1 is triangulated, xi+1 is the neighbor of z p+1 . Clearly the edges (z p , xi ),
(z p , xi+1 ) and (z p+1 , xi+1 ) can be drawn as straight-line segments
without edge crossings. We put the other vertices of C1 on grid
points of R1 arbitrarily preserving their relative positions on C1 .
One can observe that all edges of G connecting vertices in {z2 ,
z3 , ..., z p−1 } to vertices in {x2 , x3 , .., xi−1 } can be drawn as straightline segments without edge crossings. Similarly, the edges of G
connecting vertices in {z p+1 , z p+2 , ..., z2p−1 } to vertices in {xi+2 ,
xi+3 , .., x p−1 } can be drawn as straight-line segments without edge
crossings. See Fig. 3(c).
We now put the vertices of C3 on R3 as follows. Since z1 has exactly one neighbor on C1 , by Lemma 4.2(a), z1 has exactly two
neighbors on C3 . Then, by Lemma 4.2(b), z2p has exactly one
neighbor on C3 since z2p has exactly two neighbors on C1 . Let
y1 , y2 , ..., y p be the vertices on C3 in counter clockwise order such
that y1 is the right neighbor of z1 . Then y p is the left neighbor of
z1 . We put y1 on (2, 2) and y p on (2, 3). Clearly the edges (y1 , z1 ),
(y1 , z2p ), (y p , z1 ) can be drawn as straight-line segements without
edge crossings, as illustrated in Fig. 3(d). We next put neighbors
of z p and z p+1 on C3 . Let yi be the neighbor of z p on C2 if z p has
exactly one neighbor on C3 , otherwise yi be the left neighbor and
yi+1 be the right neighbor of z p on C3 . We put yi on (p − 1, 2)
and yi+1 on (p − 1, 3), and hence the edges of G from z p and z p+1
to yi and yi+1 can be drawn as straight-line segments without edge
crossing as illustrated in Fig. 3(d). We put the other vertices of C3
on grid points of R3 arbitrarily preserving their relative positions on
C3 . It is not difficult to show that edges from the vertices on C2 to
the vertices on C3 can be drawn as straight-line segments without

Theorem 4.3 A doughnut graph G of n vertices has a straight-line
grid drawing on a grid of area O(n). Furthermore, the drawing of
G can be found in linear time.
5 C ONCLUSION
In this paper we introduced a new class of planar graphs, called
doughnut graphs, which is a subclass of 5-connected planar graphs.
A graph in this class has a straight-line grid drawing on a grid of
linear area, and the drawing can be found in linear time. We also
showed that a doughnut graph is a 5-regular graph and the outerplanarity of a doughnut graph is 3. Although the class doughnut graphs
contains exactly one graph for each integer p ≥ 3, the class contains an infinite number of graphs. Since a doughnut graph G has a
straight-line grid drawing on a grid of linear area, any spanning subgraph of G has a straight-line grid drawing on a grid of linear area.
Thus doughnut graphs and their spanning subgraphs constitute a
wide class of graphs which admits a straight-line grid drawing on
a grid of linear area. Our linear algorithm finds a straight-line grid
drawing of a doughnut graph. If we can augment a spanning subgraph G of a doughnut graph G to the doughnut graph G, then our
algorithm can be used to find a straight-line grid drawing of G on
a grid of linear area. However recognizing a spanning subgraph of
a doughnut graph and its augmentation look a non-trivial problem
and it is left as an open problem. Finding other nontrivial classes of
planar graphs which admit straight-line grid drawings on grids of
linear area is also left as an open problem.
