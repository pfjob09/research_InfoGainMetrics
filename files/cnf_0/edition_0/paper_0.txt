ABSTRACT
The NameVoyager, a web-based visualization of historical
trends in baby naming, has proven remarkably popular. This paper
discusses the interaction techniques it uses for smooth visual
exploration of thousands of time series. We also describe design
decisions behind the application and lessons learned in creating an
application that makes do-it-yourself data mining popular. The
prime lesson, it is hypothesized, is that an information
visualization tool may be fruitfully viewed not as a tool but as part
of an online social environment. In other words, to design a
successful exploratory data analysis tool, one good strategy is to
create a system that enables “social” data analysis.

In hundreds of spontaneous comments, users are seen to be
engaged in extended exploratory data analysis, identifying trends
and anomalies and forming conjectures. These self-reports also
lead to an observation about the NameVoyager: usage patterns are
strongly social, and seem more closely related to those of online
multiplayer games than to a conventional single-user statistical
tool. Indeed, users seem to fall neatly into Richard Bartle’s wellknown categorization of online game players [4] as explorers,
achievers, socializers, or killers. This stands in contrast to the
traditional view of information visualization as a task-oriented
problem-solving activity. We hypothesize that the broad
popularity of the NameVoyager stems from features that not only
give it a game-like sense of fun, but that make it especially
suitable for “social” data analysis. We then suggest some general
properties which may encourage this type of usage of
visualizations.

INTRODUCTION

In February of 2005, my wife published her first book, a guide
to American baby names called The Baby Name Wizard [14]
which used a data-analysis approach to understanding name
styles. To help call attention to the book, I created a web-based
visualization applet, the NameVoyager [8], which lets users
interactively explore name dataȯspecifically, historical name
popularity figures. The gambit succeeded and without any
advertising the applet drew more than 500,000 site visits in the
first two weeks after launch. Two months afterwards it is
maintaining an average of 10,000 visits a day. Perhaps more
important is that evidence suggests many people are engaging
deeply with the visualization, spending considerable time and
discovering for themselves facts and insights about name trends.
The broad popularity and effectiveness of the NameVoyager is
especially interesting because it is, in essence, an exploratory data
analysis application for a data set of 6,000 time series. In many
situations, ranging from education to retirement planning, it is
important to encourage users to interact with complex data sets.
Understanding the factors that led a statistical exploration
program to become a minor fad may shed light on the broader
problem of encouraging users to engage in their own personal data
mining expeditions.
An important piece of the puzzle is the public nature of a webbased application. As of April 2005, Google finds more than
11,000 references to the NameVoyager, many of which turn out to
be lengthy sequences of comments on blogs and discussion sites.
These comments provide clues as to how and why users are
spending time with the applet. This data is in no way a scientific
survey, but it does represent a large body of field usage
information in which patterns emerge.

Data
The NameVoyager is based on a data set, derived from public
Social Security Administration (SSA) information that tracks
baby name trends in the United States. For each decade since
1900 the SSA publishes lists of the most popular 1,000 boys and
girls names, along with the exact number of babies given these
names. These lists were downloaded, collated, cleaned, and
normalized by the author of the Baby Name Wizard book to
produce a data set containing popularity time series for roughly
6,000 distinct names.
These time series turn out to be meaningful in many ways. A
graph of the popularity of a given name reveals a great deal about
its overall cultural connotations and “feel,” and names whose
popularity is correlated over time tend to seem similar. (For more
information, see The Baby Name Wizard.)

Visualization method

The method used to visualize the data is straightforward: given a
set of name popularity time series, a set of stacked graphs is
produced, as in Figure 1. Such stacked graphs are common in
print information design and have recently been used in several
information visualization projects such as ThemeRiver [5] and
Artifacts of the Presence Era [13]. The x-axis corresponds to date,
and the y-axis to total frequency for all names currently in view,
in terms of occurrences per million babies. Each stripe represents
a name, and the thickness of a stripe is proportional to its
frequency of use at the given time step.
In keeping with contemporary American custom, the stripes are
colored pink for girls and blue for boys. The brightness of each
stripe varies according to the most recent popularity data, so that
currently popular names are darkest and stand out the most. The
idea behind this color scheme is twofold. First, names that are
currently popular are more likely to be of interest to viewers—
many people will probably want to know statistics on Jennifer, but
few are looking for Cloyd. Second, the fact that the brightness
varies provides a way to distinguish neighboring name stripes
without relying on visually heavy borders.
2.3

Interaction

The NameVoyager follows Shneiderman’s mantra of “overview
first, zoom and filter, details on demand” [10]. When the applet
starts, the viewer sees a set of stripes representing all names in the
database. Filtering this data is achieved via an extremely simple
mechanism. A user may type in letters, forming a prefix; the
applet will then visualize data on only those names beginning with
that prefix.
The applet reacts directly with each keystroke, so it is not
necessary for the user to press return or to click a submit button.
Not only does this instant interaction save the user some work, but
it helps demonstrate how to mine the data. A user might not think
that searching the data set by prefix would be interesting, but
seeing the striking patterns for single letters like O or K could
encourage further exploration. In addition, the applet moves
smoothly between states, so that when a letter is typed, an
animated transition helps preserve context.
Figure 1 shows an example: typing “JO” will yield a graph with
prominent stripes for popular names such as John, Jonathan,
Joseph, and Joyce, along with many thinner stripes for less
popular names like Josette. Because the initial letters of a name
contribute strongly to its sound, names that start with the same
letters often have similar graph patterns. As a result, the simple
mechanism of filtering by prefix is effective in highlighting
interesting name trends. Typing “O” produces the graph in Figure
2, with an easily identifiable pattern of popularity of O names at
the beginning and end of the 1900s, but a significant dip midcentury. Typing “LAT” highlights a trend in the AfricanAmerican community in the 1970s, comprising names such as
LaToya, LaTanya, LaTisha, and so on, as in Figure 3. Name
stripes are ordered alphabetically on the screen from top to bottom
to aid in identifying such prefix-based cultural clusters.

Figure 2. Names beginning with O

To learn details of a name, a viewer can use the mouse.
Hovering over a name stripe will produce a pop-up box with
numerical details for a given name at a given point in time.
Clicking on a name stripe produces a graph of the popularity of
that name alone.
This interaction technique may be compared to dynamic query
systems such as starfield displays [2] or TimeSearcher [6]. The
keyboard interaction may be viewed as an alternative to the
Alphaslider of [1]. A key distinction between the graphical
display of the NameVoyager and the visualization used in
TimeSearcher, is the NameVoyager’s use of a graph that sums all
the time series. This technique seems likely to be of use in many
other situations where summing is a natural operation, such as
investigating product sales data.

Figure 3. Names Beginning with LAT

2.4

The NameVoyager is a Java applet, written using JDK 1.1 so
that it may run in a wide variety of browsers. All the name data (a
60K zip file) is loaded at startup and parsed into Java objects, so
that it may be accessed rapidly.
To make the animated transitions run smoothly, not all 6,000
stripes are drawn; instead, a simple level-of-detail calculation is
performed so that only stripes wider than 2 pixels are rendered to
the screen. As a result, in practice the applet only draws about 200
or fewer stripes per frame. In an initial version of the applet, this
culling of names caused prominent and irritating white stripes in
the graph, where the white background would “show through” the
undrawn stripes. Replacing the white background with a neutral
gray, halfway between the blue and pink tones of the name
stripes, was a simple and effective remedy: the background was
still visible but barely noticeable.

RESULTS

“I happened upon it at work today and it affected the
productivity of our entire department.”

3.1
Traffic and Web Comments
As mentioned in the introduction, the NameVoyager received a
remarkable number of visits within weeks of launch. The applet
has been downloaded more than 900,000 times as of mid-April. It
has also been extensively discussed on the web, in blogs,
discussion forums, and similar sites.
This intense level of conversation is further evidence that users
were engaging deeply with the applet and of its widespread
popularity. It is not uncommon to find discussions in the
comments section of a blog that contain dozens of posts. Such
long discussions occur even when it is not related to the topic of
the web site—for instance, one of the most extensive sets of
comments was found on a forum in a well-known libertarian
magazine site.
The comments also provide an unusual and informative window
into the user experience, and we quote them extensively below.
Comments that have been posted to the web are clearly not a
scientific sample, since only the most enthusiastic users will
comment. Nonetheless, examining these comments suggests some
interesting hypotheses regarding the source of popularity of the
NameVoyager.
3.2

The Target Audience and the Surprise Factor

As one might expect, there are many positive comments from
people in the target audience for the visualization—users who
have a strong interest in names and therefore might be interested
in buying the book. Two examples (all quotes in this paper are
taken from public web sites) illustrate this:
“This is perfect, as baby names weigh heavily on my mind these
days.”
“Useful fodder for historical fiction, too, if you’re looking for
typical names for a given age and time period.”

A surprising observation is that many people outside the target
audience found themselves enjoying the applet. The surprise here
is not the author’s, but of the users themselves. Some sample
quotes:
“Surprisingly addictive”
“This rules, even though it’s about baby names”
“Cool… by the way, I don’t like babies or children.”
This “surprise factor” is a reason for optimism. It is common to
want users to explore a set of data that they may have little
inherent interest in. A good example is the amount of effort and
money that American companies spend to encourage their
employees to understand 401(k) plans. It is therefore worthwhile
to look for clues to what made the NameVoyager appeal to people
who profess boredom with the topic of baby names.

SOCIAL DATA ANALYSIS

One of the most consistent themes seen in comments about the
NameVoyager is that exploring the data has become a social
activity. Many people mention group usage, for instance:

Of special interest, however, is that when a group of people
uses the applet, they often do so in a social, collaborative fashion,
engaging in a dialogue as they mine the data. This is true even for
loosely knit groups of web users. For example, here are some
quotes from the comments section of one blog:
“For a challenge, try finding a name that was popular at the
beginning of the sample (around 1900), went out of style, then
came back into vogue recently”
Another person responds, “Take a look at Grace, #18 in the
1900s, #13 in 2003, and down in the 200s and 300s during midcentury”.
A third writes,
“1900’s comeback: Porter. Another one, with a mini-peak in
trough: Caroline,” and then adds,
“More challenges: which is the steadiest popular name?
Victor?” and “Which letter has gone down most consistently? W?
Observation: Note the recent upsurge in Y; basically all due to
Hispanic (and some Middle Eastern) names”
The original poster responds, “You’re right, W has gone most
consistently down, although F is pretty close (if it weren’t for
Faith…)”
These quotes, which are just a small part of the full exchange,
illustrate two points. First, they show how a group of people is
using the NameVoyager as a stimulus to conversation and
repartee.
They also reveal an effective style of data analysis: this group
of people is diving very deeply into the data set! They are setting
each other pattern-finding challenges, noting outlying data points,
and making guesses about causal relations. Each person seems to
be building on the findings of the others, making the group as a
whole extremely effective at mining the data—and having fun at
the same time. Strange or surprising pieces of information serve
as a kind of trophy for the finder. We refer to this process of data
mining through dialogue, one-upmanship, and repartee as social
data analysis. It is a version of exploratory data analysis that relies
on social interaction as source of inspiration and motivation.
We hypothesize that viewing exploratory data analysis as a
social activity may explain much of the reaction to the
NameVoyager. Its popularity among people who do not find the
data intrinsically interesting, for instance, could partly be due to
the fact that these users are enjoying the social activity
surrounding the applet. In the next sections, to understand better
the social structure of this type of exploratory data analysis, we
consider the different roles that users may play.
4.1

As in any social system, it seems that people using the
NameVoyager have a wide range of styles of interaction with each
other. Comments on the web suggest that there are four distinct
types of users. Interestingly, these types seem to align closely with
a taxonomy developed by Richard Bartle [4] in the context of an
early class of online social environment called a MUD.

Roles in Social Data Analysis

3

Bartle suggested that denizens of such online multiplayer
environments typically fall into one of four types: achievers,
socializers, explorers, and killers. Below we describe how each of
these roles seems to correspond to a particular type of
NameVoyager user. While this is only a preliminary
classification, it may be of use to designers in thinking about how
people use data visualization in social contexts, and also provides
additional evidence that use of the NameVoyager takes place in a
complex social environment.

known pundit used the NameVoyager to comment on the
changing statistical distribution of names over the past century
These users were certainly not using the NameVoyager to name
children, but rather were mining for nuggets of information that
they could show to others as trophies of their expedition. They are
directly analogous to Bartle’s Explorers, people who want to learn
as much as possible about the environment and who delight in
discovering odd or unexpected features.
4.5

4.2
Achievers
The context of the NameVoyager is a site designed to help
expectant parents name their babies, so the stated “goal” of the
applet is to find a good name. As described in Section 3.3, many
people do exactly that:

Killers

"We want something slightly retro, nice, and not too popular,
and this visualization gives us all that."

The last type in Bartle’s taxonomy is the Killer, someone who
enjoys imposing themselves on others and causing distress. One
might think that there would be no Killers in the gentle world of
baby names, but one would be wrong. A common theme is that
certain users take pleasure in singling out names for ridicule. For
these people the NameVoyager is a delightful source of fresh
targets:

Such users correspond to the Achievers in Bartle’s
classification: people who try to “achieve within the game’s
context.”

“It is also damn entertaining to me (and the real reason why I
am writing this) that I can type in Lexus and find that people
actually name their kids Lexus.”

4.3
Socializers
A second class of NameVoyager users consists of people whose
main concern is their interactions with others, and who place their
data exploration in a personal social context. These people,
corresponding to Bartle’s “Socializers,” use screenshots and data
from the applet as a catalyst for conversation and storytelling
about themselves and their friends and family. A common sight
on a blog is a person posting a screenshot of the graph of their
own name’s popularity, or a friend’s, with humorous comments.
A typical quote of this type is:

(Lest there be any doubt about the pugilistic nature of the
quote’s author, note that it was found on a site called
www.youandwhosearmy.com.)

“Runes name doesnt show up at all… but my name has
suddenly gotten popular … I HAD IT FIRST! heh”
Often people talk about family members as they speculate about
names, and see the changing popularity numbers as a kind of
personal plotline:
"my grandmother was named Coral and from what I can tell the
name appeared out of nowhere in 1880…is it from a celebrity or
something?"
“I got: ‘No names starting with LINUS were in the top 1,000
names in any decade.’ Translation: Your son's name will NEVER
be cool."

“Britney, Brittney, Britany, Brittany, Brittani, Britannie, Britni.
Enough already.”
DESIGN HYPOTHESES FOR SOCIAL DATA ANALYSIS

5

The evidence above suggests that a large part of the power and
popularity of the NameVoyager derives from the fact that it
encourages a social style of data analysis. What leads users to
approach data analysis as a social activity? Certain factors are
obvious. The NameVoyager is easily accessible on the web so that
a large group of people can see it. The interaction design, referred
to on the web with such terms as “cool,” “fantastic,” and
“whizzy,” means that applet is something that people may be
eager to associate themselves with, like a fashionable piece of
clothing.
These factors, however, would apply to anything trendy on the
web, whether a funny Flash animation or witty personality quiz.
Are there any aspects of the NameVoyager’s popularity that are
specific to information visualization? We present three hypotheses
below.
5.1

Common Ground But Unique Perspective

"Woo! Emily (being me) was number 1 in 2003! go me!"
Such relationship-oriented and storytelling behavior in the
context of information visualization has been observed before in
depictions of email archives [12].
4.4
Explorers
Many users of the NameVoyager seemed to delight in
unearthing odd names or unusual clusters. One person posted a
screenshot created after typing “ETH”: it showed the name Ethel
being gradually and completely eclipsed by the trendy name
Ethan. Another found the dramatic cluster of names starting with
“LAT” (Latisha, Latoya, etc.) described in section 2.3. A well-

The first hypothesis is that a combination of common ground
with unique individual perspectives will encourage social data
analysis.
In the case of the NameVoyager, the common ground is shared
understanding of cultural connotations of names. Although people
may differ in their tastes, most Americans would agree on the
likely ethnicity of a Rodrigo or a LaTanya, or the likely age of an
Ethel versus a Heather. Similarly, many names relate to
celebrities, pop culture icons, or historical figures.
This common ground is what makes conversation about the
data possible and interesting. Some sample quotes:
“Look what the Simpsons did to the name Bart.”

IEEE

"Roosevelt has two spikes right about where you'd expect
them."
“I love the fact that Xander and Willow show up on the list in
the 90s, thereby confirming the existence of Buffy fans as
hardcore as me.”
The authors of these comments are sharing results of their data
mining because they know that their readers will understand the
cultural references. The fact that the data is presented as a timeline
over a standard period, 1900 to present, also provides a common
context on which users overlay personal and cultural knowledge.
At the same time, we hypothesize that it is helpful for each
person to have a naturally unique perspective on the data. This
individual viewpoint can serve as a kind of icebreaker in the
conversation. It also means that, because each person is
approaching the data in a different way, a group may collectively
explore more pieces of the data. Evidence for this hypothesis
comes from [7], which described a system that encouraged
community participation by highlighting unique pieces of
knowledge that an individual might have. A well-respected
educational method known as the Jigsaw Classroom [3] uses a
similar technique.
In the case of the NameVoyager, each person has one obvious
point of entry: their own name. Names of relatives and close
friends are also common conversation starters. Some sample
comments illustrate this:
“I was appalled to note that my name is now in the top 100,
while it was about 700th when I was born…”
“My given name peaked in 1900 (or earlier) and has been on
the slide ever since. Seems to be off the radar now. Elmer is more
popular these days!”
“It also confirmed my suspicion that our eight-month-old son’s
name, Jackson, was rapidly gaining in popularity. Dangit, and we
thought he would avoid having 4 kids in kindergarten with the
same name!!!”
Thus usage of the NameVoyager thus follows a pattern in
which people look at different aspects of the data set, but have an
expectation that their particular findings will be interesting and
understandable to others. We term this pattern the “common
ground but unique perspective” principle.
Applying this principle in other situations may require some
flexibility in the data set, but it may also be possible to guide
people without modifying the data. For instance, imagine a
visualization tool designed to help people understand different
stock market investment strategies. Using well-known companies
or events as landmarks could provide common ground. At the
same time, there are several unique perspectives that people might
take: for instance, looking at how their own company’s stock has
performed, or how the market as a whole did at significant points
in their life. It is possible that the visualization could be tailored to
bring out these perspectives.
5.2

“We spent hours typing in the names of everyone we know.”
When a group uses a single-input software tool like the
NameVoyager, there are two distinct user roles. At any given
moment, one person will be active, controlling the input, while
others in the group will act as spectators. (These spectators may of
course be active in other ways, talking with each other and
making suggestions to the user controlling the input.)
Traditionally, interface designers have focused on the active
participant, but recently it has been suggested designing for the
spectator role creates important special considerations [9]. A
natural hypothesis is that a social data analysis tool should support
spectators as well as active participants.
Does the NameVoyager interface have special properties that
create a good spectator experience? Two notable features of the
NameVoyager are the smooth animation between states and the
unusually prominent text entry area. The animation was initially
added for the simple reason that it looked good, while the text
area indicates to novice users that they should start typing. These
two features, however, also give the NameVoyager an effective
spectator interface.
The prominent text area makes it easy for someone peering over
the shoulder of a user to see what is being typed. The immediate
letter-by-letter changes in the graphs give the display a live-action
quality, allowing spectators to see each step of the user’s thinking
process. The animation emphasizes the results of the typing, and
links successive states in a coherent progression. This avoids the
jarring feeling—familiar to anyone watching television while
someone else wields the remote control—of seeing a series of
sudden, unexpected changes.
Because both input and output are amplified, the NameVoyager
interface falls in the “expressive” quadrant of the spectator
interface taxonomy discussed by Reeves et al. in [9]. (The other
quadrants are termed “suspenseful,” “magical,” and “secretive.”)
We suggest that for information visualization, where clarity and
common understanding are critical, the “expressive” style of
spectator interface is best—and that there may be features, such as
animated transitions, that have larger value for groups than single
users.

Discovery Transfer

“Take a look at K and see how it exploded in the last decade or
two”
“Type in Adolph for example”
“You want some real fun, run ‘Hillary’”
What people are doing here, by hand, is creating a kind of
pointer into the application—that is, making a reference into a
particular state following interaction. The ability for users to
transfer their discoveries to others may be critical to the
conversation surrounding the NameVoyager.
Solitary,

'

The final hypothesis about how the NameVoyager encourages
social data exploration is that it allows people to share the state of
the visualization at any point in their explorations. Because the
interaction model is so simple—just a matter of typing a few
letters—it is very easy to guide other people to the same state.
And indeed, many comments on the web are written in the
imperative voice:

Expressive Spectator Interface

In many cases a group of two or more people used the
NameVoyager together. This is to be expected in the case of two
parents-to-be trying to find a name they both like, but also seemed
to occur in other contexts; as one person wrote,

'

asychronous usage can in this way become a shared experience.
The ease of "showing off" discoveries also fosters a motivating
sense of pride and competitiveness.
Thus a natural design principle might be that information
visualization software ought to provide “application-state
pointers” if it is intended to support collaborative analysis. Such
pointers could involve special URLs for later reference or some
other technology. A good example of an application-state pointer
in a commercial visualization tool comes from the web interface
to the Spotfire system [11], which allows users to make comments
about an online analysis. When reading a comment, another user
can view the exact state of the visualization (slider position, data,
etc.) seen by the comment’s author.
Note that allowing application-state pointers may impose some
subtle constraints. Some graph layout algorithms, for example,
involve random numbers, or depend on a long history of user
manipulations. These algorithms would need to be modified to
allow different people to see consistent views.
6

a simple experiment that might show that some feature, such as
animated transitions, has no value for a single user but provides a
significant benefit for a group?
Similarly, it would be helpful to investigate methods that allow
groups to coordinate their investigation. Application-state
pointers, we hypothesize, may be one way to do so, but present
engineering and algorithmic challenges, as well as more
conceptual ones. How should such pointers behave, for instance,
in an application where the underlying data is constantly
changing? The common ground / unique perspective hypothesis
says that it is helpful for users to have unique entry points into a
data set. Are there ways to encourage these unique viewpoints?
Could there be interfaces that show which parts of a data set have
been explored less heavily, giving people an incentive to find
overlooked gems?
Given the variety of questions to be asked, we believe exploring
further frameworks and design principles related to social data
analysis will be a fruitful avenue of investigation.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The NameVoyager is a visualization of baby name popularity
data, using keyboard-based interaction and smooth animation to
allow users to explore a set of 6,000 time series. The applet has
proven extremely popular, attracting hundreds of thousands of
users in the space of two months. In addition, thousands of
comments about the visualization have been written on the web.
This paper has explored the reaction to the NameVoyager,
using these web comments as evidence. This methodology is
somewhat unusual, but the sheer amount of online discussion of
the NameVoyager provides a useful source of detailed
descriptions from real users, and is a fruitful source of hypotheses
about how and why the NameVoyager is effective.
The comments reveal that the NameVoyager is popular even
among people who have no vested interest in looking for names—
the applet is somehow appealing to people even when it is not
solving an immediate problem. Moreover, users seem to be doing
extensive data mining with the application, finding for themselves
subtle patterns in the data. These facts make it all the more
interesting to understand the NameVoyager’s popularity, since it
may serve as a model for other situations, especially in education,
where the goal is to impart insight into a set of data that may not
be immediately relevant to a user.
A central observation made from comments found on the web is
that usage of the NameVoyager often involves a high degree of
dialogue between users. It seems, at least in some cases, to be a
social activity in which users discuss findings, set each other
puzzles, and draw inspiration from one another. We believe this
type of activity, which we term social data analysis, is the key to
the efficacy and popularity of the applet. The collaborative,
distributed nature means that people can join forces and share
knowledge; the social aspect, because it is intrinsically enjoyable,
may explain the applet’s appeal to users who state that they do not
like babies or are not interested in baby names.
Understanding the patterns of social data analysis seems like a
promising area for future research. This paper uses Bartle’s
taxonomy of players in multi-user online games as a starting point
for understanding the different roles of people interacting with the
NameVoyager. A natural area for further investigation would be
to test this idea, perhaps through user interviews and
questionnaires.
We have also proposed several design principles for social data
analysis, each of which requires validation. It would be
interesting, for example, to explore how effective “spectator
interfaces” might differ from standard interfaces. Indeed, is there
