A BSTRACT
A standard method of visualizing high-dimensional data is reducing its dimensionality to two or three using some algorithm, and
then creating a scatterplot with data represented by labelled and/or
colored dots. Two problems with this approach are (1) dots do not
represent data well, (2) reducing to just three dimensions does not
make full use of several dimensionality-reduction algorithms. We
demonstrate how Partiview can be used to solve these problems, in
the context of handwriting recognition and image retrieval.

by ’points’ of different colors. Points of the same color are clustered
together, indicating that the clustering algorithm is doing fairly well
at recognizing digits. However, it would be useful to examine more
closely where the algorithm fails, i.e. where differently-colored
digits are near each other.

P ROBLEM 1: D OTS POORLY REPRESENT DATA

For example, Figure 1 shows how well a clustering algorithm works
on a dataset of handwritten digits. Different digits are represented

† e-mail:

Partiview permits images to be placed at speciﬁc 3d coordinates,
always facing the user; they can also be placed with a ﬁxed orientation but this is not as useful for information visualization. In the
case where each datum is a handwritten digit, we can represent a
digit by itself, i.e. an image of the original digit. Our ﬁrst demo is
precisely this; as evidenced from Figures 2 and 3, which are closeups of Figure 1. For example, Figure 3 shows that the algorithm
mistakes 5’s with closed loops, and 3’s with thin tops, as 6’s.
In cases where the data has a natural visual representation, such

as images in image retrieval, faces in face recognition, or (snippets of) documents in information retrieval, the choice of images
for glyphs is straightforward. For example, Figures 4 and 5 show
how well another dimensionality reduction algorithm groups pictures according to their semantic content. The visualization shows
that while it achieves some success with grouping certain kinds of
images, such as those of ﬂags, it fails with other groups.
Of course, data in several domains have no natural visual correlate. Images would need to be created for each data point. One possibility is to have such images represent summaries of the data, such
as a pie chart showing the relative frequency bigrams in a ACGT
string in genomics.

view, as XGVis [3] does, three of the ten dimensions at a time. A
more general way, that Partiview supports, is specifying a 10 x 3
matrix that deﬁnes each spatial dimension as a weighted sum of
the 10 dimensions. Weights can make use of human intuition in a
semi-supervised form. For example, a human expert could mark a
few pairs of points as being similar or dissimilar, and the weights
could then be adjusted so that these pairs are kept as near or far,
respectively, from each other as possible.

Partiview is an interactive industrial-strength visualization tool.
The user can zoom/rotate/translate the data, and turn groups of data
points on and off with a press of a button. Data points can also be
turned on and off, or have their colors changed, based on the values
of certain ﬁelds associated with them.
The smoothness of the user experience depends on what computer is being used, in particular on its type of graphics hardware,
and if using many images, on the amount of graphics memory. A
recent laptop, with a GeForce FX Go5200 graphics card with 64
Mb of memory, can handle over ﬁve thousand handwritten digits,
each about 4k, and over a million points.

U SER E XPERIENCE

OTHER F EATURES OF PARTIVIEW

Partiview supports animations, and has several stereo capabilities,
including red-blue, crosseyed, and chromadepth. Stereo is especially good for displaying 3-dimensional graphs. Partiview can also
display some 3d models, so you can plot, for instance, a map of the
internet on a spherical textured Earth.
Partiview runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Binaries and
source are available from http://niri.ncsa.uiuc.edu/partiview/ .

S UMMARY

Partiview allows for easier qualitative evaluation of data clustering
algorithms by representing data by images instead of points or simple glyphs. For high-dimensional data, a combination of third-party
dimensionality reduction algorithms and Partiview’s ‘weighted dimension matrix’ feature form a powerful data exploration tool.

SIONS ?

REDUCE TO JUST THREE DIMEN -

If the data’s inherent dimensionality is larger than three, reducing
the number of dimensions to three loses, or even distorts, information. Besides, we have often found in practice that the ﬁrst three dimensions produced by dimensionality-reduction algorithms capture
some feature of the data that is certainly present, but not appropriate
for our needs.
It would be much nicer if the algorithm only had to reduce the
dimensionality of the data to, say, 10, and a good way of visualizing
10-dimensional data was available. One way of doing this is to
