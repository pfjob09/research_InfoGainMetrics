A BSTRACT
This paper presents visualization of field-measured, time-varying
multidimensional earthquake accelerograph readings. Direct volume rendering is used to depict the space-time relationships of
seismic readings collected from sensor stations in an intuitive way
such that the progress of seismic wave propagation of an earthquake
event can be directly observed. The resulting visualization reveals
the sequence of seismic wave initiation, propagation, attenuation
over time, and energy releasing events. We provide a case study on
the magnitude scale Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, which
is the most thoroughly recorded earthquake event ever in the history. More than 400 stations recorded this event, and the readings
from this event increased global strong-motion records five folds.
Each station measured east-west, north-south, and vertical component of acceleration for approximately 90 seconds. The sensor
network released the initial raw data within minutes after the ChiChi mainshock. It is essential to have a visualization system for
fast data exploring and analyzing, offering crucial visual analytical information for scientists to make quick judgments. Raw data
requires preprocessing before it can be rendered. We generated a
sequence of ground-motion wave-field maps of 350 × 200 regular
grid covers the entire Taiwan island from the sensor network readings. The result is a total of 1000 ground-motion wave-field maps
with 0.1 second interval, forming a 1000 × 350 × 200 volume data
set. We show that visualizing the time-varying component of the
data spatially uncovers the changing features hidden in the data.

I NTRODUCTION

In many areas of seismological science and earthquake engineering,
the multi-channel and time-varying components add difficulties in
data exploration. The field-measured data collected from an accelerograph instrumentation can contain thousands of time steps
and each time step has readings from three channels (east-west,
north-south, vertical). The collection of readings from a sensor network requires a huge amount of storage which creates challenges
for subsequent analysis. Without proper tools, it is difficult to uncover and observe the complex physical and mechanical phenomena contained in these data sets. In addition, the release of sensor network readings is crucial for providing needed information in
earthquake hazard response, damage assessment, and rescue planning. In the long term, the collection of sensor network readings
serves as a statistical database for estimating earthquake occurrence
probability and establishing safety factor design codes for civil infrastructure and buildings. These earthquake resistant structural design specifications are based on the history of earthquake records,
and structural engineers rely on them to design proper structural elements of a building. If the safety factor is set too high, it increases

the constructional costs. On the other hand, if it is set too low, the
buildings might suffer structural failures when a large earthquake
strikes. When a large earthquake occurs, scientists and engineers
are particularly interested in studying the peak ground acceleration
(PGA) map because it is an important influencing factor in choosing the proper safety design standards. The ability to interactively
detect and explore the hidden phenomena in data is essential. Visualization can enhance the understanding of complex behavior and
detect important features within the data. It is desirable for a visualization system to provide the functionality for changing viewpoints
and modifying color mappings and classification functions at an interactive rate.
This paper presents a study of a unique field-measured seismic
data set, capturing 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, using a
custom-made interactive volume visualization system. Unlike conventional approaches, we treat time-varying 2D data as volume
data. This allows scientists to capture the entire time evolution
of seismic waves propagation in 3D, providing unique properties,
which draws attention to data analysis. Data exploration functionalities such as changing viewpoints, zooming in and out, and interactive volume rendering of seismic data allows us to fully observe
the data from start to end. This greatly enhances the perception of
the sequence of important features in the data and provides unique
clues for further investigations. When the volume rendering of data
is further augmented with the PGA information, the directions of
wave propagation emerge from volume data and become clearly
observable. It is highly affected by the mechanical property of the
medium.

E ARTHQUAKE M ONITORING

Earthquake is one of the most devastating forces in nature. Instrumentation, observation, and archiving of strong ground motions
provide valuable data that holds the key to do analysis and thus
can aid in earthquake hazard mitigation and understanding of seismic wave propagation. The Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation
Program (TSMIP) completed the installation of strong-motion accelerographs in 1996 before the Chi-Chi earthquake occurred. The
strong-motion sensors record the dynamic surface motion. There
are approximately 700 digital accelerographs in free-field stations,
and more than 50 real-time seismic arrays installed in buildings and
bridges. With 3 km station spacing of free-field accelerographs in
urban area, Taiwan has the densest strong-motion instrument network in the world [20] compared to 25 km spacing of K-net strong
motion seismograph network in Japan [15]. Typical accelerographs
have ±2 g scale, 200 or higher sampling rate, 16-bit precision, and
20 second pre-event recording with a Global Positioning System
(GPS) receiver that can be used to synchronize the internal clock to
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) [23].
The TSMIP accelerograph readings of the Chi-Chi earthquake
event were investigated in this study. Figure 1(a) shows the locations of stations that recorded the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. The
central part of Taiwan is the mountainous area; due to this reason, stations are not set up. The accelerograph readings are time
stamped, i.e., the starting time that triggered the sensor is recorded.
Figure 2 shows a sample strong-motion acceleration readings of a
TSMIP station, TCU078 (120.84 ◦ E, 23.81 ◦ N), 8 km from the epicenter of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. The typical readings of a
station are plotted in 2D with the horizontal axis representing time
and the vertical axis presenting the recorded readings. The time
history of the accelerograph readings describes the dynamic motion of ground surface. In East-West channel, the positive readings
represent eastward accelerations, and negative readings represent
westward accelerations.

km segment of a thrust fault, causing remarkably surface scarps and
10 meters vertical displacement in some segments. Because of the
enormous energy released from the mainshock, it caused heavy casualties and large damages to the infrastructures. More than 2,000
dead, approximately 11,000 injured, and about 100,000 structures
destroyed. Its epicenter was at 120.815 ◦ E and 23.853 ◦ N, and its
hypocenter was 8 km deep. It was the most devastating earthquake
to hit Taiwan and caused a surface rupture with 100 km long [19].
The Chi-Chi earthquake and its aftershocks have resulted in the
richest seismological data recording in the world at that time in
both quality and quantity (calibrated with high confident level), and
may remain so for a long period of time [22] with over 60 strongmotion recordings within 20 km from the epicenter. The first time
in history a large earthquake is monitored by such an amount of instruments so close to the epicenter. It is the only recorded event in
the world with Mw larger than 7.6, Chelungpu fault rupture length
of over 100 km long, and many PGA larger than 1g records [19].
Due to the contributions of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake recordings, the world’s total holdings of strong-motion data increased five
times.. This makes the Chi-Chi earthquake a unique event because
of its completeness of available recordings. Therefore, in emergency response, the Taiwan Rapid Earthquake Information Release
System was capable of releasing information within minutes after
the event, and the collected information was used in planning rescue missions. Visualization of field-measured seismic readings can
aid in the process of making critical emergency response decisions.

There are mainly two sources of seismic data sets: (i) numerical
simulations, and (ii) field-measured. Earthquake simulations are
important because they helps researchers better understand seismic
wave propagation characteristics and establish proper earthquake
response plans to mitigate seismic hazards. Field-measured data
is particularly useful in verifying data from earthquake simulation.
Without interactive visualizations, data exploration would be difficult to achieve.
Visualization of Simulation Seismic Data

Former researchers used a variety of approaches such as 2D snapshot images or videos to visualize time-varying earthquake simulation data. Mavroeidis et al. [13] used a series of 2D images,
taken at equal time intervals, to show the evolution of groundmotion simulations over time. Similarly, Hirahara et al. [6] conducted simulations of complex fault system ruptures and used a sequence of 2D plots to reveal the spatio-temporal evolution of seismic waves. Sometimes, large 3D simulation of earthquake ground
motions were overlaid on maps [4]. When the simulation results
were plotted on static images, how to present the time-varying information was an issue. Antolik et al. [2] presented their wave propagation simulations using a video showing the seismic waves overlapping a 2D map.
large-scale simulation was important in understanding of earthquakes. However, it produced huge amounts of data. In order to
fully explore the large data, researchers used parallel processing
to enhance computing performance. Zhang et al. [28] developed
parallel rendering algorithms to visualize time-varying 3D volume
data from earthquake simulations. Akcelik et al. [1] used a 3000processor supercomputer to simulate an earthquake in the Los Angeles Basin; the wave propagating volume data results were displayed in a sequence of 2D snapshots. Ma et al. [12] presented
a parallel rendering algorithm for time-varying volume data on a
128-processor supercomputer, revealing 3D seismic wave propagation originating from the hypocenter of a simulated earthquake
event. In another example, Yu et al. [26] presented a parallel visualization algorithm for studying a large earthquake simulation to
model 3D seismic wave propagation of the 1994 Northridge earth-

quake. Chourasia et al. [5] presented a cast study of visualizing
large-scale earthquake simulations on a supercomputer, encoding
the rendered images into animations. These works dealt with data
of simulation results. This decomposition of simulation and visualization became undesired as the large simulations moved into terascale and petascale. In contrast, Tu et al. [24] presented another type
of system, which simulation components and visualization were
tightly coupled together so that real-time rendering of simulation
data was made possible. Chopra et al. [3] presented a visualization
work of earthquake simulation data to enhance collaboration between structural engineers, seismologists, and computer scientists
in an immersive virtual environment to present the simulation data
better. These simulations provide a mean to better understand the
earthquake, however, it is also important to verify simulation results
with field-collected seismic data. Komatitsch et al. [7] conducted a
global-scale simulation of seismic wave propagation and superimposed the simulation data over field-measured waveforms data.
3.2

Visualization of Field-Measured Seismic Data

Large field-measured seismic data sets posed significant challenges
for processing and analyzing. Yuen et al. [27] presented a webbased system for visualizing seismic data in a grid environment. A
conventional approach to analyze the field-collected data sets was
to study earthquake induced effects as time histories by plotting
and comparing discrete waveforms. Wolfe et al. [25] presented a
visualization system for examining the seismic volume data generated from ultrasound reflections, looking for high-amplitude seismic events through a synoptic view of the interior. Tools were developed for interpreting and illustrating 2D slices of seismic volumetric reflection data [16]. Nayak et al. [14] used 3D glyphs,
graphics primitives or symbols with various geometric and color attributes, to represent the measured seismic data. These glyphs were
rendered in real time and combined with a 3D topography terrain
map. In particular, 3D visualization can provide visual clues via
an intuitive representation of the time-varying information that is
difficult to represent with traditional 2D techniques. Visual analytics tools are aimed to aid the process of analyzing field-measured
seismic data sets and leading to new discoveries. When properly
georeferenced and treated, seismic data sets can be presented in a
natural form that facilitates the understanding of governing mechanisms. For example, the peak ground-motion map can be computed from sensor readings of an earthquake. It is a static map
showing the recorded peak values of different locations during an
earthquake.
A series of 2D ground-motion wave-field maps over time can be
generated from the field-measured records of an earthquake event.
A single ground-motion wave-field map only shows a snapshot of
acceleration readings at a particular time. In contrast, a sequence of
ground-motion wave-field maps show the initiation and propagation
progress of ground motions. These wave-filed maps can be used to
generate a video clip for further analysis. From the playback of a
video clip, the time history of ground motions can be observed. Using the sensor network readings from the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake,
Shin and Teng [19] produced a video of 100 time frames, presented
at one frame per second, showing the ground motions from start
to finish throughout the island. In their approach, each station was
treated as a pixel and interpolation was used to fill the empty pixels
between stations. In addition, they used a low-pass filter to trim the
high frequency portion of the signals to avoid breaking up wavefield maps. From the playback of the video, major energy releases
were determined in time and space. A major energy release was defined as an event that emerged at the surface in an area of nearly 10
km in radius with accelerations of 350 gal and larger. They pointed
out that major energy releases happened at 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19,
20, 21, 23, 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 43, and 50 seconds from origin time.
Some of the major energy releases were from adjacent active faults

triggered by the bursts of extensive energy releases of the mainshock. From the examination of the time-space relationship of the
major energy releases, they further concluded that there was no particular order with which these energy releases took place, Shin and
Teng called this type of rupture jumping dislocations. Stress field
was irregular along the fault zones; dislocation occurred where the
stress concentration exceeded the rock strength.
In order to fully present the time history of the field-measured
ground motions, new approaches are needed to provide a spatially
and temporally anchored, visual representation of the earthquake
phenomenon. Different from previous methods of using a video to
show the time-history of the sensor readings, Romero Summet [17]
presented a system to visualize the entire contents of a video by
stacking frames up in sequence. This approach enabled longitudinal analysis of the aggregation of contents in a video. In a similar
way, a sequence of wave-filed maps can be stacked up in 3D. In this
paper, a new approach was presented to visualize the world’s most
complete field-measured earthquake ground-motion readings. Volume rendering techniques were used to examine the unstructured
time-varying seismic data. Compared to conventional approaches,
volume rendering provided new perspectives to look at the data.
These visual paradigms provided an enhanced understanding of the
field-measured seismic data. When coupled with feature extracting
techniques, interactive visualization played a crucial role in exploring the seismic data.

V ISUALIZATION

OF

ACCELEROGRAPH R EADINGS

Since most of the TSMIP accelerographs have absolute timing
tuned with GPS receiver timing and all stations have accurate relative timing, a common time reference was inputted into all records.
The seismic sensor readings from the Chi-Chi earthquake was used
to generate a sequence of ground-motion wave-field maps. Because the TSMIP sensor network has the densest station distribution in the world, the resolution produced from the raw data was
enhanced significantly, showing more completed ground-motion
wave-field maps. Our seismologist collaborator suggested that surface fitting [18] should be used to interpolate the regular grid map.
It models a surface (fits grid values) from scattered data in the
form of z(x, y) for each channel. Using biharmonic operator in
2D achieves minimum curvature interpolation of irregularly spaced
sampled points, so the result surface always passes through the sampled data points. Since scientists are mostly interested in studying
energy, absolute values are used for the readings of the three channels in this study. Figure 1(b) shows a snapshot of ground-motion
wave-field map (regular grid of resolution 350 × 200) generated by
using surface fitting. Each pixel presents an area of approximately
1 km2 . The color transfer function input is calculated from the amplitude of the three channels (east-west, north-south, vertical). The
region of over 400 gal acceleration is indicated in red, while the
region of lower acceleration is in blue.
In this research, a total of 1000 ground-motion wave-field maps
with a 0.1 second interval are generated from the sensor network
readings of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. These maps are stacked
up in sequence to form a 1000 × 350 × 200 volume data to present
the time-varying information in spatial form. This approach allows
the time-varying information to be presented spatially. Volume rendering is used because it provides a means to present the seismic
wave propagation sequence of an earthquake over time, allowing
seismologists to observe the seismic wave propagation at a glance.
Volume rendering is particularly useful in presenting the spatiotemporal relationship of the energy releases in volume data. The
purpose is to discover the size and shape of the energy releases
through color-coding the volume data.

4.1 Direct Volume Rendering of Wave-Field Volume
Direct volume rendering using ray casting is a well-developed rendering technique that can visualize the internal structure of the 3D
volume data. It displays the data directly without constructing geometric primitives to the samples first. Modern programmable GPUs
accelerates ray casting, making volume rendering more usable and
attractive. Formerly, Kruger and Westermann [8] presented a GPUbased ray caster implemented in the fragment shader with early
termination and empty space skipping features. Another example, Lum et al. [11] presented a GPU-based volume rendering technique for interactive visualization of the time-varying volume data.
In their design, a palette-based decoding technique was developed
to fully utilize the texture mapping capability. The incremental
subrange integration was proposed [10] to speed up pre-integrated
volume rendering, which can minimize artifacts caused by regular
sampling and generate high-quality visualization. A single-pass ray
caster was developed by [21] to perform pre-integrated direct volume rendering.
In this study, a GPU-based ray casting was developed for the
visualization of seismic volume data sets, allowing for both orthogonal and perspective projection. It also enables the user to freely
move the viewpoint around the volume data. The temporal information of the field-measured seismic data sets is visualized spatially
so that the time history can be directly observed. Figure 3 shows
the volume rendering of the wave-field volume data generated from
acceleration records of 446 stations during the Chi-Chi earthquake.
The most intensive energetic area (with reddish color tones) can be
clearly identified, providing a good indication of the epicenter location. Figure 4 shows the volume rendering in three orthographic
viewing angles. This approach brings new perspectives in studying
sensor network readings, providing seismologists new visual analytical tools for verifying seismic mechanism. Visualizing sensor
network reading reveals the sequence of seismic wave initiation,
propagation, attenuation over time, and energy releasing events.

Figure 4: Orthographic views of volume rendering (front-view, topview, and side-view). The temporal information is interpreted and
presented spatially by treating time information as the third axis. The
largest damage occurred at UTC 17:47:27.7 when the maximum acceleration was recorded.

4.2.1

Magnitude Scheme

The magnitude color scheme computes the magnitude from three
channels (east-west, north-south, and vertical) and uses it as the
input to the transfer function. A user interface is developed for
interactively modification of the transfer function. To highlight significant events, a transfer function allows the user to see through
the volume data. This is done by assigning high transparency to
those voxels with small magnitude values, and high opaque values
to those voxels with large values.
In Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau seismic intensity scale
is used to indicate the strength of an earthquake in various parts of
the island. The scale measures the seismic intensity of earth’s surface and the degree of seismic activity is divided into 8 categories.
Therefore, the measured intensity level varies from place to place
in an earthquake. The transfer function can be adjusted to show
regions of different intensity scale individually. Figure 5(a) shows
the screen shots of different intensity levels in volume rendering
of the Chi-Chi data. The blue, cyan, green, yellow, and red color
are used to represent category 3 to category 7 bubbles respectively.
Figure 5(c) shows that some of the major energy releases were from
adjacent active faults triggered by the bursts of extensive energy releases of the mainshock. During shocks at intensity scale category
7, even highly earthquake resistant buildings are severely damaged.
Through visualization, different regions showed different intensity
levels, providing insight to estimate potential damages of buildings
that encounter category 7 seismic activity.

Three-Channel Scheme

The three-Channel color scheme highlights three-channel components. Figure 6 shows the volume rendering of wave-filed volume
data using the second color scheme. The red, green, and blue color
is determined by the acceleration in the channel that dominates respectively, e.g., the red indicates the vertical acceleration is larger
than the north-south and east-west acceleration, the green indicates
the north-south acceleration is dominant, and the blue indicates the
east-west acceleration is dominant. In an earthquake, the vertical
ground acceleration can amplify the horizontal ground acceleration [9]. This visualization shows that the red dominant voxels
mostly appear in the early readings of the stations. This can be
explained by the fact that the arriving primary wave is coming directly from the hypocenter below the ground, traveling faster than
other types of seismic waves. Without this kind of visualization, it

would be difficult to understand the overall distribution of the vertical dominant and the horizontal dominant. Furthermore, each of
the red, green, and blue component can be faded out to individually
examine the readings from each channel. For example, the vertical
component can be completely faded out to highlight the horizontal
accelerations. As shown in Figure 7, low energy regions are faded
out to highlight large energy regions (>350 gal) in the second color
scheme. It clearly shows that the amplitude of the horizontal motions is strongly dependent on the earthquake intensity. In large energy regions, the horizontal motions are dominant. In contrast, the
vertical motions are less sensitive to the earthquake intensity and
are not the dominant component in large intensity regions. Since
the vertical accelerations are not significant, structural engineers
mainly look at horizontal acceleration in earthquake resistant structural design. However, the visualization system presented in this
paper can be applied in identifying those large vertical acceleration
regions. When the vertical acceleration is larger, it is still a considering factor in the analysis of structural response subjected to both
horizontal and vertical ground accelerations.
4.3

Real-Time User Interaction

The presented system provides the following two functionalities:
(i) cut away and (ii) slicing.
Cut away: The cut away feature allows the user to focus on
the regions of interests. For example, zooming into the regions of
a particular energy release event and isolating it from the others.
Figure 8 shows the volume rendering of the central regions of the
wave-filed volume data.
Slicing: The visualization system has a slicing tool to go through
layers for displaying ground-motion wave-field maps. A layer of
the volume data is a static ground-motion map. Figure 9 shows
wave-field snapshots at 40 and 65 seconds from the origin of the
earthquake. The user uses a slider to display a layer, highlighting
the important moments of any event. It provides a tomographic
view of the data that allows the user to go through time sequences,
observing the seismic wave propagation over time.
4.4

Showing the Structure of Time History

Examining time-space relationships of accelerograph readings can
reveal important features of an earthquake event. For example, the
order of rupture is observed from studying the seismic wave propagation over time. One way to study the time-space relationship
of accelerograph readings is to identify the exact time of PGA in a
station. The acceleration at a given time is the vector sum of three

Figure 6: The three-channel color scheme uses red, green, and blue
to represent the vertical, north-south, and east-west channel respectively. The red represents that the voxel is dominated by the vertical
component, i.e., the vertical acceleration is larger than the horizontal
acceleration. The green and blue represent that the voxel is dominated by the north-south acceleration and the east-west acceleration
respectively. Visualization of red dominant voxels shows a finding
that vertical acceleration appears in the early stage of the earthquake. As can be observed, the vertical ground acceleration can
amplify the horizontal ground acceleration.

acceleration vectors from the three recording channels. The occurring time of PGA can be precisely calculated from the readings.
The recorded PGA value of a sensor station indicates the earthquake intensity in a specific geographic area, while the PGA time
of that station indicates when a station experiences the most intense
acceleration. The PGA is the parameter most commonly used in
earthquake engineering. Seismologists are interested in finding out
the occurring time of the PGA value at a station because it indicates
when the most seismic wave energy propagates through this area.
Since there were 446 sensor stations used in this study, a total
number of 446 PGA times were computed from the data. Figure 10
shows the volume rendering was augmented with the PGA occurring times of 446 stations. For each station, a sphere was rendered

sphere indicates the time when the PGA occurs in the station. Observing the earthquake energy distribution over time helps scientists
understand both wave propagation and fault rupture processes. The
locations of the PGA times provide insights into understanding how
seismic waves propagate from the epicenter. Another finding is that
the distribution of these spheres is consistent with the trend of bubble formation. Without volume rendering and data augmentation,
this phenomenon would be difficult to be observed.
In order to capture the overall trend of how seismic waves propagate from the epicenter, an experimental approach was used to examine the distribution of seismic energy releases. Each sphere was
connected with its closest neighbor using a 3D minimum spanning
tree (MST). A MST is a tree with the shortest distance of any other
spanning tree. The structure of the MST can give insights on how
the seismic waves propagate throughout the island. As shown in
Figure 10, the spheres of PGA times are connected by a 3D MST.
High energy regions are faded out to highlight the MST structure,
showing two trends appear in the second half of the volume data.
The overall structure of MST suggests how the seismic waves in-

teract and with the inhomogeneous crust. The MST edges provide visual clues for seismologists to better understand the artificial
time-space relationship of PGA recording times among stations in
the sensor network. The following observations were made from
the volume rendering augmented with MST: (i) The PGA times
of those stations near the epicenter are located mostly within the
first 35 seconds after the origin time. (ii) For the next 35 seconds,
two trends begin to emerge, leading into two different directions.
One trend leads into the northeastern part of Taiwan (the basin); the
other trend leads into the southwestern part of Taiwan (the plain).
(iii) From 70 to 100 seconds, these two trends separate further from
each other. (iv) The MST structure suggests that the northeastern
part and the southwestern part of Taiwan still reverberate towards
the end of the readings.
5 R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
The visualization system presented in this paper achieved 30 frames
per second on a commodity PC with Core 2 Duo CPU, 2GB memory, and a GeForce 9600 graphics when the ray casting sample
spacing is 0.005. Direct volume rendering provided visual clues
for identifying major energy releases in the volume data that reflected 100 seconds duration of the sensor network readings. In
the past, seismologists watched a video for 100 seconds to perform
the same task. As a result, seismologists had to replay the video
multiple times to identify major energy releases. Direct volume
rendering offers an alternative approach to examine the data with
various visualization techniques. This would speed up the process
in assisting seismologists to understand the formation and dissipation of major energy releases. When the Chi-Chi earthquake data
was volume-rendered, scientists were able to gain some new insights. Using volume rendering combined with the augmentation
techniques, our seismologists collaborators discovered two findings: First, major energy releases occurred within the first half of
the volume data (first 50 seconds after the earthquake). Second,
some parts of Taiwan remained reverberating toward the second
half of the data (from 50 to 100 seconds after the earthquake).
Identifying Major Energy Releases: Major energy releases are
shown in a series of concentric isoseismal contours, indicating the
propagating direction of outgoing wavefronts. When chosen a suitable transfer function, the distribution of energy releases over time
is seen through volume rendering. It reveals the initiation and the
dispersion of the major energy releases. As shown in Figure 11, the
major energy releases are identified as a cluster of irregular bubbles
with high-energy cores shown in red and surrounding green layers

Figure 10: Volume rendering is augmented with the PGA occurring times of 446 stations connected by a 3D minimum spanning tree. It provides
insights into understanding how seismic waves propagate from epicenter. Another finding is that the distribution of these spheres is consistent
with the trend of bubble formation.

of shells. The evolution of these bubbles provides a good indication of how seismic waves propagate throughout the island. Examining major energy releases leads to the following observations: (i)
Major energy releases are mostly spotted in the early stage of the
earthquake. (ii) These bubble-shape regions indicate the locations
of strong energy releases. The epicenter can be identified by looking at the volume rendering directly. In fact, the epicenter is located
near the first few major energy releases. (iii) The amount of energy
released in an earthquake can be roughly estimated from the size of
the bubble-shaped regions. Volume rendering showed the duration
and impact areas of major energy releases. The spatial relationship
between these bursts of energy indicated the order of ruptures. As
seismic waves initiated from the epicenter and propagated outward,
nearby faults were triggered into motion. The rupture dislocation
phenomena can be identified in volume rendering. These findings
from direct visual observation pointed out a new direction for further investigation. Our collaborators used direct volume rendering to search for high energy bubbles in the surrounding areas of
the epicenter and farther regions. Seismologists explained that major energy releases farther away from the epicenter were caused by
seismic waves bringing energy to trigger fault ruptures and releasing more energy in return. In fact, the Chi-Chi earthquake triggered
two Mw 6 events on two other known faults nearby to the Chi-Chi
mainshock epicenter.
Identifying Soft Surface Sediments Effects: When the ChiChi earthquake volume data was georeferenced with digital terrain
models, it indicated information of topographic effects. Toward the
second half of the data, the volume rendering showed that the basin
on Taiwan’s northern tip, the deposition plain on northeast coast,
and the western plain remained reverberating with motions. In contrast, the other parts of Taiwan almost stop all seismic activities.
This finding is consistent with the fact that soft surface sediments
amplify and prolong ground motions [19].

C ONCLUSIONS

Because of the high density of strong-motion sensor stations from
the TSMIP sensor network, the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake data sets
have the richest recordings in modern times. The rupturing process and the wave propagation were well recorded. A volume data
was made from the accelerograph readings of the earthquake. Compared with conventional methods plotting ground accelerations on a
2D map, volume rendering of the accelerograph readings provides
alternative aspects to examine the time-space relationships of unusual events in the data. The case study presented in this paper

demonstrates the use of volume rendering for data exploration and
visual analysis. We also augment visualizations with careful color
coding, PGA times, and the MST.
From volume rendering, our collaborators in Taiwan National
Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering have been able to
gain the following insights: (i) Interesting features in the data can be
identified when interactively adjusting the transfer function. Magnitude color scheme is used to classify regions into different seismic
intensity levels. The three-channel color scheme shows that the vertical accelerations are larger than the horizontal accelerations in the
early readings of the stations. (ii) The distribution of PGA times
and the structure of MST suggest the overall propagation structure.
Two trends emerge in the second half of the volume data, one trend
is guided toward the northeastern basin, the other trend is guided
toward the southwestern sedimentary plain. This demonstrates soft
sediments can trap, amplify, and prolong seismic activities. (iii)
Volume rendering is used to identify regions with strong accelerations, as known as major energy releases, which are shown as irregular contiguous bubbles. The size of the bubbles is determined
by the amount of energy release. (iv) Seismologists conclude that
major energy releases do not occur in particular order in time or

71

space. The major energy release caused by the fault rupture of the
mainshock has larger size and longer duration than others.
Insights gained through visualization aid seismologists in understanding earthquake characteristics. Future research in examining
accelerograph readings of other large earthquakes to find similar
phenomena would give more insights of the earthquake’s characteristics. From volume rendering, the major energy release bubbles
can be interpreted as the locations of fault ruptures. This can be
used to search for unknown faults. In addition, the bubbles reveal
the rock strain along the faults in inhomogeneous crust. Furthermore, better understanding of seismic wave propagation patterns
at different topological regions can provide reference data in evaluating and developing the probability-based earthquake resistant
structural design criteria. Volume visualization of the seismic data
can help guide the future deployment of equipment. In conclusion,
volume rendering of field-measured TSMIP accelerograph readings
can be used to verify earthquake simulations and to cross-reference
readings from other types of seismological sensor data such as GPS
instruments and aftershock data.
