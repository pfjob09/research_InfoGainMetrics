Outlook for Visual Analytics Research Funding
Panelists:

Summary

Jim Thomas
Panel Organizer

Visual Analytics has become a rapidly growing field of study. It is also a field that is addressing very significant real world problems in homeland security, business analytics, emergency
management, genetics and bioinformatics, investigative analysis, medical analytics, and other
areas. For both these reasons, it is attracting new funding and will continue to do so in the
future.
Visual analytics has also become an international field, with significant research efforts in
Canada, Europe, and Australia, as well as the U.S. There is significant new research funding
in Canada and Germany with other efforts being discussed, including a major program sponsored by the European Union.
The contributors to this panel are some of the primary thought leaders providing
research funding or involved in setting up the funding apparatus. We have asked them to
present their needs, funding programs, and expectations from the research community. They
all come from different perspectives, different missions, and different expectations. They will
present their views of the range of activity in both the U.S. and internationally and discuss
what is coming.
Come learn about these programs, initiatives, and plans, and how you can contribute.
