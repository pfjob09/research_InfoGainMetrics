A BSTRACT
Predicting protein structures has long been a grand-challenge problem. Fine-grained computational simulation of folding events from
a protein’s synthesis to its final stable structure remains computationally intractable. Therefore, methods which derive constraints
from other sources are attractive. To date, constraints derived from
known structures have proven to be highly successful. However,
these cannot be applied to molecules with no identifiable neighbors
having already-determined structures. For such molecules, structural constraints must be derived in other ways. One popular approach has been the statistical analysis of large families of proteins,
with the hope that residues that “change together” (co-evolve) imply that those residues are in contact. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to use this data to deduce structural constraints, this
approach has met with minimal success. The consensus of current
literature concludes that there is simply too little information contained within the correlated mutations of many protein families to
reliably and generally predict structural constraints.
Recent work in my laboratory challenges this conclusion. For
some time we have been developing methods (MAVL/StickWRLD)
to visualize the pattern of co-evolved mutations within sequence
families. While our analysis of individual correlations agrees with
the literature consensus, we have recently discovered that the visualized pattern of correlations is highly suggestive of structural
relationships. In our preliminary test cases, human researchers can
unambiguously determine many positive structural constraints by
visual analysis of statistical sequence information alone, often with
no training on interpretation of the visualization results.
Herein we report the visualization design that supports this Visual Analytics approach to identifying high-confidence hypotheses
about protein folding from protein sequence, and illustrate preliminary results from this research. Our approach entails a higherdimensional extension of parallel coordinates which illuminates
distant shared sub-tuples of the vectors representing each protein
sequence when these sub-tuples occur with an over abundance compared to expectations. It simultaneously eliminates all representations of tuples which occur with frequency near the expected norm.
The result is a minimally-occluded representation of outlier, and
only outlier co-occurrences within the sequence families.

Figure 1: A Visual Analytics approach can suggest structural relationships in a molecule of unknown structure, directly from the correlated
mutational patterns in its sequence family. Every user, regardless
of training, is immediately drawn to the left, right, top and bottom regions of this StickWRLD diagram. These residues are in fact contacting. The surprising ease with which this hypothesis can be reached
visually, and the surprising reliability of the hypotheses generated
this way, belies the tremendous difficulty encountered in making the
same types of predictions on purely statistical grounds. For visual
tractability in printed form, this figure is drawn from Archaeal tRNAs.
Residue identities and propensities are indicated by colored spheres
around the periphery. Positive and Negative associations between
residues are shown by white and red lines. The diameter of the lines
indicates the strength of the association. The live visualization is actually an interactive explorable 3-dimensional data space.

fundamentally intractable from physical first principles. The richest
purely-bioinformatic source of constraints that could simplify the
calculation has long been expected to be the patterns of co-evolved
mutations. Such mutations can be extracted from an aligned sequence family alone, and do not require any structural data. Despite
extensive work by many researchers, constraints of this nature have
proven surprisingly difficult to accurately identify[1].

E XPOSITION

In the hope of understanding why these correlations are so difficult
to find, my lab has, for several years, been exploring visualization
techniques to assist our analysis of the correlation patterns[3]. The
technique upon which we have settled treats each protein sequence
as a high-dimensional vector, with each serial position along the sequence being a dimension, and the amino-acid used at the ith posi-

tion in a particular protein sequence in the family being the categorical value for that sequence at the ith coordinate. We represent this
data using an extension and adaptation of parallel-coordinates[2].
The canonical parallel coordinates representation makes it easy to
see general family trends, and also nearest-neighbor correlations (in
fact, it forms a visual representation of the statistical construct that
would be familiar to the Biologist as a Hidden Markov Model), but
it does not capture or represent correlations between coordinates
that are sequentially distant. Because interacting residues within
proteins are not constrained to be nearest sequential neighbors, and
in fact can occur anywhere across the length of the sequence, we
also need to represent distant relationships. To do this, we augment the canonical parallel coordinates representation. In addition
to the traditional representation of a vector as a single trace through
the diagram, we add every other pairwise edge that occurs for each
vector. That is, where the traditional parallel coordinates diagram
represents each vector as a polyline with a segment connecting the
values at each sequential ith and jth position, we represent the vector as a properly complete undirected graph on the parallel coordinates space, with an edge connecting the values at every kth and
nth position, regardless of whether k and n are sequential. It is easy
to imagine that this representation quickly becomes too chaotic to
be useful – however, we employ three other extensions which, in
application to real biological data, reduce the clutter to such an extent that the representation is clarified. The first of these is that we
subtract from this representation, all edges which are statistically
“expected”. If a particular sequence position in the protein family
always uses one particular amino acid (every vector has the same
value at its mth coordinate), the edges detailing that position’s relationships to every other position are completely uninformative, so
we remove them. Likewise, a statistical expectation can be calculated (from the protein sequence statistics) for the number of edges
that should occur between category A at position k and category B at
position n, so we remove that expected sub-population as well. Secondly, because our values are categorical, there are numerous subsets of edges that are colinear and share both endpoints. For each
such subset we aggregate all member edges into a single “fat” edge,
with a weight that represents the count of members that composed
it. Finally, we transform the canonical parallel coordinates planar
space onto the surface of a cylinder. This transformation makes
every possible coordinate:value to coordinate:value pair lie upon a
unique line, thereby eliminating overlaps and creating a minimally
occluded representation of the remaining edges.
The result is that we are left with a 3-dimensional geometric
representation (browsable, for example in VRML) of the statistically unexpected co-occurrences within our protein sequence vector
space. These unexpected co-occurrences tend to be relatively few
in number. Even after aggregation which reduces the edge count
to roughly n6 where n is the number of proteins in the family, the
“proper complete graph” version of the diagram, for a mediumsized protein that is 300 amino acids in length, contains over 39
million edges. After subtracting expectations, this reduces to typically a few thousand remaining “interesting” edges.
We have recently discovered, through a serindipitous accident,
that visualizing these remaining interesting edges at particularly
low statistical stringency, results in the appearance of visually distinct “clouds” of edges. This phenomenon is shown in Figure 2.
Despite the fact that the majority of the edges shown in 2(d) are
within the noise floor, the handful of visually distinct features are
actually real structural contacts. This can be contrasted with the few
edges shown in the much more statistically reliable 2(a), where only
3 of the 4 edges are real contacts. Preliminary analysis suggests that
these clouds are both a statistical phenomenon, and a biophysical
consequence of a particular type of protein contact.

(a) The most significant correlations, with p ≤ 0.005, have no obvious visual pattern.

(b) As the significance is weakened, here p ≤ 0.010, more correlations appear.

(c) When correlations with p as
poor as 0.050 are shown, distinct
patterns begin to appear in the
cloud of minimal-significance correlations.

(d) Even when the significance is
only p ≤ 0.100, the cloud of weak
correlations remains visually focused around certain areas in the
diagram.

Figure 2: These diagrams show StickWRLD visualizations for the
correlated mutations within Adenylate Kinase. They are arranged in
order of decreasing statistical significance. While it is far less obvious
in a small image on paper, the user’s eye is immediately drawn to the
dense cluster of correlation lines to the right side of the circle, then
to the more diffuse region of vertical correlation lines at the left of
the circle, and finally to the diagonals from the top of the left bundle
into the dense right bundle, and from the bottom of the left bundle to
the dense bundle. These are in fact interacting clusters of residues.
Other features of the diagrams are described in detail in [3].

C ONCLUSION

We are convinced from our preliminary experiments with our system, that this visual analytics approach to structural prediction generalizes well. While the parameters are not identical from protein
to protein, it is easy for a user to tune the visualization to detect
these “low significance clouds” of associations. They appear to occur in most proteins. We are further optimistic that this approach
will identify a subclass of correlation patterns that are amenable
to discovery by machine learning, thereby augmenting the ability
of the computational biology community, and helping to explain
why unbiased statistical methods have so-far proven unsuccessful
in making these predictions.
