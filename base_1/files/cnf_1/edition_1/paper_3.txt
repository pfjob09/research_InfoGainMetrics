How Editing and Design Changes News Graphics
Amanda Cox
New York Times

Abstract

Bio

The Times graphics department has won many national and
international awards, including the National Design Award
for communication design. Learn how graphics editors
report, design and edit data visualizations, integrate interactivity with story telling, and explain the news. How do basic
ideas from journalism — including the importance of editing
— influence the graphics the Times makes?

Amanda Cox is a member of the New York Times graphics department, a 25-person team of visual journalists that
explain, illustrate and contextualize the news for the newspaper and nytimes.com. She joined the Times in 2005, after
receiving a master’s degree in statistics from the University
of Washington.
