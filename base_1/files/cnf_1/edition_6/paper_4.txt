ABSTRACT

1.1

GeoTime and nSpace are new analysis tools that provide
innovative visual analytic capabilities. This paper uses an
epidemiology analysis scenario to illustrate and discuss these new
investigative methods and techniques. In addition, this case study
is an exploration and demonstration of the analytical synergy
achieved by combining GeoTime’s geo-temporal analysis
capabilities, with the rapid information triage, scanning and sensemaking provided by nSpace.
A fictional analyst works through the scenario from the initial
brainstorming through to a final collaboration and report. With the
efficient knowledge acquisition and insights into large amounts of
documents, there is more time for the analyst to reason about the
problem and imagine ways to mitigate threats. The use of both
nSpace and GeoTime initiated a synergistic exchange of ideas,
where hypotheses generated in either software tool could be crossreferenced, refuted, and supported by the other tool.

nSpace combines several interactive visualization techniques to
create a unified workspace that supports the analytic process. One
technique, called TRIST (The Rapid Information Scanning Tool),
uses multiple linked views to support rapid and efficient scanning
and triaging of thousands of search results in one display. The
other technique, called the Sandbox, supports both ad-hoc and
formal sense making within a flexible free thinking environment.
Additionally, nSpace makes use of multiple advanced
computational linguistic functions using a web services interface
and protocol [6, 3].

nSpace - A Unified Analytical Workspace

TRIST

TRIST, as seen in Figure 1, uses advanced information retrieval
methods to support rapid scanning and exploration of large
datasets. The design of TRIST was informed by recent research
into information retrieval [4,7,17], the development of the
cognitive dimensions framework [5], and the idea of an
information-seeking environment [8].
TRIST supports multiple analytical processes, including query
planning, rapid scanning of large corpus of documents, and result
characterization across multiple dimensions [12]. Analysts work
with TRIST to triage their massive data and to extract information
into the Sandbox evidence marshalling environment.

INTRODUCTION

GeoTime and nSpace are two novel visual analytic applications
that have been developed in collaboration with analysts to support
the investigation of large and complex datasets. nSpace is used for
triaging massive data and for analytical sense-making [12], [22],
and is currently undergoing experimental evaluation and pilot
deployment. GeoTime supports the visualization and analysis of
entities and events over time and geography [13] and is currently
in transition to deployment for analysts to use on a day-to-day
basis.
The epidemiology dataset was created by the authors’ for the
purposes of investigating the analytic process and evaluating
nSpace and GeoTime using an ecologically valid scenario. This
dataset is based on real news reports detailing the current outbreak
of avian flu. The analyst used for the evaluation was experienced
with both nSpace and GeoTime, but had no formal training in the
art of intelligence analysis.

1.1.2

Sandbox

The Sandbox is a flexible and expressive environment for
working with evidence and generating hypotheses. While concept
maps [11,15] and link analysis tools [10,19] aim to support similar
activates, their node-link representations can be limiting, and
readability and usability decrease as the volume of data increases.
The Sandbox supports both ad-hoc and more formal analytical
sense making though the use of fluid gestures for interaction.
Additionally, the Sandbox supports automated process model
templates, layers for managing multiple dimensions of data,
assertions with evidence templates, and scalability mechanisms to
support larger analytic tasks [22].
An evaluation of the Sandbox was conducted by the NIST
Visualization and Usability Group in 2005 [16]. Four analysts
participated in the experiment consisting of three hours of training
and eight hours of work on an intelligence analysis task. Results
indicated that the Sandbox enabled the analysts to work quickly
and efficiently, and perform a higher level of analysis when
compared to other tools.
1.2

GeoTime - Concurrent Temporal and Spatial Analysis

GeoTime improves perception and understanding of entity
movements, events, relationships, and interactions over time
within a geospatial context. As seen in Figure 2, events are
represented within an X,Y,T coordinate space, in which the X,Y
plane represents geographic space, and the T axis represents time.
In addition to providing spatial context, the ground plane marks
the instant of focus between past and future, meaning that events
along the timeline ‘occur’ when they meet the surface.
Several other visualization techniques for analyzing complex
event interactions only display information along a single
dimension, typically one of time, geography or network
connectivity.
An evaluation of GeoTime found that its unified geo-temporal
representation increased analysts’ understanding of entity
relationships and behaviors [13].

information systems, and time series analysis tools [1].

THE AVIAN FLU CASE STUDY

The avian flu case study presents several analytical challenges.
The dynamic nature of the data requires tools which support
temporal analysis, and enable the understanding of complex geospatial events. The objectives for the case study are listed in
Table 1. The role of the analyst will be played by Lynn, a
fictional analyst who is familiar with both nSpace and GeoTime,
but has no formal training in analysis, and can thus be considered
a novice user. The case study will provide a detailed examination
of the analytic process as Lynn uses nSpace and GeoTime to
fulfill the objectives of the exercise. The data used in this case
study is publicly available and consists entirely of internet sources
obtained through TRIST via the Google search engine. Key
references include the World Health Organization’s avian flu
disease outbreak news [21] and events timeline [20].

Thinking without Borders

Lynn has just received the assignment to analyze the distribution,
determinants, and potential impacts of the recent avian flu
outbreak. She begins by brainstorming in the Sandbox using her
prior and tacit knowledge to generate hypotheses about the
possible causes and effects of the recent outbreaks. She notes key
questions and outlines her analytical strategy for further
investigation. The fluid gestural interaction within the Sandbox
supports the early stages of analysis, which are often
unconstrained to enable the generation of new ideas and concepts.
Lynn simply points and clicks to create annotations. She draws
circles to create groups and draw links to connect related ideas.
Using these techniques, Lynn’s thoughts flow freely, and are
quickly organized with drag and drop and semi-automatic layout.
Emphasis can also be added to create visual structure. Alternative
scenarios are sketched out and the resulting empty assertions
become explicit reminders to find supporting and refuting
evidence, as shown in Figure 3.

continuous spatiotemporal representation.

Epidemiology Analysis

Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of
health and diseases, morbidity, injuries, disability and mortality in
populations [14]. In this context, an epidemiologist can be
thought of as a disease detective. Common tasks involved in
epidemiology include surveillance, outbreak investigation, control
measures, risk assessment, event characterization, and long term
impact research and the evaluation of interventions. Trend
analysis and change detection are also important in
epidemiological analysis. Changes can occur in disease
occurrence and distribution, in agent or host factors, or even in
health care practices. Typical analysis tools used in epidemiology

Acquiring Analytical Awareness

With several avenues to investigate, Lynn turns to TRIST where
she can follow a deductive process and find answers to questions,
as well as and evidence to evaluate each of her assertions and
hypotheses. As nSpace does not restrict the analyst to a specific
workflow, Lynn is able to adjust her analytic process based on her
current task. Rather that continue her analysis with pointed
queries, Lynn decides to use TRIST to immerse herself in the data
and favor a more inductive type of reasoning. Lynn’s goal is to
avoid or delay time investment in a particular scenario, which has
the potential of introducing analytic bias.
At this point, Lynn could point TRIST exclusively to the Health
Department internal database, but believes that could also
introduce some bias due to its narrow focus. At this early stage,
Lynn might miss some signs of new outbreaks or key contextual
cues available on the web. The web however poses a significant
challenge to the epidemiologist attempting to perform public
health surveillance. The signal to noise ratio is very high in this
particular case. The potential gravity of the avian flu threat and its
global reach generates a massive amount of information, in
constant flux, from sources of variable reliability. TRIST allows
her to evaluate the relevance and source credibility of thousands
of search results at a time, by revealing various attributes and
content without having to open and read results.
Lynn opts for this iterative analytical technique, rather than
relying only on reports sent to the Health Department. Starting
with general queries that she refines iteratively, Lynn uses the
TRIST launch queries pane, to examine documents from the web
using Google with the query “Bird flu”. Rather than overwhelm
Lynn with the several million query results, TRIST presents the
first 100 documents. Instead of starting with this result set, Lynn
decides to launch a few variations such as “Avian flu”, and
“H5N1 outbreaks”. Using TRIST’s difference visualization
capabilities, she can quickly compare and determine what is
unique or common within each result set without having to open a
single document. An example is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 5: Extracted entities can be used to browse results or help
determine relevance. Entities of interest are dragged to the
Sandbox where they stay linked to results containing that entity.

2.3

Discovering Trends and Themes

To establish the existence of an outbreak, categorized as a sudden
increase in the incidence of disease, Lynn performs a rough trend
analysis using the Country and Time dimensions in TRIST, which
automatically sort all query results into each dimension. Without
opening a search result, the categorization hints at various
observations that can be investigated further at a later time. For
example, Lynn notices that the disease was first identified in
Hong Kong in 1997 and that most human fatalities seem to have
occurred in Asia and in the Middle East. Considering a query
result as a unit of incidence, the length of each row in each
dimension bin reveals some trends. More observations are
available by selecting rows in one dimension and analyzing the
highlighted results in a different dimension, as shown in Figure 6.
For example, Lynn can focus on the evolution of the disease per
country or get a sense of the propagation of the disease over time.

Figure 4: TRIST difference visualization. Grey icons indicate
previously retrieved results, while white ones are new results.

Using this process, Lynn can close the feedback loop on the
query refinement process while increasing the precision and recall
of her information retrieval process.
Looking in the entities pane, as seen in Figure 5, Lynn
discovers that there seems to be a significant number of
documents on particular countries that are affected by avian flu.
She drags these entities into the sandbox and unrolls them into a
group so she can add information on the current situation in each
entity group later on. As she clicks on the entities in the sandbox,
all the documents that contain each entity become visible, and the
entity terms are highlighted in green.

Figure 6: Results from multiples queries are automatically
organized in any dimension of interest created by the analyst.
Selection-highlighting across dimensions reveals trends without
requiring the analyst to open a single document. In the Country
dimension, Nigeria results are selected in blue and those same
results are highlighted in the ‘2006’ bin of the Time dimension.

Lynn captures these quick observations, either as snippets,
whole documents, or sets of documents, in the Sandbox. She
notices that the World Heath Organization’s website was
recurring across TRIST’s country and time dimensions. This

29

indicates the availability of comprehensive data within a narrow
source, and on closer inspection, Lynn sees that it contains
spatiotemporal data of interest.
Before moving on to examine that spatiotemporal data, Lynn
opens the Automatic Categories dimension to see if any novel or
unexpected themes are detected in the data. The default generation
of three themes doesn’t show her anything new, so she asks for
four more categories to be generated. One of those, ‘animals’
seems potentially interesting, so she asks that it be further broken
down into four categories. The results come back as ‘chickens’,
‘turkeys’, ‘cats’ and ‘swans’ (Figure 7). Lynn is reminded that
while she tends to associate avian flu primarily with domesticated
birds (probably because of a large number of recent news stories
about that issue), it also affects wild birds, which could certainly
affect the chances of it being contained. She was also interested to
see cats detected as a theme in quite a few of the results, since she
hasn’t heard much about outbreaks in cats. She wonders how
much of an affect the disease is having on this non-avian,
mammalian population. She’ll keep these issues in mind as she
continues her analysis.

Figure 7: Themes contained within the results, located by and
displayed in the Automatic Categories dimension.

Having gained a better overview of the situation, as well as
some hypotheses regarding trends and issues, Lynn turns to
GeoTime to gain a different perspective on the scenario.
2.4

Disambiguating Spatial and Temporal Patterns

At the core of GeoTime is the concept of an event, which is
loosely based on Davidsonian semantics [2]. An event binds an
action or occurrence to a location, a time, and the entity or target
involved. It links the what, the where, the when, and the who to a
single entity. Each event can have a description or type, a
location, and a temporal context.
Lynn structures the avian flu data within GeoTime as follows:
(1) each event represents one or more human cases of disease
within a local area, labeled by age/sex of the victim and, in the
case of a multi-victim outbreak, the number of people infected, (2)
each event is associated with the strain of avian flu involved and
those strains are the ’targets‘ in this scenario, and (3) other
potentially relevant information, such as method of exposure, is
saved with each event. To import the data into GeoTime, an
Excel plug-in is used which translates tabular data into places,
events, and targets in GeoTime.
When working with data sets in which the targets represent
actual moving entities, such as vehicles, shipments, or in this case,
a strain of flu, the target trail represents the targets movement, and
depending on the accuracy and granularity of the data, can be
fairly accurate and used for analysis.
In this case, each target represents a disease strain, which we
know can exist in multiple discrete populations at the same time

30

and move in more than one direction at once. Rapid movements of
this target are therefore indicative of simultaneous and widespread
occurrences in an area encompassed by the visible target trails.
These trails thus provide an idea of the magnitude of global
disease activity for a particular strain. Removing the trails from
view gives the analyst a view only of individual disease events.
With the dataset imported into GeoTime, geo-spatial and
temporal patterns are immediately evident, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Initial view of the data, showing worldwide human cases
of avian flu. Sporadic localized activity seen in Asia until 2003 (1).
H5N1 cases increased in frequency in 2004 (2) with the bulk of
disease activity in Asia. Isolated incidents of strain H7N7 found in
Canada and Europe (3).

Geographically, the bulk of disease activity is clustered in
Asia, with some occurrences in the Middle East and a few in
Northern Europe and Western Canada. Temporally, disease
activity appears sporadic between 1997 and 2003. Target trails,
one per strain, indicate substantial increases in disease activity in
2004, continuing through the end of the dataset in early 2006. A
particular strain, H5N1, is clearly predominant, and is present in
Asia and the Middle East. Africa has no reported cases of avian
flu, while Europe and the Western Hemisphere appear to have
each had a brief and isolated incident with a strain not seen
elsewhere.
Using GeoTime, Lynn develops hypotheses about why disease
events and patterns occur. These hypotheses require further
investigation to assert or refute their validity, but the generation of
these hypotheses is necessary in understanding the spread of
disease on a global scale.
Since Asia is a hotspot for disease activity, Lynn decides to
investigate this region more closely, as seen in Figure 9. Lynn
notices that the concentration of three different strains, shown as
three distinct colors, in this geographic area is apparent, which
may imply that mutations have taken place within this region.
Figure 9 also reveals that disease events in Asia seem to occur in
clusters by location, with time gaps in between outbreaks. The
absence of the disease from nearby countries like Laos and Korea
are also interesting observations. Indonesia is not connected to
mainland Asia, yet somehow disease events later occur there,
suggesting avian flu was somehow brought over from the
mainland, perhaps due to bird migration or poultry exports. Lynn

quickly creates new assertions in the Sandbox to capture these
thoughts and drags a thumbnail of this GeoTime view to place
next to them so that she can quickly jump back to it from the
Sandbox in the future, as seen in Figure 10. Clicking on a
GeoTime thumbnail in the Sandbox invokes that context in
GeoTime.

on other groups. Groups can also be moved with collision
detection active and will then knock other groups out of the way
when the group is placed. Editor gestures insert and delete
Sandbox space by animating objects out of the way or bringing
them closer together.
As Lynn moves between information retrieval and analysis, a
diagram of the situation and assessment begins to emerge, as
shown in Figure 11 with details in Figure 12.

STRUCTURING AND CATALOGUING DATA

As Lynn finds relevant information in TRIST and GeoTime, she
integrates it with her existing hypotheses in the Sandbox. As the
Sandbox does not force the analyst into a particular model or
mode for the layout of their thoughts and evidence, Lynn is free to
arrange information as she sees to encode meaning. For example,
she places supporting details with higher level concepts, while
related issues are placed next to each other. She emphasizes items
more important to her by increasing their relative size. All these
sense making interactions are achieved through direct
manipulation using gestures. Drawing a circle around objects
selects them for moving. Drawing a second circle around selected
objects groups them. Items or groups can be moved and dropped

Figure 12: Analysis diagram in detail

While Lynn collects various types of information pertinent to
her analysis, she notices a general hypothesis among experts that
the virus might be spread by migrating birds. Lynn makes a group
in the sandbox and saves all the relevant links in this subject into
the group so she can come back to the topic in the future, as seen
in Figure 13.

3.1

Exploring Alternative Perspectives

Analytical models that encapsulate expert knowledge and best
practices can be quickly applied and un-applied to a situation to
provide an alternative point-of-view. To reduce the cognitive
biases associated with a particular mindset, exploring different
perspectives is key to successful analysis of a scenario. Trying to
fit the collected evidence to different models might reveal gaps or
different interpretations of the evidence. Lynn takes advantage of
her colleague's knowledge captured in a model he created during
his investigation of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. The cycle of
poverty and hunger applied to her assertion about the threat of the
disease propagating faster once in Africa provides new insight,
which suggests that impoverished people often live in close
proximity to poultry, and are unwilling to kill their livestock due
to their reliance on them for food and income. Another model,
which structures evidence as a process diagram, highlights the fact
that as long as the virus does not propagate between humans the
risks are low. These steps are highlighted in Figure 15.

Generating and Testing Hypothesis

Lynn uses assertions to keep track of the arguments for and
against the proposed measures to control the propagation of the
disease. Assertions have evidence gates that encode the object
dragged in as supporting or refuting evidence in a single gesture,
as shown in Figure 14. Assertions can also be nested to create
inference networks. An at-a-glance indicator on top of each
assertion provides quick assessment of the quantity and type of
evidence retrieved so far.

Step 1. Exploration workspace, in this case an assertion.

Step 2. Process Template on the Stages of Pandemic Influenza.

Figure 14: An Assertion with Evidence Gates. As the analyst drags
evidence through the left refuting gate of an assertion, the gate
flashes red, the evidence is tagged with a minus sign and the red
visual indicator on top of the assertion grows. A corresponding
supporting gate, on the right side, flashes green, adds a plus sign
and updates the green bar of the assertion score when used.

The explicit visual thinking supported by the Sandbox helps
counter natural human tendencies to only look for evidence that
supports the hypothesis. These tendencies highlight evidence
which sounds more plausible in the analyst’s mind or the
cognitive bias. This has the negative effect of giving more
strength to certain arguments based on how recently they were
processed. Assertions can be combined into an analysis of
competing hypotheses (ACH) framework [9]. Visual cues indicate
diagnosticity of the ACH evidence. An evidence item used in
many alternatives is blurred while an item uniquely supporting
one alternative hypothesis has a sharp icon.

32

Step 3. Applying the Pandemic template automatically placed the evidence
from the exploration workspace in this new perspective.
Figure 15: Using analytical templates for alternative perspectives.

3.3

Filling in Gaps

Zooming out to review her overall analytic progress, Lynn
realizes that her assertion regarding the disease being propagated
by the migrating birds is under-developed. She decides to
investigate migration routes in GeoTime as a possible cause of
disease transmission. Lynn augments her original GeoTime view
with additional information animal migratory routes, and color
codes events by outbreak type. She organizes each animal type in
a layer so that the events associated with each type of animal can
be easily toggled on or off. Lynn focuses her analysis on the most
widespread strain of avian flu, H5N1, which was localized to the
eastern hemisphere. She adjusts the visualization configuration to
include human and bird cases only, as shown in Figure 16.
It becomes visually apparent that the reported migratory and
wild bird cases do not frequently coincide with farmed bird or
human cases. This analysis lends credibility to the hypothesis that

migratory birds have not been a significant factor in the spread of
the disease. She annotates and drags this view in the
corresponding assertion in the Sandbox, entering through the left
gate, which tags the observation as refuting evidence and
recalculates the overall strength of this assertion, all in one simple
gesture.

from mainland Asia. The European and Middle Eastern outbreaks
appear within the Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway, and disease
could be spreading due to this migration route. The overlap of the
zones display a possibility that the H5N1 could spread to different
flyways, although the distribution of events, as seen in GeoTime,
suggest this has not happened yet. A single bird outbreak in India
is the only outlier, existing in a flyway otherwise unaffected by
H5N1. Investigation of the source of the Indian outbreak is
therefore of interest to Lynn.
Unlike Figure 16, Figure 17 provides strong evidence linking
bird migration to the distribution of H5N1. Examining the
temporal dimension, Lynn can see that the disease was restricted
to the core of the migration routes, until more recently, when
disease events occur in regions overlapping with other migration
routes. H5N1 has just begun to enter into these previously
untouched routes, and may therefore spread within the new routes
in the coming season as a result of spring migration. Monitoring
of wild and migratory birds along these routes in the future would
be advisable. More careful examination of the East
Asian/Australian flyway reveals that this route covers an area of
Alaska. This provides a way for H5N1 to enter into North
America, as shown in Figure 18.

Figure 16: H5N1 outbreaks colored by outbreak type.

However, Lynn notes that wild bird testing is a relatively recent
procedure, which suggests that true wild and migratory bird
infections may be far greater than reported. Since it has already
been established that avian flu occurs naturally in certain
waterfowl, she decides to further evaluate the role of migratory
birds by overlaying migration routes in the existing visualization..
She quickly finds open source information on migration routes
using TRIST and uses inking functionality in GeoTime to sketch
these routes in the same context as the event data, as seen in
Figure 17.

Figure 18: Migration route linking Asia with North America.

Since Alaska is socially isolated from the core North American
population, and from poultry trade, an Alaskan H5N1 outbreak
which precedes any other North American outbreak would be
strong evidence that H5N1 is spreading via bird migration. The
results of this analysis might effectively be used to persuade
Alaskan authorities to conduct sentinel surveillance of wild birds
to monitor for the presence of the virus. The United States Fish
and Wildlife Service already have a strong presence in Alaska,
and their services can be requested to conduct periodic testing of
wild birds. Lynn decides to also setup a monitoring query in
TRIST to keep an eye on Alaska.
At this stage of the analysis process, Lynn feels that her
assessment is clear enough to invite her colleagues to review it.
Since the work and the results are readily accessible in their visual
form, the presentation yields productive results by affording
complimentary feedback.
Lynn’s final report does not require very much attention until
the last minute since she knows it can quickly be generated by
moving selected elements from the Sandbox to MS Word or
PowerPoint, which also automatically formats the document and
generates appropriate references. Lynn may also use the Sandbox
itself to create an interactive final report.

eastern hemisphere.

The resulting view in GeoTime reveals two distinct outbreak
regions, each constrained within a migration route. The hotspot
events of Figure 9 are entirely contained within the bounds of the
East/Asian Australian flyway. This may also provide an
explanation of how H5N1 reached Indonesia, an area isolated

DISCUSSION

This case study is an attempt to investigate and validate
approaches to visual analytics that support the analysis of
complex, real-world scenarios. Our aim in conducting this case
study is to gain a deeper understanding of the analytic process,
and how our tools support this process, so that future tools may
benefit from the insights generated through our study.
It is clear from the results of the case study that visual analytic
tools that aim to support an analytic workflow must be flexible in
order to enable the freeform representations of thoughts,
hypotheses, and unstructured data. Providing the analyst with a

33

flexible workspace enables the free-thinking necessary for
effective analysis.
It is also important that these tools support uncertainty and
ambiguity, as often there is no single correct answer or
interpretation of evidence. Furthermore, we believe that it is
beneficial for the analyst to observe and understand uncertainty
within the context of hypotheses and findings, thus enabling quick
interpretation in order to make reliable assessments.
Finally, we believe that visual analytic tools should enable
quick and easy export to existing applications, such as MS Word
and PowerPoint, in order to fit within existing analytic workflows
and make the process of generating a report or presentation
seamless.

FUTURE WORK

In the future, we plan on examining how data can be more
seamlessly transferred from one analytic environment to another.
A difficult problem involves transforming unstructured data
accumulated in a freeform environment, such as nSpace, to a more
structured environment, such as GeoTime. We are currently
investigating mixed-initiative techniques for semi-automated
event extraction, along with other techniques to facilitate fluid
data transfer.
Future work also includes building on the best of nSpace as a
unified analyst environment and as an open integration platform
to implement a distributed infrastructure in which analytic
components can interoperate and provide capabilities to each
other as well as to applications for analysts. One example of
ongoing work in this area is an effort to integrate components that
will support analysts that work with information in multiple
languages.

CONCLUSIONS
[17]

This case study illustrates how nSpace and GeoTime can be
combined to create a powerful analytic setting that supports the
analysis of complex, real-world scenarios. While the synergy
created though the integration of these tools enabled Lynn to
quickly understand the scenario, generate meaningful hypotheses,
and present her results, there remain several avenues for
improvement, specifically the transfer of data between different
analytic environments. Nevertheless, the benefits of analytic tool
integration cannot be contested, and based on the results of this
case study, we believe that supporting a fluid, non-sequential
workflow will lead to performance benefits for the analyst.
