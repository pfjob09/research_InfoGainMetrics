methods. Besides, the probability of occurrence of CT
numbers is utilized to calculate the Entropy feature. For
lung lesions ranging from normal, AAH, BAC, and
adenocarcinoma, their histopathology contents are
definitely getting more and more complex and the
complexity are evidently reflected in the CT densities.
The Entropy feature efficiently describes the raging of
lesion. Through the multinomial logistic regression
model, the correlation between the computerized features
and the pathologic results is regressed to construct a
computer aided classification system.

Abstract
Low dose CT (LDCT) is imperative in pursuing
early detection of lung cancer. From October 2008 to
September 2010, 25 patients with 31 nodules were found
in the health examination and underwent surgical
operations at China Medical University Hospital . Of
which, the lesions is classified into atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia (AAH), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma
(BAC), malignant, or benign other than AAH in the
pathologic results. In this study, objective and
standardized features were defined based on the CT
number analysis in order to describe lesions and
construct a computer aided diagnosis system. The
diagnostic performance of constructed system is 70.97%
in the accuracy index.

2. Materials and Methods
From October 2008 to December 2010, 25 patients
underwent low-dose thin-section CT examinations for
lung cancer screening in the Health Evaluation Center of
China Medical University Hospital and underwent
surgical operations due to the high malignancy.
Examinations were voluntary and at each individual’s
own expense. Before the examinations, the chest X-rays
of all patients were normal and without suspicious
findings. Of these, 31 lesions were performed wedge
resection or lobectomy and examined pathologically. The
number of the lesions per patient was one in 21 patients,
two in 2 patients, and three in 2 patients. Of the patients
with two lesions are both female, one is all diagnosed as
benign other than AAH and the other is all diagnosed as
AAH. One of the patients with 3 lesions is female and
the lesions were diagnosed as AAH, BAC and malignant
respectively. The other male patient was all diagnosed as
benign other than AAH. The pathological diagnosis in all
patients was benign other than AAH in 7 lesion, AAH in
5 lesions, BAC in 6 lesions, and malignant in 13 lesions.
All CT images without IV contrast medium were
included in this study and the patient characteristics were
listed in Table I.
Exanimations of pulmonary nodules were performed
using a 64 rows detector CT scanner (64-row MDCT
scanner, Light Speed VCT, GE Healthcare, Waukesha,
WI, USA). The screening protocols were as follows:
detector collimation is 0.625 mm; section thickness is
0.625 mm; pitch is 1.375; rotation time between 0.4 and
0.8 second; tube voltage is 120 kVp; and tube current

1. Introduction
Early detection of lung cancer remains the most
important rule to improve outcome. With advancing
technology in computed tomography (CT), it has become
possible to screen early lung cancer that has been
addressed by several study groups such as NELSON trial
[1] . The most frustrating problem encountered is how to
manage lesions detected from screening. To determine
the nature of a lesion by analyzing image information is
thus an important field to be studied.
Tumor disappearance ratio (TDR) is a simple and
useful density feature is clinical diagnosis [2] [3] . The
underlying concept is that the percentage of
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) component in a
lesion reflects the likelihood of malignancy [4] . The
TDR feature is evaluated by comparing the maximum
diameter or the approximate lesion area, maximum
diameter multiplies perpendicular diameter, in the lung
windows and mediastinal windows and has been reported
to correlate with clinical histopathology [5] . In essence,
TDR feature depicts a tumor density in dichotomous
manner, which does not fully elaborate the density
information of a tumor that may limit its diagnostic value.
In this study, the TDR feature is quantified and the
CT numbers of a lesion are described by statistic

between 20 and 50 mA. IV contrast medium was not
used in the exanimations.
The CT image sequence is browsed in the axial view
and specified a rectangular area as the region of interest
(ROI) that included the suspicious nodule (Fig. 1). The
segmentation of suspicious nodule was performed using
the threshold and the grouping methods. An optimal
threshold is calculated by the Otsu's algorithm [6]
according to all CT numbers in the defined ROI and
utilized to partition the ROI into objects and background
(lung tissue). While the formed object is unsuitable, the
elimination of normal structure around the suspicious
nodule, such as vessels and bronchi, or the segmentation
of pleural tag are performed using a semi-automatic
method. A partition line is manually defined and then
utilized to partition an object into several objects.
Therefore, the lesion is identified and described by the
proposed computerized features.
CT images were photographed with a window center
of -600 Hounsfield Units (HUs) and window width of
1600 HU for lung windows and a window center of 35
HU and width of 350 HU for mediastinal windows. The
pixels in the CT image with CT numbers between -1400
HU and -140 HU are appearance in the lung windows
but disappear in the mediastinal windows. Therefore,
each lesion is partitioned into two areas appearance and
disappearance according to the cut point -140 HU.
The computerized TDR feature between lung
windows and mediastinal windows was measured on the
identified lesion AreaL (Fig. 2). The pixels with CT
numbers less than -140 HU are defined as disappearance
area AreaDA. Therefore, the TDR feature on the lesion
area is defined as

Besides, the perimeter (PerL), maximum diameter
(MDL), and perpendicular diameter (PDL) of identified
lesion are also useful for evaluating the TDR feature. The
pixels, named as remaining area, in the identified lesion
and with CT number not less than -140 HU are visible in
the mediastinal windows. Similarly, the perimeter
(PerRA), maximum diameter (MDRA), and perpendicular
diameter (PDRA) of remaining area are calculated. The
TDR features are measured on perimeter, maximum

In the table, Benign indicates the lesion is diagnosed as benign other than AAH and the gray cell represents the
difference was not statistically significant.

approximating area, lesion area and perimeter could be
accurately calculated and is used to assess the TDR
features in this study. For any pair of TDR features, the
similarity between them was measured through the
Pearson correlation. All similarities on each pair of the
TDR features were statistically significant positive
correlation and the pair with the minimal similarity is
TDRArea and TDRPerimeter r = 0.908 and p < 0.001. The
effect size of r = 0.908 is considered very large and
indicates very highly similarity between any of two TDR
features.
The histograms of feature TDRArea shows the tumor
disappearance ratios in the four pathology groups (Fig. 3).
Clearly, the lesions which were classified into the AAH
and BAC groups are entirely disappearance in the
mediastinal window of CT images. The disappearance
ratios of benign other than AAH lesions is relatively
lower than that of the AAH and the BAC lesions in
addition to an interstitial fibrosis lesion (6.3 * 5.4 mm).
However, the disappearance ratio of malignant lesions is
variety.
The one-way ANOVA was conducted to assess
whether the differences between four pathology groups
were significant for each of TDR features and each of
density features and the results were listed in Table II.
For each of TDR and of density features, the difference
among the pathology groups was statistically significant
(p < 0.001). Post hoc analysis, evaluated by Scheffe and
LSD method, is further utilized to examine the abilities
of the TDR features and the density features in
distinguishing between each pair of pathologic groups.
Clearly, the differences between benign other than AAH
and malignant lesions and between AAH and BAC
lesions were not statistically significant in addition to the
Entropy feature. The Entropy feature in differentiating
these two pairs of the pathologic groups approaches
statistically significant but was not significant between
benign other than AAH and BAC groups.

In statistics, the measures of central tendency of a
set of numerical data is described by the center of
location, such as mean, median and the dispersion of
numerical data is measured by standard deviation. In this
study, the features, Mean, Median, and StdDev (standard
deviation) are employed to describe the distribution of
CT numbers in the identified lesion. Furthermore, the
density of identified lesion could be estimated by the
probability density function. Due to probabilities of
occurrence in some CT numbers are very low, the
continuous CT number are partitioned into several
discrete intervals (bins) and the frequency of the CT
numbers in the bin is calculated. While the width of
interval is set to one, the probability of occurrence of
each CT number is directly used in evaluation. The
feature Entropy is defined as
Entropy = ∑All Bins P(Bin(x))Log2P(Bin(x))

(5)

where x is the index of bin and P(Bin(x)) indicates the
probability of occurrence of Bin(x).

3. Results
According to the analysis results of ANOVA, the
differences between four pathological groups were not
statistically significant in either patient's age or
maximum diameter of lesion (p=0.320 and p=0.056,
respectively). The differences in the maximum diameter
of lesion between AAH and malignant groups and
between BAC and malignant groups were significant,
p=0.016 and p=0.045 respectively, evaluated by
Student's t-test but the differences in the other pairs of
pathological groups were not significant.
In the previous researches, the TDR features of a
lesion was separately evaluated according to the
maximum diameter or the approximating area assessed
by the maximum diameter multiplies the perpendicular
diameter. In addition to the maximum diameter and the

Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to
assess whether the TDR features and the density features
significantly predicted the pathologic result of a lesion.
When all TDR and density features are considered
together, over-fitting problem occurred in the constructed
prediction model. Therefore, finding proper features
which significantly contributed to predict the pathologic
groups is necessary. Three features, TDRPerimeter, Mean,
and Entropy were selected by the forward stepwise
method and utilized to construct a computer aided
classification model. The validation of constructed
classification model was verified by leave-one-out crossvalidation in which each lesion is classified by the model
derived from all lesions other than that lesion. The
classification results are summarized in the Table III.
The accuracy of constructed classification model is
70.97%.

Conclusions

References

To correctly diagnose a lung tumor using noninvasive method remains a critical issue to be solved.
This study is the first work aimed on tumor’s CT density
using its comprehensive features to evaluate their
diagnostic performance in low-dose thin section CT
imaging and successfully construct a computer-aided
prediction model to diagnose histopathology of lung
tumors.
Low-dose CT (LDCT) is imperative in pursuing
early detection of lung cancer. Density information is
absolutely sensitive to CT dose index volume and slice
thickness, and high noise signal tend to develop at low
dose CT imaging. It remained controversial whether the
density information was still effective in LDCT to
classify lung tumors. In our results, the TDR and density
features are effective to construct a computer aided
diagnosis system for providing an auxiliary information
to help the physician's diagnosis.
