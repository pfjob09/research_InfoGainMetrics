Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).

Abstract
This paper describes the testing analysis
that has been done towards a prototype of virtual
museum named ViSeum. The prototype was
based on the real Kedah State Museum (KSM) at
Northern Malaysia. This ViSeum was developed
using non immersive virtual reality technique,
whereas it focused to reduce cost development
and maintenance, easy access and more
interactive. The objective of this study is to
present the result of the analysis based using
Technology Acceptance Model on the survey.
Perceived usefulness, perceive ease of use, and
perceived enjoyment are the independent
variables in testing intention to use by visitor.
Keywords: Virtual

2. Problem Statement
As reviewed, until the present, there is a
limited amount of research being done in virtual
museum development and usability testing for
the system, especially in Malaysia. As an
example, a virtual tour of Sarawak focused on
panoramic tours, where the virtual heritage of
Malacca was based on a full-immersion
environment. For this research, the researcher is
trying to develop ViSeum non-immersive and
three
dimension
(3D)
walkthrough
characteristics in the environment to study their
potential.
Today, each prototype or system developed
needs to test its usability to ensure that it is easy
enough for users to interact with. This study
focused on TAM since TAM has shown that it
has successfully tested the usability of the
systems [2], [3], [9], [11], [14], [19], [20], [30]
[34] and was used by most of the researchers
[10], [18], [28], [36]. This paper studies the
acceptance and the intention to use from visitors
using TAM.

1. Introduction
Museum has the potential to become a
powerful tourism product because of the
uniqueness of its arts and cultures. Museums are
the most suitable institution for cultural
promotion because of the culture, arts, history
and artistic activities [16]. According to Datuk
Dr. Mohamed Arif Nun, Chef Executive of
Multimedia Development Centre (MDC) (1999),
learning histories do is not just to remember
dates and events but also to look at ourselves and
what has happened to our grandparents [12].
However, 74.1% of museum visitors want
to see interactive exhibitions, although there are
still many museums using traditional techniques
in their exhibition [16]. Virtual museum is an
alternative to gives user experience interact with
the virtual environment. The development of
Kedah State Museum’s (KSM) Virtual Museum

3. Virtual Museum
Virtual museums were constructed with the
most advanced technology of the day in an effort
to reconstruct the past, disseminate ideas, or
demonstrate new ideas in a way the observer
would feel they are actually taking part in the
real thing, or push the observer closer to the
actual experience [21]. Virtual reality (VR)
offers an exciting new cost-effective way to
generate excitement for the museum and its
158

exhibits, and increase guest participation.
Additionally, guests could learn more about an
exhibit than they have ever dreamed.
This research is trying to bring down some
“walls” of fear of loss of control on the museum
end, and has opened up some new ways of
thinking of reaching new audiences, as well as
increasing the knowledge base on art, not just
from inside the museum, but also for scholars on
the outside. The museum is allowing end users to
walkthrough its images; to ‘create’ virtual
exhibitions, and to enjoy works of art on their
own time, and in their own places – named
ViSeum.

Othman [5], Dillon and Morris [8], and Sun and
Zhang [28] stated that TAM is seen as a good
parsimonious model to predict and measure user
technology acceptance. From Sun and Zhang’s
[28] review it was found that TAM mainly
focuses on individual perception at the level of
individual actions even though prior research
mainly focused on the mix of level of analysis.
For these reasons, the researcher decided to test
Virtual exhibition using the TAM model.
The TAM is one of the more widely
accepted theoretical frameworks that has been
used to measure system acceptance. Several
researchers have consequently authenticated
TAM using a number of diverse applications
including primarily e-mail, voice mail, word
processing, and spreadsheets [14]. TAM has
been applied to give explanation about diffusion
by means of user-perception measures as well as
actual usage measures.
There are four common TAM variables will
discussed in this paper, namely Perceived
Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU)
and Perceived Enjoyment (PE) and Behavioural
Intention (BI) as a dependent variable as discuss
below.

Figure 1 ViSeum prototype

4.1 Behavioral Intention
Ajzen and Fishbein, [1] pointed out that for
Behavioral Intention (BI) to be a predictor of use
the measure of acceptance to use computer. Use
of the new technology of ViSeum is basically to
validate whether the system will be accepted or
rejected by customers. However, questions
should be raised as to whether behavioural
intention is appropriate in the context of virtual
environment applications. Using VR as a tool in
conveying historical information is basically a
transaction process between visiting real
exhibitions to a new approach of visiting; a
virtual exhibition where users have more chances
to visit the museum without needing to go to the
real exhibition. Users might also walk about and
look at exhibitions. Research has consistently
shown that BI is the strongest predictor of actual
use [6], [10], [30], [32].

The creation of 3D museums is the next
logical step in museum presentation. Referring to
Jones and Christal [13] and Samah [27], “the
next generation of 3D technology in museums is
now possible and affordable”. Users can easily
access the cultural heritage stored in museums
around the world and search and access virtual
museums information as the contents of single
federated museums [29]. Virtual museum can be
used as a reference version and allows the access
of fragile, closed, destroyed, stolen or remote
sites [23]. To complement traditional museums,
interactive 3D virtual museums offer museums
the opportunity of presenting rich virtual
exhibitions, which contain accurate or high
fidelity 3D digital models of objects together
with layers of information.

4.2 Perceived Usefulness

4. Technology Acceptance Model

Perceived usefulness (PU) is defined as “the
degree to which a person believes that using the
particular system would enhance his or her job
performance [5].” This follows from the
definition of the word useful: capable of being
used advantageously. TAM posits that PU is a

TAM is an information systems theory that
models how users come to accept and use a
technology. TAM and SUMI are of special
interest because they will be applied in the
usability attribute reference model and
preference test [15]. Awang, Yaakub and
159

significant factor effecting acceptance of an
information system.
Based on a review of acceptance and
innovation studies, it emphasizes the relative
importance of usefulness towards technology
acceptance and usage [20], [26], [33], [35]. For
PU, we notice that items fall into three main
clusters. The first cluster relates to job
effectiveness, the second to productivity and
time savings, and the third to the importance of
the system to one’s job. And here, the main
elements in the questionnaire that was developed
are time saving, enhanced comprehension and
interest. These elements were based on the TAM
model that was developed by Davis [5].

correlational and regression study to identify the
importance factors associates with the variables
interest. In addition, hypotheses testing were
undertaken to explain the variance in the
dependent variable to predict technology usage.
The population for this study is visitors of
KSM and the design used for this sampling is
simple random sampling. Hence, 404 visitors are
used as a real test and this is from a total of 456
visitors who answered the questionnaire.

5.1 Correlation Analysis
The correlation coefficient (r) indicates the
strength of the association between two metric
variables. Spearmen-product-moment correlation
is used to describe this relationship.
Table 1 gives a summary frequency table of
the correlation comprising the intention matrices
for usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment.
ViSeum usage correlated 0.70 for usefulness,
0.61 for ease of use and 0.67 for enjoyment. The
overall usefulness-intention was significantly
greater than the ease of use-intention and
enjoyment-intention and has a positive
relationship toward intention. All correlation
variables indicated a positive relationship with
each other and significant at a 0.01 level.

4.3 Perceived Ease of Use
Perceived usefulness is defined here as “the
degree to which a person believes that using a
particular system would be free of effort [5].”
This follows from the definition of the word
useful: freedom from difficulty or great effort.
Kwon and Chidambaram [17] used and tested
the TAM model to examine patterns of cellular
phone adoption and usage in an urban setting.
The results of the study confirm that users’
perceptions and especially perceived ease of use
(PEU) are significantly associated with the
motivation to use cellular phones. According to
Ramayah and Ignatius [25] and Venkatesh [32]
perceived ease of use has been generally
recognised as a key factor increasing acceptance
and utilisation of a technology.

4.4 Perceived Enjoyment
Igbaria et al. [11] define perceived
enjoyment as the degree to which using the
technology is fun or pleasant for an individual.
Definitions of perceived fun and perceived
playfulness are quite similar to the concept of PE
[24]. Overall, they concluded that individuals
accept technology because its use is beneficial
and great. Most people cannot withstand
boredom. Perceived enjoyment has a greater
effect on intentions if perceived usefulness is
high (and vice versa) [7].

5.2 Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is used to support
results of correlation as discussed before. It was
applied to examine the effect of two factors that
affect behavioural intention on user perceived.
The main reason for employing this technique is
to determine the minimum number of a set of
variables which the most strongly related to the
dependent variable explained by these variables.
Table 2 shows all of independent variables
explain for almost 62% of the variance in the
perceived factors. By analysing the magnitude of
coefficient, the variable that has the largest value
of standardised beta coefficient would posses the
largest variation or effect on the dependent
variable. As considered to the variables in table
above, perceived usefulness is observed to have

determine the effects of perceived usefulness,
ease of use and enjoyment towards new
technology usage. This study is classified as a

the largest effect with a standardised beta of 0.4
as compared to the degree of perceived
enjoyment and perceived ease of use with the
standardised beta only at 0.3 and 0.2. Thus, H1,
H2 and H3 were significantly explained the
variance is supported by the result.
The regression analysis shows that all of
the variables had a positive relationship and were
supported. This implies that customers accepted
the ease of use, usefulness and enjoyment as
factors to use ViSeum.

PE was the second statistically significant
determinant in this model. Other studies have
found controversial findings of the role of
enjoyment on acceptance. While Davies et al.
[7], Igbaria et al. [11], Heijden [10] Pikkarainen
et al. [24] and Teo, Lim and Lai [31] have
noticed that PE significantly affects intention to
use computers, Igbaria et al. [11] found that
enjoyment has no statistically significant
correlation with the acceptance of data
processing systems. The positive relation
between perceived enjoyment and intention to
use ViSeum goes to show that users will only
use ViSeum if they find it enjoyable to visit
virtually.

6. Discussion
Among the objectives of the research,
customer acceptance of ViSeum was studied in
the light of the TAM. This model was proposed
that ViSeum acceptance could be modelled with
the variables derived from the TAM.
From the descriptive statistics, this study
demonstrates the main values of perceived
usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived
enjoyment are 4.25, 3.98 and 4.24 respectively.
Based on a 5-point Likert Scale, the readings are
above the medium scale.
The results of the regression coefficient
analysis conducted on the three factors indicated
that PU was found to be the most influential
factor in explaining the intention to use ViSeum
by individual customers of the Museum. This
was supported by several studies, Davis [5],
Dolen and Ruyter [9], Karjaluoto and Pahnila
[24], Ramayah and Jantan [26], and Venkatesh
[32], who found that PU had a strong regression

7. Conclusion
This finding is in line with other TAM
studies [5], [24] which found that PEU has less
relationship with technology acceptance than
PU. This suggests that BI impinges on
acceptance through PU and PE.
For future work, more research regarding
used of virtual reality in others public museums
in Malaysia can be carried out.
