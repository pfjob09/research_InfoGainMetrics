Abstract
The sea surface temperature (SST) data availability
by infrared measurement was low compared to
microwave measurement. The infrared radiation cannot
penetrate the cloud, so their availabilities are severely
limited by clouds. The microwave can penetrate the
clouds and give accurate SST measurements under
clouds. The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) derived
SST data has an RMS error of 0.6-0.7 K. TMI is a
microwave radiometer onboard the Tropical Rainfall
Measurement Mission (TRMM) Satellite. The infrared
derived SST data has low data availability but has higher
spatial resolution compared to microwave derived data.
The spatial resolution of infrared radiometer, Moderateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is about
1km, but the spatial resolution of TMI is 25km. The
objective of our study is to increase the spatial resolution
of microwave derived SST data and increase the
availability of infrared derived SST data.
In this study, we used MODIS SST data with grid
size of about 0.01˚ and TMI SST data with grid size of
0.25˚. We re-sampled these data into the new map with
grid size of 0.1˚. We find the new merged SST data from
the MODIS SST and TMI SST. If any of the MODIS or
TMI SST data is available, then the merged SST was
assigned the value of the existing data. If both of the SST
data are available, then the new merged SST was given
the value of the average of these data. Otherwise, the
new SST data was determined by interpolation method.
We used the neighbourhood pixels for interpolation. All
of the processing steps were programmed in MATLAB
code. . However we checked our results by comparing
the SST data availability of TMI and MODIS images
before processing and data availability of new image
after processing.

cloud, so their availabilities are severely limited by
clouds (Lei Guan et.al., 2003).. The microwave can
penetrate the clouds and give accurate SST
measurements under clouds. The TRMM Microwave
Imager (TMI) derived SST data has an RMS error of 0.60.7 K (McClain, 1989). TMI is a microwave radiometer
onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission
(TRMM) Satellite. The infrared derived SST data has
low data availability but has higher spatial resolution
compared to microwave derived data. The spatial
resolution of infrared radiometer, Moderate-resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is about 1km, but
the spatial resolution of TMI is 25km. The objective of
our study is to increase the spatial resolution of
microwave derived SST data and increase the availability
of infrared derived SST data.
In this study, we used MODIS SST data with
grid size of about 0.01˚ and TMI SST data with grid size
of 0.25˚. We re-sampled these data into the new map
with grid size of 0.1˚. We find the new merged SST data
from the MODIS SST and TMI SST. If any of the
MODIS or TMI SST data is available, then the merged
SST was assigned the value of the existing data. If both
of the SST data are available, then the new merged SST
was given the value of the average of these data.
Otherwise, the new SST data was determined by
interpolation method. We used the neighbourhood pixels
for interpolation. All of the processing steps were
programmed in MATLAB code.

2. Methodology
First of all, we download the MODIS SST data
from Terra Atmosphere Level 2 Product (MOD07_L2) at
LAADS Web (http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/), and
TMIS SST data from VS.4 TMI ocean products at RSS
homepage
(http://www.remss.com/about_rss/about_rss.html).
The TMI data covers the area from 180˚W to
180˚E and from 38˚S to 38˚N. The MODIS data covers
area from 5.266˚N to 26.178˚N and from 77.955E to
103.285˚E The TMI image was then orientation
corrected (Figure 2) and the area of subset was extracted
to the same coverage area of MODIS image (Figure 3).

Keywords--- SST, microwave, infrared, merging.

We then masked the clouds and tagged the land area. The
MODIS and TMI images were then geo-coded. The
image was also colour-coded. The green colour
represents the land mass. The red colour represents no
TMI observations. The yellow colour represents the TMI
observations containing bad data. The magenta colour
represents the missing SST data due to rain. The black
colour represents the sea with good TMI observations.
After that, we performed the geometrical correction on
the raw image of MODIS SST image (Figure 4). The
image after geometrical correction is shown in Figure 5.
Then we masked the MODIS SST image with the first
byte of MODIS Cloud Mask. The image was then colour
coded (Figure 6). The green colour represents the land
mass. The red colour represents no MODIS observations,
bad or cloud masking pixels. The blue colour represents
the sea with good MODIS observations.

The spatial resolution of MODIS image is about
1km or 0.01˚ per pixel. The spatial resolution of TMI
image is about 25 km or 0.25˚ per pixel. We re-sampled
the MODIS and TMI image to a new image with spatial
resolution of about 10 km or 0.1˚. After that, we merged
TMI image and MODIS image with new grid size
(Figure 7).

The MODIS SST data and TMI data were not
available.

After that, we did the colour-coding on the merged
image. We also did the interpolation for missing or bad
data. First of all we checked the value of SST data to
determine whether the SST data was available or not. If
the SST data was unavailable, then we checked the
neighbourhood pixel. If the neighbourhood SST data was
unavailable, we just left the SST data unchanged. If
neighbourhood data was available, we assigned the
pixels with the average of the SST data of
neighbourhood pixels. The new merged was colourceded (Figure 8). The green colour represents the land
mass. The red colour represents no TMI observations.
The yellow colour represents the TMI observations exist
but are bad or missing SST data due to rain. The blue
colour represents the sea with good TMI observations.

The MODIS had the lowest data availability
because the infrared radiation used in MODIS. The
infrared radiation could not penetrate the cloud, so the
SST data below the clouds could not be retrieved. The
TMI, a microwave radiometer had higher data
availability (43.28%) compared to MODIS (16.14%).
After merging the images and interpolation, the data
availability was increased to 72.79%.
The data availability was increased by merging;
however, the spatial resolution for MODIS was reduced
after merging. The spatial resolution of 10 km per pixel
was acceptable for application in SST data retrieval. The
SST data was stable in the range of 10 km.
The merging method combined both the
advantages of microwave and infrared data. The data of
MODIS missing due to cloud coverage could be replaced
by TMI data; while the pixels with no TMI observation
were replaced by the clear water pixels of MODIS. The
interpolation method estimated the data of masked pixels
by using the data of neighbourhood pixels. Therefore, the
new image after merging and interpolation had the
highest data availability.

4. Conclusions
The merging and interpolation methods
increased the SST data availability of microwave and
infrared data. Before processing, the SST data
availability of MODIS was 16.14% and the SST data
availability of TMI was 43.28%. After merging and
interpolation, the SST data availability was increased to
72.79%. The processing steps for creating new image
with new grid size, merged images, and estimated data

3. Result and Discussion
We calculated the SST data availability for MODIS
image, TMI image and the merged image. The SST data
availability was calculated by the formula:

computer program, MATLAB. The repetitive or some
changing on the processing steps was able to be
performed quickly and easily.
