Wavelets: A Tool for Efficient Data Representation

More often than not information is embedded in massive amount data corrupted with noise. Efficient
representation of data will facilitate processing of information contained in the data. Wavelets are a new
mathematical tool for data representation, and are particularly efficient in reducing the number of parameters in the
representation, a process known as data compression. This talk is a visual presentation of the applications of
wavelets, including image, video and other data compression as well as denoising and signal separation. Some
mathematical aspects of wavelets will also be presented.
