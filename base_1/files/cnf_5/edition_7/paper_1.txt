Abstract- The IEEE 802.11e standard extension for
medium access control protocol in wireless local area
networks enhances the existing IEEE 802.11 protocol speci­
fication towards support for quality of service and improved
spectrum management. We look in this paper specifically
into an 802.11e concept that is referred to as block
acknowledgment. Unlike the original 802.11, where ev­
ery frame reception must be acknowledged independently,
block acknowledgments offer the possibility to acknowledge
several consecutive data frames in one response. This
obviously may help to decrease the protocol overhead,
but is expected to introduce higher end-to end delays for
the data frame transmissions. We present a closed-form
analytical analysis of the block acknowledgment protocol,
and compare our findings to simulation results. Our results
show that whereas throughputs improve considerably when
block acknowledgments are applied, care has to be taken
not to increase the delays above unacceptable durations.

INTRODU CTION

The Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineering
(IEEE) standard 802.11 [1] dominates the market of
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) systems. High
data rates up to 54MI1s are introduced by 802.11a [2]
and 802.11g [3] at 5GHz respectively 2.4GHz. Due to
the static overhead included with every frame exchange
the efficiency of 802.11 decreases when using small data
frames and/or high data rates. Currently Task Group E
(TGe) of 802.11 establishes an addendum [4] to support
Quality of Service (QoS). The addendum includes the
Block Acknowledgment (BA) mechanism which helps to
reduce the protocol overhead. Several vendors are already
implementing BA in their products. Especially the market
of 802.11g systems is characterized by different "Turbo"
mode options. Out of many BA is most promising
even without implementing any other feature of 802.11e.
Hence the present paper focuses on the enhancements of
BA and gives simulative and analytical results.
A. Motivation

Studies [5]-[11] have independently shown that the
efficiency of 802.11 depends very much on the Physical
Layer (PHY) mode. With the usage of 802. lIb [12] and
especially the introduction of 802.11a [2] or 802.11g

Compared to a fragmentation burst, BA saves overhead. De­
pending on the number of MPDUs the BA overhead of BlockA CKReq
and BiockACK is negligible.

[3] several data rates are available in 802.11. Each of
these data rates (e.g. ranging from 6Ml1s to 54Ml1s for
the 802.11a PHY) uses the same signaling overhead.
Hence the efficiency of 802.11 drops at high data rates.
Therefore 802.11e introduces a new Acknowledgment
(ACK) scheme to reduce the overhead.
B. Outline

This paper is outlined as follows. First we explain
802.11e Block Acknowledgment (BA) in detail. Following
BA is analyzed. Based on simulations we evaluate the
BA mechanism and present our results. Our simulations
consider the 802.11a Physical Layer (PHY). Finally we
conclude and estimate the BA procedure. Throughout this
paper all mathematical notations and unit descriptions are
given according to [13]. See documents [14] and [15] of
the authors for an introduction to 802.11 and its Quality
of Service (QoS) supporting features of 802. lIe.

BLOCK A CKNOWLEDGM ENT IN 802.11E

To increase the efficiency Block Acknowledgment (BA)
aggregates several Acknowledgment (ACK) frames into
one frame. Therefore the BlockACK frame replaces
several single ACK frames. It consists of a bitmap of
128 B. This BlockACK bitmap indicates the status of
reception of up to 64 MAC Service Data Units (MSDUs).
Thus 2 B are used to indicate the successful reception
of an MSDU or fragments (MAC Protocol Data Unit
(MPDU) thereof. To allow a flexible implementation of
the BA procedure 802.11e defines immediate or delayed
BA. The latter one gives a receiver more time to do

computing on the received frames. Hence it allows a soft­
ware implementation of the 802.11e protocol (e. g. using
hardware driver).
Since in [4] the abbreviation "Block Ack" is used to
indicate the procedure itself as well as the corresponding
frame, confusion may easily occur. In the following text
we indicate the BA mechanism by the acronym BA.
"BlockACK" indicates the corresponding frame.
To use the BA mechanism the sender must initiate the
BA in the receiver by transmitting an "ADDBA" request
to the recipient. Afterwards the recipient responds to the
request by denying or accepting the usage of BA. It is
the receiver which indicates the buffer size that shall be
used. The number of buffers and the BA policy may be
changed at any time.
Having successfully set up a BA the initiator may use
the BA procedure limited by the following constraints
only:
•

•

•

All transmissions are limited by the Transmission
Opportunity (TXOP) duration. A BA frame ex­
change burst may not exceed this limit. However, a
BlockACK request may be demanded in subsequent
TXOPs to the current one.
The originator may not transmit more frames than
the receiver has indicated to be able to buffer.
To protect the frame burst the Request To
Send/Clear To Send (RTSICTS) mechanism shall
be used or the first frame in a BA TXOP shall
be acknowledged individually to allow a consistent
Network Allocation Vector (NAV ) in all neighboring
Stations (STAs).

A BA may only start using a bitmap indicating an
MSDU boundary.
However, according to the intention of 802. lIe the orig­
inator may split frames using BA across several TXOPs,
see Fig. 3. Thus BA can be used as flexible as possible.
Fig. 1 presents a comparison of legacy 802.11 frame
bursting and BA.
Only when using the delayed BA feature the receiver
shall respond of an ordinary ACK frame instead by
a BlockACK. This indicates to the originator that the
receiver has successfully understood the end of the BA
transmission. A soon as the BA frames can be acknowl­
edged the receiving QoS Station (QSTA) will transmit the
BlockACK as its earliest frame with highest priority. In
contrast to the delayed BA the immediate BA procedures
avoids the need of a separated TXOP for the BlockACK
transmission, see Fig. 2.
After a recipient receives a BlockACKReq it shall
indicate to the higher layer all received frames of a
sequence number less than the number indicated in the
request frame. If the buffer is filled up while new MPDUs
are arriving the first successfully received MSDU shall
be indicated to the higher layer.
In addition to the immediate and delayed BA proce­
dure the "No ACK" procedure may be used as well.
Accordingly 802.11e requires a starting frame exchange
to allow NAV setting in all neighboring STAs. Since this
scheme cannot guarantee any reliability of transmission
it may be suited best for User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
packets as an example.

Thus only after having received a BlockACK Request in the same or
in a subsequent TXOP the receiver replies by a BiockACK frame.

Tearing down an established BA session is accom­
plished by transmitting a "DELBA" frame. The recipient
sends a standard ACK frame to acknowledge the session
end.

E VA LUATION

A. T heoretical Analysis

A closed form solution for the theoretical limit of the
achievable throughput with Block Acknowledgment (BA)
is given in the following. This limit allows us to verify the
simulation results of later sections. For the IEEE 802.11e
contention-based protocol, it is in the following assumed
that the throughput is maximized if one single Station
(STA) continuously initiates frame exchanges, and no
other STA attempts to initiate frame exchanges in paral­
lel. No collisions would then occur, and frames are never
retransmitted, because the channel is further assumed to
be error-free. The assumption that such a scenario leads
to the maximum throughput is true for typical CWmin
values «100), but not for large CWmin values. With
large CWmin values, the throughput actually increases
with increasing number of contending STAs up to a
certain point, where then collisions become the dominant
factor, and the throughput decreases again with the
increasing number of STAs. However, in the following
we assume reasonably small values for CWmin, hence
the throughput is maximal if only one contending STA
is active.
1) Maximum achievable throughput without Block
Acknowledgment (BA): When using 802.11e Enhanced
Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) every transmission
starts with a backoff. The mean duration for the whole
backoff depends on the Access Category (AC). According
to the AC the fixed waiting time Arbitration IFS (AlFS)
is determined. The minimum size of the Contention
Window (CW) depends on the AC, too. Assuming an
error free transmission the CW never enlarges. Thus the
number of slots is drawn from the interval [0, CWmin].
As the random number of slots is drawn from a uniform
distribution its mean value is CWmi'Y'2, see (1).

Now we can easily calculate the duration of any
control, data or management frame. In 802.11e the Trans­
mission Opportunity (TXOP) Limit restricts the duration
for which a QoS Station (QSTA) may use the Wireless
Medium (WM). No further restrictions regarding the
number of MAC Service Data Units (MSDUs) are made.
Thus a QSTA may transmit a number of NMT MSDUs
per TXOP. Therefore the duration during which the WM
is busy is given by (5).

legacy MAC Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) will have a

MPDUs. Therefore the value of 34 B used here is meant

B. Analytical Comparison of Block Acknowledgment
(BA) and Standard Acknowledgment (ACK) Procedure

Comparing (7) and (11) the advantages of BA are
obvious. First of all BA reduces the number of Short
Inteiframe Spaces (SIFSs) in a burst of data transmission
by approximately 50%. Secondly (9) presents that the
number of ACK frames does not depend on the number
of transmitted MAC Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) any
more. Thus the impact of the additional overhead of
frames like BlockACK and BlockACKReq is negligible.

C. Simulative Analysis

We use event-driven stochastic simulations to dis­
cuss the efficiency of Block Acknowledgment (BA) in
802.11e. Simulation campaigns have been performed for
the 802.11a Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) Physical Layer (PHY). For delay results, we
give empirical Complementary Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) of the resulting stochastic data, using
the discrete Limited Relative Error (LRE) algorithm that
also measures the local correlations of the stochastic data
[16]. By measuring local correlations, the accuracy of
empirical simulation results can be estimated. All results
presented in this paper are within a maximum limited
relative error of 5%.
The simulations were performed using the Wireless Ac­
cess Radio Protocol 2 (WARP2) simulation environment
developed at the Chair of Communication Networks,
RWTH Aachen University [17]. It is programmed in
Specification and Description Language (SDL) using
Telelogics TAU SDL Suite (previously named SDL De­
sign Tool (SDT ) . The error model used in WARP2
to accurately simulate the Wireless Medium (WM) is
presented in [18].
D. Results

At the time the simulations were performed draft 5.0
[19] of 802. lie was the latest one. It did not require any
protective mechanism for Block Acknowledgment (BA).
Thus, our simulations are slightly different from the latest
draft [4] which we explain in this paper.
To survey the upper bound of the achievable through­
put and a lower bound for the minimal delay when using
BA, the simulated scenario consists of a sending and a
receiving Station (STA) only. They are placed very close
to each other.
The Transmission Opportunity (1XOP)Limit used in
the given scenario is bounded to 64 TXOPslots. Each
slot durates 32f-lB resulting in an overall TXOPLimit
of 2048f-lB. The simulations are performed using three
different Physical Layer (PHY) modes (64-QAM¥4, 16QAMV2 and BPSK3f4), four packet sizes (1500 B, 1024 B,
512 B and 48 B) and three different BA buffer sizes (64,
32 and 8) for the transmit- and reception buffers. For
comparison a simulation with standard Acknowledgment
(ACK) policy is included.
As Fig. 4, 5 and 6 present our simulation results
correspond to the analytical model of 802.11e. Especially
short frames benefit of the usage of BA at all PHY
modes. Large 1500 B frames benefit mainly a high PHY
modes since in 802.11 the overhead for large frames is
less compared to short frames. Considering the impacts
of BA on the delay and implementation issues a buffer
size of 32 seems to be an optimum, a buffer size of 64
offers only minor advantages but doubles the mean delay
almost.
E. Outlook

Future survey will study the impact of different
TXOPLimits on throughput and delay. Also, more com­
plicated scenarios will be studied, that give an under­
standing of BA when multiple STAs compete on the

medium. Furthermore simulations will be performed that
combine the advantages of BA and a central coordina­
tion instance using the HCF Controlled Channel Access
(HCCA). This will allow to survey a scenario competitive
to High Peiformance Local Area Network 2 (H2). At this
time Task Group (TG) "n" of 802.11 develops a new high
speed Medium Access Control (MAC). It shall be able
to carry a least 100 Mlfs in a single hop environment.
Especially 802.11n will benefit by the usage of BA.
Hence future studies on 802.11n will consider BA as
well. As it avoids unused idle periods of the Wireless
Medium (WM) it is a general method to support high
throughput services.

CON CLUSIONS

Block Acknowledgment (BA) as proposed in [4] is
presented in detail. To give a better understanding of the
procedure we give simulative and analytical results on
the usage of BA. Our results presents upper boundaries
to the achievable throughput and lower boundaries to
the delay. Therefore, we present best case results, that
give an understanding of the impact of BA. The sim­
ulation results are very well verified by our analytical
methods. The introduction of BA in 802.lIe improves
the protocol tremendously. Since the overhead is reduced
the efficiency increases even when using small buffer
sizes. Since its application can be handled very flexible
BA is one of the most important features of 802. lIe.
The ease of use and implementation combined with
the introduction of Transmission Opportunitys (TXOPs)
forms a powerful enhancement to the legacy standard.
