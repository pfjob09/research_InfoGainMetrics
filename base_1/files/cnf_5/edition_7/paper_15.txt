ABSTRACT
This paper presents a novel method of combining
Wavelet Transforms (WT) and Zernike Moments
(ZM) as a feature vector for face recognition.
Wavelet transform, with its approximate
decomposition is used to reduce the noise and
produce a representation in the low frequency
domain, and hence making the facial images
insensitive to facial expression and small
occlusion. The Zernike Moments, on the other
hand, is selected as feature extractor due to its
robustness to image noise, geometrical
invariants property and orthogonal property.
The simulation results on Essex Database
indicates that higher order degree of WT
combine with ZM achieve better performance
with respect to recognition rate rather than
using WT or ZM alone. The optimum result is
obtained for ZM of order 10 with Daubechies
orthonormal wavelet filter of order 7 in the first
decomposition level. It can achieve the
verification of 94.26%.

Introduction

Biometric deals with identification and
verification of individuals based on their
behavioral eg. dynamic signature verification,
voice prints verification and keystroke dynamic
verification or physiological characteristics eg.
face recognition, retinal scanning, iris scanning,
hand geometry and palm scanning. Face
recognition is one of the significant technologies
in biometrics due to its robust application in
security systems, identification of criminals,
assistance with speech recognition system,

surveillance, Closed Circuit Television (CCTD)
and user identification. Unlike human beings who
have the excellent capability to recognize different
patterns and faces, machines are still lacking of
this aptitude due to its variations in illuminations,
complex backgrounds, visual angles, facial
expressions and therefore, face recognition has
become a complex and challenging task for
researchers, scientists and physicists over the last
two decades.
In the early study, [1, 2] found that
information in low spatial frequency bands have a
dominant role in face recognition. Thereafter, [3]
showed that low-frequency components contribute
to the global description, while the high-frequency
components contribute to the finer details required
in the identification task. Nastar et al. [4, 5] have
observed the relationship between variations in
facial appearance and their deformation spectrum.
They found that facial expressions and small
occlusion affect the high-frequency spectrum
whereas changes in pose or scale of a face affect
their low frequency spectrum. Only a change in
face will affect all frequency components. Bow [6]
demonstrates that the quality of the reconstructed
image is very good if the image is restored with the
lower half-frequency spectrum.
The aforesaid shows that the low-frequency
components are already sufficient for recognition.
Hence, we proposed to use the wavelet transform
for face image decomposition.
According to wavelet theory, the subband LL
is the smoothed version of original image that
corresponds to low or middle band in the
frequency spectrum. As such, we can anticipate
that the subband LL features are insensitive to the
facial expression and small occlusion are optimal
for the recognition purpose.

On the other hand, Teaque [7] has
suggested the application of orthogonal moments
based on the theory of orthogonal polynomials to
efficient computation and image recovery. A
class of such orthogonal moments possessing the
rotation invariance property is Zernike Moments
(ZM).
In this paper, we investigate the
performance when WT and ZM are integrated to
take the advantages of these two methods in
order to achieve an excellent verification rate in
identifying the faces.
This paper is organized as follows. Section
2 describes wavelet transform based features and
their basic properties. In section 3, we define
Zernike Moments and their basic properties. The
experimental results are presented in section 4.
The conclusion is discussed in section 5.

by tensorial product. This kind of two-dimensional
wavelet transform leads to a decomposition of
approximation coefficients at level j-1 in four
components: the approximations at level j, Lj and
the details in three orientations (horizontal, vertical
and diagonal), Djvertical, Djhorizontal and Djdiagonal [10].
Discrete wavelet transform is used to
decompose the face image into a multiresolution
representation in order to keep the least
coefficients possible without losing useful image
information. Figure 1(a) demonstrates the
decomposition process by applying twodimensional wavelet transform of a face image in
level 1 and Figure 1(b) depicts three levels wavelet
decomposition by applying wavelet transform on
the low-frequency band sequentially.

Wavelet Transform

Wavelet transform is an excellent scale
analysis and interpreting tool [8]. It transforms
image into multiresolution representation, which
analyzes image variation at different scales and
provides good energy compaction (high image
information content) as well as adaptability to
human visual system. Wavelet transform offers
high temporal localization for high frequencies
while offering good frequency resolution for low
frequencies. Therefore, wavelet analysis has
been utilized to extract the local characteristics
from still images due to its local extent [9]. If an
orthonormal wavelet basis, say Daubechies or
Symmlets, was chosen, the coefficients
computed are independent to each other, a set of
distinct features of the original signal could be
obtained.
Besides,
wavelet
transform
decomposes image into a lower dimension
multiresolution representation, which grants a
structural configuration for analyzing the image
information and shorter computational time.
The wavelet decomposition of a signal f(x)
can be obtained by convolution of signal with a
family of real orthonormal basis, ψ a , b ( x )

The kernel of Zernike moments is a set of
orthogonal Zernike polynomials defined over the
polar coordinate space inside a unit circle. The

Experimental Results and
Discussion
The experiments were conducted by using
Faces-93 Essex University Face Database [11].
There are various aspects in the database which
made it appropriate to this experiment. Data
capture conditions are subject to photographed at
fixed distance from camera, and individuals are
asked to speak to produce images of the same
individuals with different facial expressions. The
database consists of 100 subjects with 10 images
for each subject. A total of 500 face images are
used to train and another 500 are used to test.
The image size is of 180 x 200 pixels, 256 –
level grayscale with uniform green background.
The face scale in the images is uniform and there
are minor variations in turn, tilt and slant.
Generally speaking, all wavelet transforms
with smooth, compactly support orthogonality
can be used in this approach. It is found that the
selection of different wavelets does not seriously
affect the performance of this approach. An

experiment was carried out to verify the
performance rate of Daubechies Filter 7 as shown
in Table 1. Subband L1 gives the optimum
verification rate of 94.22 % with FAR = 5.79 %
and FRR = 5.64%. Obviously, we can see from
Table 1 that the Subband L3 gives a poorer
recognition rate. This is because the down
sampling process gets rid of the face feature
structures of the coarser images; thus deteriorates
the discriminative power of the wavelet transform.

Another experiment was conducted by using a
dissimilar set of feature vectors based on the order
(h) of ZM to determine the moments which setting
is most favorably describe the face features. Table
2 shows the moments feature vectors of setting 1
to 10. The result of recognition rate measured by
Euclidean distance is shown in Figure 2. Note that
the recognition rate of moment in Figure 2 is
different from the verification rate as in Table 3.
Further analysis of the result was performed by
calculating the FAR and FRR as described in
Table 3. The verification rate of moment of setting
10 is 93.66% with FAR = 6.34% and FRR =
6.36%.

Table 3 Verification Rate for Moment of
Setting 10
We can see clearly from Figure 2 that the
highest recognition rate is 98.0 % of setting 10 moments of order 10. Therefore we can say that
setting 10 possesses the best features that
optimally illustrated face structure. Thus, setting
10 as our moments for the consequence
experiments is chosen. Besides, we noticed that
the higher the order of moments, the higher the
recognition rate. In other words, higher order
moments confine better and more detail
information about the face image. Compare to
the best result obtained in Table 1, we can
conclude that ZM itself performs better.
Therefore, another experiment was carried
by integrating ZM of order 10 and various
wavelet filters, namely Haar filters, Daubechies
family filters and Symmlet family filters. Table 3
depicts the comparison of verification rate
among various wavelet filters as said. From the
table, we find that the highest verification rate is
94.26% which is Daubechies orthonormal
wavelet filter order 7 with decomposition level 1
with FAR = 5.74% and FRR = 6.92%. Again,
we can see from Table 4 that the third
decomposition level performs the poorest.

Finally this experiment was carried out using
the chosen wavelet basis, namely Daubechies 7
with decomposition level 1 to observe the
verification rate among the four subbands, namely
subband L1, H1 vertical, H1 horizontal, and H1 diagonal as
shown in Table 5. We can observe that the
subband L1 yields the best performance which is
94.26% while other frequency subbands give
poorer performances. This indicates the claim that

Conclusion

An efficient method for face recognition
using wavelet transform and Zernike moments is
presented in this paper. Experiments have been
performed for the selection of the best basis, best
filter and best wavelet decomposition level.
Wavelet analysis produces lower dimension
multiresolution representation that alleviates
heavy computational load, and also generates
noise and minor distortion insusceptible to face
wavelet – based template. Higher order moments
of Zernike Moments comprise more prominent
information about face images. The overall
verification rate for the proposed method is
94.26%.
