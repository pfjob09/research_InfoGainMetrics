Abstract
Noise removal or noise suppression is important as the
results of the noise removal task have a strong influence
on the quality of the following image processing
techniques. In this paper, three popular filter that is
mean, median and adaptive filters are tested on 25 images
of songket motifs. Different sizes of the filter kernels are
also used as it plays a factor in producing the desired
results. Prior to noise removal, the images are subjected
to preprocessing operations such as histogram stretching
and image cleaning. To determine the performance of the
noise removal, visual evaluation is performed.

1. Introduction
Noise is any unwanted information that contaminates
an image. The digital image acquisition process, which
converts an optical image into continuous electrical signal
that is then sampled, is the primary source of noise [8]. It
is almost impossible to remove noise totally without
distorting an image, but it is imperative that noise is
reduced to a certain acceptable level for further analysis
of the image. Two most common types of additive noises
are Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise. Gaussian noise
normally occurs due to electronic noise in the image
acquisition system, while malfunctioning pixel elements
in the camera sensors, faulty memory locations or timing
errors in the digitization process may cause salt-andpepper noise [8]. Figure 1 below shows a songket pattern
corrupted with Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise,
respectively.

2. Noise Filtering
Spatial or frequency domain filters can be effectively
used to remove various types of noise in images [8]. Two
primary categories of spatial filters for noise removal are
rank order filters and mean filters. If an output pixel value
is calculated on the ranking of the pixels according to
their gray values inside the filter window, it is called rank
order filter. Examples of rank order filters are median
filter and minimum or maximum filter. Meanwhile,
frequency domain filtering operates by using the Fourier
transform representation of images. This representation
consists of information about the spatial frequency
content of the image. Something that changes quickly,
such as an edge, will have high-frequency components
[6]. Examples of frequency domain filters are inverse
filter and Wiener filter. Literature reviews of these filters
are presented in next sections.

2.1. Median Filter
Bovik and Munson [2] suggested that median filter is
best used to suppress salt-and-pepper noise. Calculation
of the median filter begins by ordering the N pixels
included in the filter window and setting the center pixel
to the median intensity value [5]. This has the effect of
forcing points with distinct intensities to be similar to its
neighbor, thus eliminating intensity spikes which appear
isolated. Median filter is one of the most popular
nonlinear filters [1]; it is computationally efficient and can
preserves or reconstruct edge and other image details
while removing noise.

2.2. Mean Filter

Figure 1. Gaussian vs. Salt & Pepper Noise

Mean or average filter is the simplest linear filter
which results in the smoothing of sharp features and thus
in the reduction of intensity disparity of pixels whose
intensities are much above or below those of the
neighbors [7]. According to Metherall [5], mean filter
removes high spatial frequencies from an image and
performs well on Gaussian noise [4] but in the presence of
salt-and-pepper noise, median filtering outperforms it. It
works by passing a mask over the image, calculating the

mean intensity for the mask and setting the central pixel to
this value. The size of the filter is chosen according to the
characteristic scales of desired image and noise features.
Seul et al. [7] recommended to set k = 2wN + 1 pixels to
blur objects with diameter wN or smaller. For example if
noise features are estimated not to exceeds 3 pixels in
diameter, filter length k  2 x 3 +1 = 7, is recommended
to reduce this noise.

2.3. Adaptive Wiener Filter
The Wiener filter [3] and its variant are designed to
work in cases where the noise has become significant.
Developed by Norbert Wiener in 1942, the filter attempts
to model the error in the restored image through the use of
statistical methods. An adaptive Wiener filter alters it
behavior as the image is processed, tailoring itself to the
local image variance. The filter, also known as Minimum
Mean-Square Error Filter works best with Gaussian
uniform noise and is defined as follows [8]:

MMSE

d(r,c) 

V n2
>d(r,c)  ml (r,c)@
V l2

where

V n2 = noise variance
V l2 = local variance
ml = local mean
When the noise variance is fairly equal to the local
variance, the filter acts as mean filter and performs more
smoothing. In areas where the local variance is much
greater than the noise variance, it performs less smoothing
and preserves edges or local details. By operating in this
manner, the filter adapts itself to the local image statistics,
preserving image details while removing noise.

3. Evaluation
The purpose of noise removal in this paper is to
enhance image quality, thus the filters performances are
evaluated based on visual quality. They are divided into
three groups:
Group 1 (Best): Noise is substantially suppressed and
fine details of the image are preserved.
Group 2 (Moderate): Noise is substantially suppressed
but certain image details are blurred.
Group 3 (Bad): No significant noise reduction or lost
of image details.

4. The Experiments
The images used in this experiment are twenty-five
songket motifs of Malaysia originating from Terengganu.
These songket motifs are extracted from songket patterns
and preprocessed prior to noise filtering.

4.1. Preprocessing
The patterns found on songket fabrics are divided into
4 compositions (Figure 2), which are patterns for badan,
kepala, pengapit and tepi kain. Each of these patterns
consists of several songket motifs arranged systematically
based on certain rules such as chained motifs, horizontal
or vertical designs or checkered. The first step in
preprocessing is to allow extraction of motifs from the
pattern (Figure 3).

Kepala

2.4. Spatial vs. Frequency Domain Filtering
Seul et al. [7] in his book stated that although
equivalent results can be achieved by means of filtering
by direct convolution in spatial domain or by Fourier
transformation and multiplication in the frequency
domain, there are computational trade-offs. The cost of
filtering in the frequency domain is fixed – that is, it is not
dependent on the size of the equivalent spatial domain
convolution filter. Conversely, in the spatial domain, the
computational cost of filtering depends on the filter size.
In general, when the spatial domain filter size is greater
than some number, then it is more efficient to filter in the
frequency domain. In most practical cases, it is more
efficient to perform filtering in the spatial domain.

During the extraction process, unwanted objects or
partial objects may be extracted together with the intended
motif. These extraneous details are removed by filling in
the selected region of interest with the values on the
boundary of the region. The fill smoothly interpolates
inward from the borders of the region (Figure 4). The
motif is also converted to grayscale image for further
processing.
Another method used for cleaning image is by
suppressing light objects connected to the image border
using morphological operations. However, this method
tends to reduce the overall intensity level in addition to
suppressing border structures. Figure 5 shows an example
of suppressing the image border. Notice how the overall
intensity of the image is slightly reduced.

0.25 and 0.85; while values of Low Out and High Out are
0 and 1, the program maps the intensity value 0.25 in the
input image to 0 in the output image, and 0.85 to 1. The
intensity values should be between 0 and 1 and are
multiplied by 255 to determine the actual values to use.

4.3. Noise Reduction
This paper experimented on three different types of
filtering that are adaptive filter known as Weiner, rankorder filter called median, and average filters. Adaptive
Wiener filters a gray scale image using neighborhoods of
size 3-by-3 or 5-by-5 to estimate the local image mean
and standard deviation. Similarly, the median filter also
uses neighborhoods of size 3-by-3 or 5-by-5 to calculate
the median as the output pixel. As for linear filtering, two
different filters are experimented on the images. They are
average filter and disk averaging filter. Average filtering
uses a square 3-by-3 or 5-by-5 filter on the image, while
disk averaging uses a circular filter within the square
matrix of side 2*radius+1. The user enters value for
radius. The tested filters are numbered as follows:
1) Adaptive Weiner filter using a 3x3 size kernel.
2) Adaptive Weiner using a 5x5 size kernel.
3) Average filter using a 3x3 size kernel.
4) Average filter using a 5x5 size kernel.
5) Disk averaging filter using radius size 3.
6) Disk averaging filter using radius size 5.
7) Disk averaging filter using radius size 7.
8) Median filter using a 3x3 size kernel.
9) Median filter using a 5x5 size kernel.

4.2. Histogram Stretching
Contrast enhancement by histogram stretching is
important because cleaning and removing unnecessary
details during preprocessing may deteriorate brightness
level of the image. The objective of this process is to
highlight the important portion of the image (in this case
the motif) by changing the contrast between the motif and
its background. Prior to histogram stretching on each
image, the histograms of these images are viewed
beforehand.
Stretching the histogram is based on
intensity values of the input image entered by the user.
The program maps values of Low In and High In in the
input image to Low Out and High Out in the output
image. For example, if values of Low In and High In are

A summary of the noise filtering experiments is shown
in Table 1. Column 2 presents the filters that significantly
removed noises and preserved image details; column 3
shows the filters that removed noises but blurred some
image details and the last column states filters that do not
significantly remove noises from the image or
substantially modify the shape of the image. The results
show that sixty-one percent of the motifs are best filtered
using average filter type, followed by twenty-five percent
using adaptive filter and fourteen percent using median
filter.
The type of filter chosen to remove the noise depends
on the type of noise that exists in the motifs. For
example, Figure 6 demonstrates a motif with grain
(Gaussian) noise filtered using a 7x7 averaging filter.
Each pixel in the image is set to the average value of its
neighborhood thus reducing local discrepancies caused by
the grain noise. However, this method causes blurring of
the motif’s edges.

with the images differently to achieve the desired result
that resembles the actual motif.
For future work, more filters such as morphological
filter or nonlinear filters can be added and tested in the
experiments. Other than visual evaluation, numerical
evaluation such as the mean-square error and correlation
ratio can also be used as performance evaluation.

On the other hand, motif with irregular distinct
intensities is best filtered using median filter. This type of
noise is suppressed by eliminating pixels with dissimilar
intensity to be similar to its surrounding pixels. An
example of using a 5x5 median filter can be seen in
Figure 8. Although median filter does not minimize
noises as efficiently as average filter but it preserves
edges better.

6. Conclusion and Future Work
The primary objective of noise filtering in this paper is
to reduce noise as much as possible without altering the
shape of the original songket motif. Results of noise
filtering showed that the best filter for songket motif is
average filter as majority of the images contain Gaussian
or grainy noise. Filtering can also be improved by using
the correct filter size. However, motifs that have a lot of
intricate details are better filtered using adaptive filter to
maintain its unique shape. And for motifs with erratic
dissimilar intensities, they are best filtered using median
filter. The suggestions given in this paper are based on
the experimental results. It can be conclude that there is
not a single optimally suited method of noise filtering for
all songket motif images. It is often best to experiment
