Abstract
There has been vast research in the area of
computer aided geometric design in order to identify
algorithms to design objects. Timmer Parametric
Cubic or Timmer PC was introduced by Harry Timmer
as a follow up to the legendary Bezier curves. However
it was then not utilized as it does not satisfy convex
hull property, CHP. Since then, there lack studies to
explore the possible usages and discover the
uniqueness of Timmer PC.
This paper discusses comprehensively the steps
involved to generate a piecewise Timmer curve with G1
and G2 continuity. In the last section, a wine glass is
rendered via surface of revolution as an example of
implication to designing environment using the
Timmer curve.

1. Introduction
The two historical methods of controlling a curve
are interpolation and least squares. The recent method
(in the later half of 20th century) of rendering a curve is
through control points. The generated curves are
piecewise polynomials and are defined in terms of
control points. Thus, the curve is subjected to its
control points.
Two properties of a fair curve are smoothness and a
small number of spirals [1], [2]. In the designing
environment, smooth curve is often termed as G0
continuous and it allows cusps. A cusp is a place
where the tangent suddenly changes direction. Tangent
is defined as a linear approximation to a curve in a
smooth region of the curve. In the purpose of
designing, unit tangent vectors are used in order to
give direction of travel to render a curve. If a curve
and its unit tangent vectors are continuous, the curve is

said to have G1 continuity [1]. In many CAD/CAM
technologies, G1 continuity is adequate to shape
objects.
A curve can also be generated with G2 continuity.
A curve which has its unit tangent vector and curvature
continuous is said to have G2 continuity [1]. The
curvature of a curve at a point is the reciprocal of the
radius of the osculating circle of curvature at that
point. The sign of the curvature represents the
direction of travel of the curve. When the curvature
has positive sign, the circle of the curvature is on the
left of the curve and the curvature has negative sign if
the circle of the curvature is on the right of the circle.
The point where the curvature has a sign change is
called an inflection point [1]. A place where the
derivative of the curvature has sign change is called a
point of curvature extremum [1]. A curvature plot is
obtained by plotting the signed curvature against the
parameter [3]. Curvature plot has been one the way
designers evaluate curves before product development.
A spiral is a curve of monotone increasing or
monotone decreasing curvature of one sign [1], [7].
Thus, a spiral cannot have an inflection point or
curvature extremum. Since these two special points
define a spiral, thus one can easily segment a curve
into a finite number of spirals. To add, Farin has also
stated that a fair curve is a curve with small number of
spiral pieces and the curvature extremum should occur
only where the designer wants it [2], [3].
In early 1980s Harry Timmer of McDonnell
Douglas created Timmer PC [3]. The creation was a
manipulation of Bezier curve. Harry Timmer forced
the curve to interpolate the endpoints of the control
polygon and to be tangent to the control polygon at the
endpoints. In addition, he also forced the curve to go
through the midpoint of the line segment P1- P2. The
resulting polynomial bases are:

It can be concluded that Timmer curves behave in a
same manner as Bezier except for CHP and VDP in
which it disobeys [4].

This paper focuses on constructing a piecewise
Timmer curve which is G1 and G2 continuous
respectively. The study is also extended to the
application of the Timmer curve to generate a
particular design of a product.

There are many local methods that can produce G1
interpolation of Timmer curve. In this paper, a general
procedure has been implemented wherein a curve is
generated by solving the two-point G1 interpolation
problem for neighbouring pairs of given points and
unit tangents [1]. Hence, by joining the results, a G1
continuous Timmer curve is constructed.
The G1 data for Timmer curve that is to be matched
is as shown in Figure 2. Let the Timmer PC curve be
represented as H 0 (t ) , the control points are denoted
as P0 ( x 0 , y 0 ), P1 ( x1 , y1 ), P2 ( x 2 , y 2 ) & P3 ( x3 , y 3 ) and
the unit tangent vector
as T0 (m0 , n0 ) and
T1 (m1 , n1 ) respectively. The values for the first and
last control points are given as desired by the designer.
Hence, P1 and P2 are calculated as followed:
P1 ( x1 , y1 ) ( x 0  D m 0 , y 0  D n 0 )
(3)
P2 ( x 2 , y 2 ) ( x 3  E m1 , y 3  E n1 )
where Į and ȕ are positive real numbers. Subsequently,
the designer may control the shape of the curve
without changing the first and the last control polygon
by substituting Į and ȕ with desired values. Finally,
H 0 (t ) is rendered from equation 2.

In order to join another Timmer curve, H 1 (t ) with
H 0 (t ) , the designer must:
x

use the last control point of H 0 (t ) as the first
control point of H 1 (t ) and

x

the unit tangent vector for the last control
point of H 0 (t ) equals to unit tangent vector
for the first control point of H 1 (t ) .

Thus, the control points for curve H 1 (t ) are
denoted
as
P3 ( x3 , y 3 ), P4 ( x 4 , y 4 ), P5 ( x5 , y 5 ) & P6 ( x 6 , y 6 )
and
the unit tangent vectors are T1 (m1 , n1 ) and
T2 (m2 , n 2 ) . Consequently, the control points
P4 ( x 4 , y 4 ) and P5 ( x5 , y 5 ) are calculated from
equation 4.

piecewise Timmer curve with G1 continuity. Figure 3
shows an example of matching G1 continuous Timmer
curve for H 0 (t ) . The same pattern of calculation is
applied to join more Timmer curves.

4. A G2 continuous Piecewise Timmer
curve
The method which has been implemented to
produce a G2 interpolating Timmer curve is by solving
the two-point G2 interpolation problem and then
joining the solutions [1].
Let the Timmer curve be represented as H 0 (t ) and
the control points to be represented as
P0 ( x0 , y 0 ), P1 ( x1 , y1 ), P2 ( x 2 , y 2 ) & P3 ( x3 , y 3 )
with
the unit tangent vectors denoted as T0 (m0 , n0 ) and
T1 (m1 , n1 ) . P1 and P2 are calculated from equation 3.
Subsequently, a simultaneous pair of equation is
solved in order to find the appropriate value for Į and
ȕ which will lead to a G2 continuous Timmer curve. A
pair of simultaneous equation is derived from the
formula of signed curvature, N (t ) , which is defined in
plane as:
H c(t ) u H cc(t )
N (t )
|| H c(t ) || 3
( x c(t ), y c(t )) u ( x cc(t ), y c(t ))
( ( x c(t )) 2  ( y c(t )) 2 ) 3
( x c(t ) y cc(t ))  ( x cc(t ) y c(t ))

(5)

(( x c(t )) 2  ( y c(t )) 2 ) 3 / 2
The radius of curvature, R, is the absolute value of
the reciprocal of N (t ) .
The derivative of Timmer PC is required to
compute the curvature. The derivative is required at
t=0 (at P 0 ( x 0 , y 0 ) ) and t=1 (at P 3 ( x 3 , y 3 ) ) in order
to obtain a G2 continuous Timmer curve.
Hence, equation 5 yields a pair of equation in terms
of Į and ȕ when the designer fixes the desired radius,
R0 and R1 respectively, along with the sign. The
simultaneous pair of equation can be in the form of
quadratic equations, or a single fourth-degree equation.
However, the curve can’t match all the possible G2
interpolation data in which Į and ȕ may occur as
imaginary numbers. Hence, the applicable values to
render a G2 continuous Timmer curve are when Į and
ȕ are positive real numbers (equation 3).

Timmer curve, H 0 (t ) , with the following properties:

Since the Timmer curve cuts the intermediate
control points equally, one may easily construct a
piecewise Timmer curve swiftly.
One can straightforwardly examine the quality of
these curves (the presence of inflection points,
curvature extrema and monotone increase/decrease of
curvature) by plotting the curvature plot and the
derivative of the curvature versus parameter plot.
H0(t) encompasses of three spirals with an inflection
and curvature extrema. Thus, it is not a fair curve but
this particular Timmer curve has been rendered in
accord with the designers’ desire. However, H1(t) and
H2(t) holds the entity of a fair curve whereby both
curves comprise of an inflection point which splits the
curve into exactly two spirals. Too add, it has no
curvature extrema.
The profile of the wine glass shown in Figure 6 is
then revolved y-axis in order to obtain the surface of a
wine glass (Figure 7).

G1 and G2 continuous piecewise Timmer curves has
been shown and it clearly indicates that Timmer curve
has its uniqueness. Further enhancement of Timmer
curves should be looked into in order to diversify the
existing capabilities of Timmer parametric cubic.

6. Future work
The piecewise Timmer curve which is joined
geometrically has its drawback wherein there are
chances for the piecewise Timmer curve to have
inflection points and curvature extrema. However,
similar problem arises when one uses Bezier curve [6].
Therefore, it is not suitable for highway designs and
robot trajectory in which a spiral type of curve is used.
Walton and Meek [7] have successfully developed
cubic Bezier spiral in order to overcome this problem.
Hence, in order to improve the robustness for Timmer
curve, one may attempt to develop a planar cubic
Timmer spiral and join it geometrically as described in
the paper.
