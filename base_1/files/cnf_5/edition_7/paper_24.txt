how to sample plays an important role. Sampling too
densely, i.e., over-sampling, will increase computing
consumption; sampling too sparsely, i.e., under-sampling,
will lead to inconsistent triangulation. In [1], a guide was
proposed to detect under- and over-sampling of a sampled

Sampling each Σ i as step 2~4 until all Σ i s of Σ are sampled.
Method 3 is in fact a divide-and-conquer sampling
procedure. It can be carried out recursively.
Some remarks for method 3:
(1) If some Σ i is parabolic (means all points on it are
parabolic points), stop sampling after step 3;
(2) If Pm is an umbilical point, take arbitrarily two

Step 3.Repeating step 2 until all segments are sampled.

3. Method for sampling 3D surfaces
It appears to be complicated for the surface case. We
know from the knowledge of differential geometry that a
surface without umbilical points can be parameterized to
have lines of curvature as its parameter network because
these lines form orthogonal networks. In the light of this,
the following method 3 for sampling a surface is built.
Method 3:
Step 1. Dividing the surface Σ to be sampled into several
sub-surfaces Σ i with continuous curvature;
Step 2. For a Σ i , sampling its boundary curves using
method 2;
Step 3. As to the points got in step 2, their lines of
curvature divide Σ i into several patches. Then
