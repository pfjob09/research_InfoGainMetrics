Abstract
We propose a new method for error-bounded Bspline curve approximation based on dominant point
selection. The method first selects from the given
points initial dominant points that govern the overall
shape of the point set. It then computes a knot vector
using the dominant points and performs B-spline curve
fitting to all the given points. If the fitted B-spline
curve cannot approximate the points within a specified
tolerance, the method selects more points as dominant
points and repeats the curve fitting process. The knots
are determined in each iterative process by averaging
the parameters of the dominant points. The shape
index of a point set is introduced to facilitate the
dominant point selection during the iterative curve
fitting process. Compared with conventional methods
presented for B-spline curve approximation, the
proposed method requires much less control points to
approximate the given point set with the desired shape
fidelity.

1. Introduction
Curve approximation is one of the most classic but
essential problems in the field of computer aided
geometric design [1-6]. This paper addresses the
problem of B-spline curve approximation of a set of
ordered points within a specified tolerance. The
important issue in this problem is to reduce the number
of knots and, correspondingly, the number of control
points while keeping the desired accuracy in the
resulting B-spline curve. Several methods have been
investigated for data reduction in error-bounded Bspline curve approximation [3,7-10]. As it is usually
not known in advance how many control points are
required to obtain the desired accuracy, this problem
generally requires an iterative process that adjusts the
number of control points, the knots, and the parameters
to maintain an error bound [2,3,4,7,8,11]. Least-

squares curve fitting is often used as one step in this
iterative process.
In this paper we propose a new method for errorbounded B-spline curve approximation based on the
selection of dominant points. Its basic idea is simple
and straightforward. After selecting from the given
points initial dominant points that govern the overall
shape of the point set, the method computes a knot
vector using the dominant points and performs Bspline curve fitting to all the points to obtain a B-spline
curve that minimizes the error in the least-squares
sense. If the fitted B-spline curve cannot approximate
the points within the specified tolerance, the method
selects more points as dominant points and repeats the
curve fitting process. The knots are determined in each
iterative process by averaging the parameters of the
dominant points. The resulting curve is a piecewise Bspline curve of order (degree+1) p with Cp-2 continuity
at each knot.
In this paper, the shape index of a point set is
introduced to facilitate the dominant point selection
during the iterative curve fitting process. The shape
index measures how complex the point set is in shape,
which is estimated by combining the total curvature
and the arc length of the point set. With this shape
index, the method selects fewer points at flat regions
but more points at complex regions as dominant points.
The proposed method for error-bounded curve
approximation requires much less control points to
approximate the given point set with the desired shape
fidelity than the methods presented in previous works
[3,7-10].

A parametric B-spline curve of order (degree+1) p
can be defined by

where B i are control points and N i , p (t ) are the
normalized B-spline functions of order p defined on a
knot vector T ^t 0 , t1 ,..., t n p 1 , t n p ` . The knot vector
consists of non-decreasingly real-valued numbers [3].
B-spline curve fitting is to construct a B-spline
curve C(t ) from a sequence of distinct points Pi
(i=0,..,m). Given parameters ti of the points Pi , the
order p of B-spline functions, and a knot vector T of a
B-spline curve C(t ) , the least-squares B-spline curve
fitting determines the control points B j (j=0,..,n) of the
curve by minimizing the following least-squares error:

Generally, m is not less than n. When linear constraints
such as positions, tangents, or higher derivatives are
given, they can be incorporated into Eq. (2) using
Lagrange multipliers [3]. The least-squares
minimization problem is transformed into the one of
solving a linear system.
Selection of the parameters ti and the knot vector T
is critical to the quality of the fitted curve C(t ) . An
approach widely adopted for this process is as follows:
determine the parameters and place the knots to reflect
the distribution of the parameters and to guarantee that
every knot span contains at least one parameter. The
parameters ti at the points Pi can be given by the
general exponent method [2,7]:

u i u d  k . This is called the averaging technique for
m n , and the knot placement technique for m ! n .
Recently, Piegl and Tiller [12] suggested another knot
placement technique that is a generalization of the
averaging technique. With these methods, the knots

reflect the distribution of the parameters ti and
singular linear systems rarely occur during B-spline
curve fitting.

3. B-spline curve approximation method
Given a set of ordered points Pi (i=0,..,m) and a
specified tolerance G , we seek a B-spline curve C(t )
that approximates the given points so that the distance
between the curve and the points should be smaller
than the tolerance.
Several methods have been proposed for errorbounded B-spline curve approximation [3,7-10].
Basically, error-bounded curve approximation can be
achieved by one of two incremental methods which
either start with few control points, fit, check deviation,
and add control points if necessary; or start with many
control points, fit, check deviation, and remove control
points if necessary [3,7]. Because more control points
does not always result in a B-spline curve with less
approximation error, the forward incremental method
tends to require less control points than the backward
incremental method. A knot-removal method [9-10],
which is a kind of backward incremental method, can
be adopted for error-bounded B-spline curve
approximation. This starts with a B-spline curve that
interpolates all the points, and it removes knots
progressively without perturbing the B-spline curve by
more than the given tolerance.
The incremental methods are slower in computation
than a bisection method. The bisection method [7,8]
chooses lower and upper limits of the number of
control points with the assumption that a B-spline
curve cannot be fitted with control points whose
number is not greater than the lower limit, but a Bspline curve can be fitted with control points whose
number is not less than the upper limit. The bisection
method computes a B-spline curve with control points
whose number is at the middle of the current interval.
The interval is progressively divided in half. If the
fitted curve is within the tolerance, the upper limit is
replaced with the middle number. Otherwise, the lower
limit is replaced with the middle number. The process
is repeated until the size of the interval is equal to one.
The bisection method tends to require more control
points than the forward incremental method.
It might be possible to solve some nonlinear
optimization problem and get an optimal B-spline
curve defined by the minimum number of control
points and the optimal knots [13]. However, this
approach is too time-consuming and its stability is not
assured. The method proposed here for error-bounded
B-spline curve approximation falls into an incremental

method, but it is based on the proper selection of
dominant points that govern the overall shape of the
point set. Summarized below are main steps of the
proposed method.
Input: points Pi (i=0,..,m) and tolerance G .
Output: B-spline curve C(t ) of order p.
(1) Determine the parameters ti of the points Pi .
(2) Estimate the curvatures of the given points by
computing a base curve that captures the overall
shape of the point set.
(3) Using the curvature information, determine initial
dominant points D j (j=0,..,n) from the points Pi .
(4) Determine a knot vector T using the dominant
points D j .
(5) Perform least-squares B-spline curve fitting to the
points Pi .

(a)

(b)

(6) If the current B-spline curve C(t ) approximates
the points Pi within the tolerance G , then quit the
procedure with the current curve. Otherwise, do
the following steps.
(7) Update the curvatures of the points using the
current curve.
(8) Choose more points as dominant points D j based
on the shape information of the point set.
(9) Go to Step (4) and repeat the process.
The basic idea of the proposed method is to select
from the given points some dominant points and to
perform B-spline curve fitting to all the given points. If
the fitted B-spline curve is not satisfactory, the method
selects more points as dominant points and repeats the
curve fitting process. Selection of dominant points is
based on the shape information of the point set.
Figure 1 shows an example of the error-bounded Bspline curve approximation using the proposed method
where tolerance is given as G 5 u 102 . Figure 1(a)
shows a point set consisting of 201 points sampled
from a concept car profile. The points are enclosed in a
66 u 19 rectangle. Bigger solid points denote dominant
points. Figure 1(b) shows a cubic B-spline curve
obtained with 19 initial dominant points. Figure 1(c)
shows the point set with 29 final dominant points,
where 10 more points are included as dominant points.
Figure 1(d) shows a cubic B-spline curve obtained
with the final dominant points. Parameters and knots
are drawn at the bottom of each curve. Solid dots on
vertical line segments for the parameters denote
dominant points.

3.1. Estimation of discrete curvatures
Curvatures of the given points provide useful
information to describe the shape of the points. Given
a set of points, the curvature ki at a point Pi can be
estimated by local methods [14-16] or by B-spline
curve fitting methods [2,3,7,8]. The local methods use

the local geometry of the point Pi such as a circular
arc or a quadratic curve passing through three points
Pi 1 , Pi , Pi 1 . When the given points are noisy, discrete
curvatures computed with the local methods contain
more severe noises. Handling noisy discrete curvatures
is another challenging problem even though noisy
discrete curvatures can be made smooth using various
smoothing techniques [15,16].
We take the approach of B-spline curve fitting with
a more loose tolerance V (for example, 5~10 times
bigger than G ) and obtain a cubic B-spline curve that
captures the overall shape of the point set while
keeping discrete curvatures varying smoothly. We call
it a base curve. In this work, we have adopted the
bisection method [7,8] with a tolerance V 7G in
order to obtain a candidate for the base curve. For
another candidate for the base curve, we perform one
step of least-squares B-spine curve fitting after
estimating the number of control points based on the
ratio of arc length to chord length from the start point
to a current point [17]. If the ratio is greater than a
specified bound, we increase the number of control
points and mark the current point as the start point.
Otherwise, we go to the next point. In this work, the
ratio bound is given as 1.008 . Between the two
candidate curves, we choose the curve with the smaller
number of control points as the base curve. The
parameters are determined with the chord length
parameterization, and the knots with the knot
placement technique [3]. Figure 2 shows a base curve
computed from the point set used in Figure 1. The
curve is a cubic B-spline curve defined by 16 control
points.

at each cycle of the iterative process, so they become
more reliable as the iteration proceeds.

3.2. Selection of dominant points
After estimating the discrete curvatures of the given
points, we find initial dominant points. The initial
dominant points consist of two end points and feature
points of the given points. We consider two kinds of
feature points: local curvature maximum and minimum
points. Inflection points belong to local curvature
minimum points. From the curvature plot of the points,
we classify feature points into two using the following
rules.
z If ki ! k i1 and k i ! k i 1 , the point Pi is considered
as a local curvature maximum point. This point
corresponds to a peak in the curvature plot.
z If ki  ki 1 and ki  ki 1 , the point Pi is considered
as a local curvature minimum point. This point
corresponds to a trough nearest to the x-axis in
the curvature plot.
We search all the points to find local curvature
maximum points satisfying the first rule. Among the
curvature maximum points, we discard the points with
curvatures smaller than the lower curvature bound klow .
In this work, we have set klow k avg / 4 where the value
k avg is the average of the curvatures of the given points.
After determining the local curvature maximum
points, we find local curvature minimum points.
Between two successive local curvature maximum
points, there exist local curvature minimum points
satisfying the second rule. Among them, we choose the
point with the smallest curvature and discard the others.
Figure 3 shows the curvature plot of the point set
used in Figure 1. The dotted horizontal line denotes the
average curvature of the given points. From the
curvature plot, we find 19 initial dominant points: 2
end points, 8 curvature maximum points, and 9
curvature minimum points. One curvature maximum
point is discarded because it is tiny. So the point with
the smaller curvature is selected between two curvature
minimum points near the discarded curvature
maximum point. See the initial dominant points in
Figure 1(a).

and D j 1 Pe ( s  e ), we build a polygonal segment
S s,e defined by the points Pk (k=s,..,e). The selection

Figure 3. Curvature plot.
Now we introduce the shape index of a polygonal
segment to facilitate the dominant point selection. The
shape index measures the shape complexity of the
polygonal segment, which is estimated by combining
the total curvature and the arc length of the segment.
For a polygonal segment S s,e consisting of ordered
points Pk (k=s,..,e), its shape index SI s ,e is defined by:
TK s ,e
ALs ,e

SI s ,e r
TK 0,m
AL0,m
where 0 d r d 1 . The value TK s ,e denotes the total

of (p-n-1) dominant points is based on the shape
indices of the segments. Consider the points not
belonging to the dominant points to be called normal
points. Among the segments with at least one normal
point, that is, s  1  e , we find the segment with the
greatest shape index and choose one normal point
belonging to the polygonal segment as a new dominant
point. This process is repeated until we have up to p
dominant points.
When a B-spline curve fitted with the current
dominant points is not satisfactory, additional points
should be included as new dominant points. We first
determine candidate points, one from each polygonal
segment with at least one normal point. Among the
candidate points, the points with greater deviations to
the fitted curve progressively become new dominant
points. In this paper, we simply choose one new
dominant point with the greatest deviation.

The denominator AL0, m denotes the approximant of

experience, total curvature is much more dominant
than arc length for defining the shape complexity of a
polygonal segment. In this work, we set r 0.8 .
Notice that the shape index is a normalized value
ranging from 0 to 1. We have found a tendency that
the higher index a polygonal segment has, the more
complex shape it has.
In case that the number (n+1) of the initial
dominant points is less than the order p of B-splines,
we must select additional (p-n-1) dominant points to
obtain an initial B-spline curve. Notice that we can
have n polygonal segments with the (n+1) dominant
points. For two consecutive dominant points D j Ps

A more promising approach is to select the point Pnew
such that the shape index SI s ,new of a polygonal

S s,e , that is, SI s ,new

curvatures are nearly the same or very small, this

the polygonal segment S s ,e into two with the nearly
same arc lengths. Figure 4 shows iterative selection of
3 more dominant points after 19 initial dominant points
have been determined. Red circles are used to denote
newly inserted dominant points.

3.3. Determination of parameters and knots
Once (n+1) dominant points are properly selected
from the given point set, the computation of a B-spline
curve of order p is straightforward. We determine the
parameters ti of the points Pi using the chord length
method because it is generally adequate for B-spline
curve fitting [2,3]. Then we compute knots by
averaging the parameter values of the current dominant
points so that the resultant knot vector coincides with
the one for B-spline curve interpolation to the
dominant points [2,3]. In every step of B-spline curve
fitting, the number of control points is equal to that of
the current dominant points. This means that each knot
span contains at least one parameter value and the
system matrix is not singular according to the
Schoenberg-Whitney theorem [1]. Hence, we can
obtain a B-spline curve easily and successfully. After
determining the parameters and the knots, we just
perform the least-squares curve fitting.
The knots are determined directly from the
dominant points, which have been selected based on
shape information of the given point set. In recent
works [16,17], shape information was used in knot
selection to acquire better approximation. Razdan [17]
dealt with knot selection for B-spline curve
approximation of a given curve and took a simple
algorithm that selects interpolation points on the curve
and interpolates them with a cubic B-spline curve. He
adopted cubic B-spline curve interpolation with end-

conditions and made the knots identical to the
parameters of the selected points. Li et al. [16]
proposed a similar algorithm for knot selection for Bspline curve approximation. They adopted leastsquares curve fitting and made the knots identical to
the parameters of the selected points. But their
heuristic rule for knot placement tends to require more
knots than what is expected. Although the previous
works [16,17] adopted the concept of the knot
selection based on shape information, this concept was
not fully incorporated into the error-bounded curve
approximation.

3.4. Distance metrics for approximation
The
distance
between
the
point
set
{Pi | i 0,.., m} and the fitted curve C(t ) can be
defined in various ways. Two definitions of the
distance are considered in this paper. When the degree
of mismatch between the curve C(t ) and the discrete
points Pi is considered, the distance is defined as
~
dist (C, P) max dist (C, Pi ) max || Pi  Pi || (9)
P

i

i

where dist (C, Pi ) is the distance from the point Pi to
~ is the orthogonal
the curve C(t ) and the point P
i
projection of the point Pi onto the curve C(t ) .
When the degree of mismatch between the curve
C(t ) and all the points lying on the polygon P is
considered, the distance is defined as
dist (C, P) H (C, P) max(h(C, P), h(P, C)) (10)
where h(C, P ) max aC min bP || a  b || . This distance
is called Hausdorff distance between C and P [7,18].
The function h(C, P) is called the directed Hausdorff
distance from C to P. It is not easy to compute the
distance H (C, P) , but we can check if the distance is
smaller than a specified tolerance G . Let L j be a
chord joining two points Pj and P j 1 (j=0,..,m-1). After

the line segment L j [7]. As each segment CS j can be
locally represented in B-splines, its convex hull
property can be fully utilized in the containment test.

4. Experimental results
The proposed method for error-bounded B-spline
curve approximation has been implemented in C on an
IBM compatible personal computer with an Intel
Pentium IV processor. The method has been tested on
various point sets, with the result that the method has
worked well. Error checks have been performed and
found that fitted B-spline curves were within specified
tolerances.
To show how well the proposed method works in
the sense of data reduction and shape fidelity, we have
also implemented three other methods and compared
them to the proposed method by the number of control
points and by the computation time. The three methods
are the forward incremental method, the bisection
method, and the knot-removal method [3,7-10]. In the
forward incremental method and the bisection method,
the parameters are determined with the chord length
method, and the knots are determined with the knot
placement technique proposed by Piegl and Tiller [3].
The knot-removal method is based on the work done
by Lyche and Mørken [9,10].
Firstly, B-spline curve approximation was tested
with the point set used in Figure 1. Figure 5 shows
cubic B-spline curves obtained with four different
approaches. Tolerance is given as G 5 u 102 . Figure
5(a) shows a curve obtained using the proposed
method. Figure 5(b)-(d) show curves obtained using
three other methods. The control polygon of each
curve is displayed. Knots are drawn at the bottom of
each curve. Figure 6 summarizes the comparisons of
cubic B-spline curve approximation with four different
methods for four tolerance levels.

Secondly, B-spline curve approximation was tested
with a point set consisting of 251 points scanned from
a human face profile. The points enclosed in a 84 u 126
rectangle contain some noises. Figure 7 shows Bspline curve approximation using the proposed method
where tolerance is given as G 5 u 102 . Figure 7(a)
shows a cubic B-spline base curve defined by 18
control points. Computing the curvatures at the points
from the base curve, the proposed method found 22
initial dominant points. Starting with the initial
dominant points, the method generated a cubic Bspline curve with 37 final dominant points. Figure 7(b)
shows the point set with the final dominant points.

approximation with four different methods for four

Notice that the proposed method requires fewer
control points at flat regions but more control points at
complex regions. The knot-removal method shows a
similar trend, but it does not perform better than the
proposed method. From the experimental results, we
have found that the proposed method requires much
less control points than the previous methods and that
the method requires less computation time in most
cases than the forward incremental method but more
than the bisection method.

5. Concluding remarks
[3]

We have proposed a new method for B-spline curve
approximation of a set of ordered points to a specified
tolerance. The method is based on the selection of
dominant points from the given point set. The resulting
curve is a piecewise B-spline curve of order p with Cp-2
continuity at each knot. The proposed method,
utilizing shape information in knot selection to yield
better approximation, has the following attractive
features:
z In each step of B-spline curve fitting, the knots
are easily determined by averaging the parameters
of the selected dominant points, making a Bspline curve created easily and successfully.
z The shape index of a point set properly facilitates
the dominant point selection during the iterative
curve fitting process.
z The concept of the knot selection based on shape
information is fully incorporated into the errorbounded curve approximation.
z The approach can be applied to the points in
space, not confined to planar points.
Compared with the conventional methods presented
for error-bounded B-spline curve approximation, the
proposed method requires much less control points to
approximate the given point set with the desired shape
fidelity. In order to improve the approximation quality
further, the resulting B-spline curve of the method can
be used as an initial solution of the optimization
problem using non-deterministic methods [19-21]. The
method can be adopted as a key ingredient for B-spline
curve approximation of free-form curves [7].
We are currently investigating how to expand the
proposed method for lofted surface approximation to a
set of contours [12,22,23]. We are also investigating
how the performance of the method is dependent upon
