Abstract
Solid blending with the n th order continuity is
investigated in this paper. We use up to the n th
partial derivatives to define the continuity at the
boundary surfaces between the blended solids and the
blending solid, and introduce basic functions to
transform the original boundary conditions into
simpler ones. The mathematical description of a
blending solid is discussed and a set of linear
algebraic equations are derived to determine the
unknown constants in the constructed function of the
blending solid. Several numerical examples are given
to demonstrate both the applications of the proposed
approach in solid blending and the effects of different
continuities on the smoothness between the blending
solid and blended solids.
Key Words: Solid blending, boundary definition, n th
order continuity, surface construction

1. Introduction
Curves, surfaces and solids are three types of
commonly used geometric entities in geometric
applications. There has been a lot of literature
investigating the modelling of curves and surfaces [114]. Here, we only briefly review the work in solid
modelling.
Solid modelling was introduced in books by
Mäntylä [15], Hoffmann [16], and Hoschek and
Lasser [17], and the book chapter by Voelcker and
Requicha [18]. Bézier invented free form
deformations
[19].
Using
Bernstein-Bézier
representation of volumes, Lasser discussed the
construction of a volume point and its first
derivatives in this point as well as the solution of the
interpolation problem [20]. Sederberg and Parry
presented a technique to deform solid geometric
models in a free-form manner based on trivariate

Bernstein polynomials [21]. Chao et al. described a
solid modelling system based on the polyhedron
approach by approximating a nonplanar surface by a
series of planes [22]. Metaxas and Terzopoulos
developed a systematic approach to deriving dynamic
models from parametrically defined solid primitives,
global geometric deformations and local finiteelement deformations [23]. Rappoport et al.
presented a novel method for modelling an object
composed of several tensor-product solids while
preserving the desired volume of each primitive and
ensuring high-order continuity constraints between
the primitives [24]. Mastin demonstrated how
rational Bezier basis functions can be used to
generate three-dimensional solids used in solid
modelling and in the generation of grids [25]. Using
geometric properties and the topology of geometric
primitives, Shin, B.-S. and Shin, Y.G. presented an
efficient algorithm to reconstruct solid models which
is much faster than previous algorithms [26]. Based
on the assumption of continuity, Raghothama and
Shapiro gave a formal definition for boundary
representation (BR-) deformation for solids in the
same parametric family [27]. Hua and Qin presented
a haptic sculpting system founded upon scalar
trivariate B-spline functions and developed a large
variety of sculpting toolkits equipped with an
intuitive haptic interface to facilitate the direct
manipulation of implicit functions in real-time [28].
McDonnell and Qin integrated the geometry of
sculptured free-form solids with a physics-based
modelling framework. They developed a sculpting
system with an array of design tools that can deform
and sculpt a variety of free-form solids via a 3D
input device [29]. García et al. presented a
mathematical model for geometric modelling based
on the concept of extended simplicial chain (ESC)
which enables to model free-form solids whose
boundaries are free-form surfaces represented by a
set of low degree triangular Bezier patches and
operate with them [30]. Using implicit surfaces,

Dekkers et al. gave a class of blending functions
which share some desirable properties such as
differentiability and intuitive blend control, and
introduced a method to combine CSG modeling with
soft blending [31]. Based on volumetric implicit
functions and physics-based modelling, Hua and Qin
proposed an interactive solid modelling framework,
called the haptics-based dynamic implicit solid
modelling [32].

2. Equations and resolution

PDE based solid modelling has also received some
attention. By solving a second order partial differential
equation, Bloor and Wilson gave some examples of
solid volume representation [33]. Du and Qin proposed
a unified dynamic approach that allows modelers to
define the solid geometry of sculptured objects using
the second-order or fourth-order elliptic PDEs subject
to flexible boundary conditions [34]. In order to
achieve interactive shape representation, manipulation,
and deformation, Du and Qin coupled PDEs with
volumetric implicit functions which have the capability
to reconstruct a complete solid model from partial
information. This facilitates the direct manipulation of
underlying volumetric datasets via sketch curves, isosurface sculpting, deformation of arbitrary interior
regions, as well as a set of CSG operations inside the
working space [35].
In addition, blending of curves and surfaces with
th
n order continuity has been reported. Hartmann
proposed an idea of numerical implicitization of
surfaces for which the determination of a surface
nearpoint is possible as an implicit one whose function
value and gradient of the implicit representation are
only required. With such a treatment, surface/surface
intersection and blending can be solved by powerful
methods available for implicit surfaces [36].
Essentially depending on the parameterizations of the
curves/surfaces to be blended, he introduced a simple
blending method that produces families of
n

continuous blending
parametrically defined, G
curves and surfaces [37]. Based on his previous
n

blending approach of G continuity for parametric
curves, Hartmann also presented a method for

Solid blending is to smoothly connect two solids
together. The solids to be connected are called blended
solids. The solid which connects the blended solids is
called blending solid. The interfaces between the
blended solids and blending solid are called boundary
th

surfaces. For a solid blend with up to the n order
continuity, the blending conditions on the boundary
surfaces can be summarized as

The boundary conditions given in Eq. (1) may be
decomposed into a number of simpler functions. In this
section, we rewrite the boundary condition functions as
the combination of the basic functions that are
elementary functions and their various combinations
excluding polynomials (a polynomial can be divided
into a number of basic functions). Assuming there are
J basic functions in Eq. (1), the boundary condition
functions in terms of these basic functions have the

method to generate blending solids with up to the

As Eq. (12) is a set of linear equations, it can be
solved by any existing numerical algorithms, such as
those given in [39]. Substituting the obtained unknown
constants s ij into Eq. (5), the functions of the blending
solid are achieved.
When n 0 and n 1 , the resolution of Eq. (12) is
so straightforward that we don’t need to use a
numerical method. In the following, we discuss these
two simple cases.
When n in Eq. (1) is set to 0, the positional
continuity at the boundary surfaces is guaranteed and
only the known constants a 0j and a1j exist in Eq. (2).
Accordingly, the unknown constants s 0j and s1j are
required to meet the boundary conditions. From Eqs.
(9) and (12), we found s 0j a 0j and s1j a1j  a 0j .
When n in Eq. (1) takes the value of 1, both
positional and tangential continuities at the boundary
surfaces are satisfied and the unknown constants s 0j ,
s1j , s 2j and s 3j exist in Eqs. (9) and (12). From Eq.

(9), we have s kj

3. Numerical Applications
Firstly, we examine how different orders of
continuity in Eq. (1) affect the blending between two
separate solids, using a simple example. The boundary
conditions for positional continuity only are given by
w 0
x 2u sin 2Sv
y 2u cos 2Sv
z 3
(14)
w 1
x 3u sin 2Sv
y 3u cos 2Sv
z 0
The basic functions are u sin 2Sv for x component,
u cos 2Sv for y component and 1 for z component.

blending solid can be written as

(15)
y 2  wu cos 2Sv
z 3(1  w)
Using Eq. (15), the blending solid is created and
depicted in Fig. 1a. Since there is no tangential
continuity, the abrupt changes at the boundary surfaces
between the blended solids and blending solid can be
clearly observed.
When tangential continuity is required, the
following boundary conditions will be added to Eq.

The blending solid generated is given in Fig. 1b. It
can be seen that with the introduction of the tangential
continuities at both boundary surfaces, the abrupt
changes are removed. The blending solid connects the
blended solids smoothly.
Finally, we consider the blending with up to the 5th
order continuity. For this, the additional boundary
conditions shown below must be added to boundary
conditions (14) and (16).

In Eq. (19), the positional continuity is obtained by
removing all the partial derivatives. And the n th
( n d 3 ) order continuity is reached by taking up to n th
partial derivatives.
The basic functions in Eq. (19) are
g x1 (u , v) u cos(2Sv) , g x 2 (u, v) u sin(12Sv) ,
and
g x 3 (u, v) u cos(24Sv)

4. Conclusions
The degree of smoothness is a crucial constraint for
solid blending. In this paper, we have presented an
effective method to blend solids with any order of
required smoothness.
Using a parametric representation, we describe the
continuity requirement between the blending solid and
blended solids with partial derivatives of any order
across the boundary surfaces, which are included in the
boundary conditions of a blending problem. Then, we
rewrite the boundary conditions with the basic
functions. The mathematical functions of the blending
solid are constructed using the basis functions found in
the boundary conditions. We have discussed how the
unknown functions involved in the blending solid
equations can be determined.
Using this method, we have given as examples a
number of solid blending problems. They demonstrate
clearly the effect of the order of continuity on the
smoothness between the blending and blended solids.
