Abstract
Graph Rotation System is introduced recently as a
new shape modeling method. It can guarantee the 2mainfold property of a mesh while we change the
topology of the mesh, and has the advantage of the
simplicity of creating an artistic graph. A new data
structure Doubly Linked Face List is proposed, which
can implement the operations of graph rotation system
efficiently. However, the original edge operations of it
can not change the number of vertices of a mesh.
Using Point-Sphere, the operations of edge can change
the number, but the efficiency is not high. In this paper,
the edge operations are modified to improve the
efficiency. With this improvement, the algorithm of
Catmull-Clark scheme based on graph rotation system
is given. At the same time, an interactive shape
modeling system based on Graph Rotation System is
given.

1. Introduction
Subdivision has become a valuable tool in
geometric modeling for Computer Graphics (CG) and
Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD), such as
Catmull and Clark [3], and Doo and Sabin [2], Loop
[1]. The control mesh of subdivision scheme must be a
valid 2-manifold, but set operations, which are the
most common modeling method, can not guarantee
that their result closed surfaces are 2-manifold.
Recently, Akleman and Chen have presented a new
shape modeling tool [7] based on Graph Rotation
System [4], which can guarantee the 2-manifold for
meshes. Edmonds [5] has shown that every rotation
system of a graph gives a unique orientable 2dimensional manifold. In order to implement the
topological operations on graph rotation system
efficiently, Chen has introduced a new data structure
Doubly Linked Face List (DLFL) [6], in which all
operations can be run in a linear or O(nlogn) time [6].

Except for its guaranteeing the 2-manifold property, it
is also ease of creating high-genus solids (Figure 7, 8).
Unfortunately, the original edge operations on
graph rotation system could not change the number of
vertices in mesh, but the inserting and deleting edge
operations are dominant in this system. Point-Sphere is
introduced by Akleman to complete the system [9, 10,
11], in which one point-sphere corresponds to one
DLFL structure. However, if we have to insert or
delete a vertex, we have to allocate or de-allocate one
DLFL, which cost much time. In this paper, we modify
the edge operations which improve the efficiency, and
based on the modified operations the design of
Catmull-Clark Subdivsion is far easier.
Akleman et al. have designed Doo-Sabin
subdivision based on graph rotation system [8].
Catmull-Clark subdivision can generalize bicubic
tensor product B-splines, whose continuity is higher
than that of Doo-Sabin. Because of new face points in
Catmull-Clark subdivision, it is difficult to model by
using the original edge operations.
In this paper, we make two major contributions.
Firstly, edge operations are extended by introducing a
single vertex, which can freely modify the topology of
a surface. Secondly, Catmull-Clark subdivision is
designed elaborately using the improved edge
operations.

2. Graph Rotation System
2.1. Graph Rotation System
Let G be a graph (See Figure 1). A rotation of a
vertex a of G is a cyclic permutation of the edge-ends
incident on a. A rotation system of G is a list of
rotations, one for each vertex of G. For an orientable
edge (d, a) and another orientable edge (a, b), vertex b
is the immediate successor of vertex d in the rotation of
vertex a. The result is a permutation on the set of
oriented edges (a’cdb), that is, on the set in which each

undirected edge appears twice, once with each possible
direction. In each edge-orbit under this permutation,
the consecutive oriented edges line up head to tail,
from which it follows that they form a directed cycle in
the graph. If there are r oriented edges in an orbit, then
r-sided polygon can be fitted into it. Fitting a polygon
to every such edge-orbit results in polygons on both
sides of each edge, and collectively the polygons form
a 2-manifold.

2.2. Data Structure: DLFL
DLFL (Doubly Linked Face List) is a modeling
data structure, which is suitable for graph rotation
system. In contrast to DCEL (Doubly Connected Edge

List), DLFL focus on the connectivity among faces.
The definition of DLFL follows:
Let ² (G) denotes the graph embedding of graph
G=(V,E) with face set F. The DLFL of²(G) is a triple
L=<F,V,E>, The number of face list is |F|. Every face
is constructed using a 2-3 tree, and the root of every 23 tree is connected by a doubly cyclic list. There are
|V| items in vertices list, and every item V[v] points to
a sub-node of 2-3 tree of the corresponding faces. The
number of edges is |E|, and each E[e] has two points,
which point to the first vertex in two 2-3 trees of
incident faces respectively (Figure 2 is a DLFL
example of a tetrahedron). Based on the above

structure, the graph rotation system has the following
operations:
FACE-TRACE(f) outputs the adjacent edges of f
according to the rotation.
VERTEX-TRACE(v) outputs the adjacent edges of
v in ordering of the rotation at v.
INSERT(c1, c2, e) inserts an edge between face
corners c1 and c2. This operation can change the
topology of a mesh.
DELETE(e) deletes an edge from the graph
embedding. This is the inverse operation of edge
insertion and is also used in changing topology of a
mesh.
COFACIAL(c1, c2) returns TRUE if two face
corners c1 and c2 are in a same face and FALSE
otherwise.
SUBDIV(e, v) subdivides edge e(u, w) by inserting a
vertex of degree 2 so that the edge becomes two
edges (u, v) and (v, w). This operation can increase
the vertex of a mesh.

3. The Improvement of Edge Operations
From section 2, we know that there are only two
edge operations that can change the topology of a
mesh, but both of them can not change the number of
vertices in a mesh. In practice, a lot of vertices can be
inserted or deleted in every operation. Obviously, the
current topological operation based on graph rotation
system can not complete that efficiently. Based on the
research on Catmull-Clark subdivision, the improved
edge operations can change the number of vertices,
which are convenient in common geometry modeling.

3.1 The Improvement of Edge Inserting
Here we assume that edge e=(v1,v2) will be inserted
between two face corners c1(at vertex v1) and c2(at
vertex v2). Three cases of edge insertion are discussed.
Case 1, c1 and c2 are corners in the same face f. When
edge e is inserted, face f will be split into two faces, but
the topology of the mesh can not be changed. Let us
assume that the vertices list in f is Bf=¢w1v1w1’£
w2v2w2’, where ¢ and £ is sub-set of face f. Two
new vertices list Bf’ = ¢ w1v1v2w2’ and Bf’’= £
w2v2v1w1’ can be constructed when inserting edge e
(Figure 3).In fact, the new faces Bf’ and Bf’’ are
obtained by splitting the vertices list of old face Bf .
Case 2, c1 and c2 belong two different vertices lists ¢
w1v1w1’ and £w2v2w2’ respectivelyˈ where ¢ and
£ is sub-set of two faces. In this case, a bigger face
will be obtained when edge e is inserted (Figure 4). A
handle will be added and the genus of the mesh will

increase one, so the topology of this mesh has been
changed.
Case 3 is the proposed special case. Here we assume
c1 belong to a face Bf˙¢v1ˈwhere ¢ is sub-set of
vertices of f, and v1 is a single vertex of c1, which
corresponds to the node v1 in 2-3 tree of face f and c2
is an isolated vertex v2. In this case vertices list of new
face will be enlarged as¢v1v2v1’ when the edge e is
inserted (Figure 5). Obviously, the operation cannot
change the topology of a mesh, but increase the size of
a mesh.

3.2 The Improvement of Edge Deleting
Actually, deleting an edge is the inverse operation
of inserting an edge. It should be noted that in the third
case the isolated vertex should also be deleted from the
mesh after splitting the vertices list.

3.3 Helper functions
By making use of the improved edge operation, two
helper function SplitFace(Face f, Vertex v) and
MergeFace(Vertex v) have been developed. SplitFace
splits a face into n new faces by inserting an isolated
vertex. MergeFace is the inverse operation of
SplitFace. Both of these two functions are very helpful
when we are designing Catmull-Clark subdivision
scheme.

4. Catmull-Clark subdivision
Catmull-Clark subdivision can generalize bicubic
tensor B-Spline, which is thoroughly analyzed in
computer graphics. The following is some definitions:
New face points: the average of all vertices in a face.
New edge points: the average of the midpoint of the
edge and the average of two adjacent new face points
of the edge.
New vertex points: Q/n+2*R/n+S(n-3)/n, Q is the
average of all incident new face points, R is the
average of all incident new edge points, S is the old
vertex and n is the number of faces around the old
vertex.
Firstly, all of the new points are computed, and then
the new mesh is constructed by the following steps:
1. Connecting the new face points and every new
edge points in each face.
2. For every vertex, connecting the new vertex points
and its adjacent new edge points.
3. Delete the old points and edges.
Based on the DLFL and the improved operations,
Catmull-Clark subdivision is designed:

Step 3: Delete all edges inserted in Step 2 and then get
the final refined mesh (Figure 6(f)).

5. Results and Conclusions
DLFL is suitable for graph rotation system, in which
there are only two operations that can change the
topology of a mesh. Using the improved efficient
operations, it is very easy to model high genus mesh,
which is difficult to construct by the common
modeling method such as set operations. The following
example is built by using our interactive modeling
system (Figure 7).

In Figure 7, a dodecahedron is the initial mesh (Fig.
7(a)), and an isomorphic dodecahedron is copied with
smaller radius and inverse normal direction, then
twelve holes are obtained by inserting five edges in
every corresponding faces (Fig. 7(b)). Catmull-Clark
subdivision is applied to (b) to refine the mesh.
The proposed subdivision scheme and the PointSphere based scheme are both implemented in C++ on
a PC with a 2GHZ Pentium processor with 512M
RAM. A Catmull-Clark subdivision was be done on the
mesh in (c), which has 5120 faces and 2562 vertices.
The time of point-based method and ours are 15.372
seconds and 12.298 seconds, respectively. Obviously,
our method improves a lot on time.
In this paper we improve the efficiency of edge
operations and an efficient Catmull-Clark subdivision
method based on graph rotation system is given.
Further study should be emphasized on the
construction of intuitionistic operations and an
alternative solution for inherent ambiguity
