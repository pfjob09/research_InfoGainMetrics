Abstract
Nowadays, as biology has been taught at
schools for years, the teachers have been facing a
problem on how to get the students to fully understand
the human biology. Of course a student can explain what
a skull is, based on the books that he or she has read, but
does he or she truly know what a skull looks like. Has he
or she touched one? Examine it closely. And not only
that, the current method of teaching biology is too static
and boring. The teachers teach, and the students listen to
it. There has to be some way to change this. The learning
tool that has been developed here is called “Interactive
3D Multimedia Learning Tool in Biology – Skeleton”,
took the advantages from the full-grown potential of
Multimedia and 3D Animations. The main goal of this
CD-ROM platform product is as a tool that will be able
to teach the users what skeleton system is, its functions
and know exactly how the bones look like in a very
dynamic and interactive method. This courseware will
effectively communicate the subject for teachers as well
as students to understand and stimulate their interest in
the teaching and learning process. The MLTB-Skeleton
contains a lot of multimedia elements, such as text,
image, video and audio. But most importantly, MLTBSkeleton also contains interactive 3D models that the
users can interact with. From the point of system
architecture, this system is design with a user friendly
interface that is interesting and easy to understand. Its
main function is to teach the users about the human
skeleton system in an interesting and interactive way.

1. Introduction

explain it in class and showing the skeletal system model
in the biology lab is just not enough to help the student
grasp the and understand what the teacher is trying to
convey. It is just too boring to just sit, listen to the
teacher and look at the pictures either on the projector
screen or on the textbooks.
Although there are some reference book companies
claiming that their notes are complete, effective and
other flowery language to describe their books, the
problem is still there. It’s not interesting. This is where
multimedia comes in play. As we know, multimedia
system refers to the combination of at least 2 of these
media, text, image video, audio, animation, and graphic.
And it must be consisted at lest by a discrete medium
(non-flowing medium like text and graphic) and the
other one is a continuous medium (flowing and playable
medium like audio and video) [13]. Multimedia will
make the learning experience fun and exciting as it
triggers the different senses of a human such as hearing,
and seeing with the various media available.
Moreover, if interactivity is also implemented into
the learning system it will definitely add to the
involvement of the student in the learning process, thus
giving the student easier time understanding what he or
she is learning. For example, in school, the teachers are
always encouraging their students to ask questions
during class. This is intended as a stimulant for the
student to be involved in the learning process in a 2-way
communication with the teacher. With the full blown use
of 3D in almost everything in the media nowadays,
there’s no escaping the need of utilizing 3D in new
educational systems. The students will definitely be
yearning for such engaging and dynamic media such as
3D to add some depth to their traditional studying and
learning method.

One of the factors that contributed to these biology
students is that the teaching method that is used is not
very interesting and compelling to the students. To just

2. Communication and learning process
Technology has always been an indispensable tool
to mankind. The advent of communication technology or
popularly known as information and communication
technologies (ICTs) such as computer, Internet and
cellular phone have opened many avenues to help us in
teaching, learning and leisure. ICT enables teachers to
communicate knowledge on the subject via hearing, sight
and touch. Communication scholars and psychologist
have long reminded us that human beings learn better
through this combination of human senses. For example,
they pointed out that about 11% of learning is through
hearing and another 83% seeing. We tend to remember
about 20% of the messages that we received through
hearing and 50% through a combination of seeing and
hearing.
It can be summarized that learning process will
become more effective if the teaching-learning method
employed is able to stimulate the human senses. ICT has
the value of auditory and sight. The courseware
developed will enable ICT to function effectively and
efficiently. This courseware will assist teachers to
explain clearly as well as demonstrating visually the
subject taught. The students can understand, comprehend
and remember better the subject learned. Thus, learning
process could become more lively, interesting and
innovative through this new learning tool and
courseware.
The teaching of biology requires more than oral
presentation. For example, teachers need to show and
lively exhibit the components of human body. ICT can
assist in extending the communication functions of
explaining, understanding, and create interest among
students on the subject. Therefore, the courseware
developed
must
generate
interest,
perpetuate
understanding and desire among the students to learn
effectively. When using ICT as an educational tool, one
of the basic and pertinent principles is to ensure the
program created is interactive and user-friendly. In other
word, this courseware is easy to use for learning process.
The courseware-developed must incorporate the
principles of effective communication in learning
process. These are the challenges faced by designer and
programmer.

3. Literature review
Humans can process information from different
sensory modalities into one meaningful experience--such
as when they associate the sound of thunder with the
visual image of lightning in the sky. They can also
integrate information from verbal and non-verbal
messages into a mental model--such as when they watch
lightning in the sky and listen to an explanation of the
event. Therefore, the instructional designer is faced with
the need to choose between several combinations of
modes and modalities to promote meaningful learning
[10]. And basically, that is the concept of multimedia.

Mayer and Moreno's [10] study showed that students
who learn with concurrent narration and animations
outperform those who learn with concurrent on-screen
text and animations. It also showed that students who
learn with concurrent narration and animations (physical
integration of on-screen text and visual materials)
outperform those who learn with concurrent on-screen
text and animations.
Multimedia has the potential to bring abstract
concepts and invisible objects and processes to life, and
to do so in a flexible and reliable way which increases
retention and learning [11]. And according to Evans,
“The interactive, user-friendly format and excellent
graphics should improve students' satisfaction and
attention, and their learning outcomes” [3]. This is true,
because with all the elements embedded in it, the
students will surely start to be interested in learning with
it. Multimedia is a generalist field, because anyone and
everyone are doing it, but it may mature into a specialist
field requiring the application of principles that are
becoming established [18], like classroom teaching.
But the reason for the relative rarity of instructional
designers even in universities is that the grant based
ephemeral nature of most employment in universities.
There are few instructional designers to work with us or
to teach us how to best use multimedia at present [4].
And all the skilled workers are working in the private
sector, where there is much pay. Hopefully, this scenario
will change quickly so that multimedia can truly be
implemented in schools and universities.
Hayes and Billy have done a survey of how
comprehensive is learning with multimedia applied.
“Based on a survey of the prior instructional experiences
of instructional staff working in a laboratory setting, we
determined that student learning was often enhanced
when topics were explained using diagrams, models and
other visual aids. The potential educational value of
using well-designed computer-based, interactive
multimedia modules was perceived as one way to
complement traditional laboratory teaching methods”
[5]. In combining written and spoken word with dynamic
pictures, models and animations, the resource should suit
a range of students and learning styles, including the
visually oriented [2].
The use of specific modules to complement other
teaching efforts has been used successfully in a variety of
educational contexts. For example, instructional modules
designed to teach anatomical concepts in a clinical
setting combined with Problem-Based Learning activities
have proven successful [6]. Even though this is done in a
university in America, it’s still proven successful.
There was a study done, examining three media
factors -- namely, text, voice, and computer animation -because using the media in combination is more
consistent with current presentation strategies applied in
today's computer-assisted instruction. Results of the
present study revealed that concurrent use of text, voice,
and animation in an instructional interface resulted in a
significantly better learning outcome when compared to
using animation with text alone or animation with voice

alone. The animation+text+voice design was also the
favorite interface chosen by most of the subjects in this
study.
Many studies investigating animation effects in
learning have focused on a comparison of the learning
effects of computer animation (with or without text) to
static graphics [1], [12], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Some
studies have examined the presentation order between
computer animation and verbal narration [7], [8], [9].

4. Courseware Design
The MLTB-Skeleton is designed as a stand alone
system which will able to operate within the Windows
environment. It contains a lot of multimedia elements as
the main feature of the FDSS, such as image, audio,
video and animation. This system is an interactive
multimedia courseware in itself. The use of all those
multimedia elements is also the reason on why the FDSS
is not being developed as an online system. Because, by
implementing it online, not only will it require a high
bandwidth, it will also increase the time needed to play
the multimedia files like the audio and video file,
therefore reducing the effectiveness of MLTB-Skeleton.
The MLTB-Skeleton operation is based on a simple
and straightforward workflow. This will enable user to
use this system with ease and also avoid any trouble
which might arise with the use of the system, such as
navigation disorientation. The basic process of the
MLTB-Skeleton is shown in the diagram below. This
diagram summarizes the processes which will be done by
the MLTB-Skeleton.

folder (i.e. audio files stored in the ‘Audio’ folder, etc).
The system will then open these media files when the
users called (clicked on a button) for them. The system
can only call a file, and the users cannot store anything in
this system. Therefore, it can eliminate the need of
databases.

4.1. The modules in the courseware
In the MLTB-Skeleton, there are 3 modules that are
presented
 The functions of the skeleton system module
 2 – The human skeleton library module
 3 - Test module

4.2. The functions of the skeleton system module
In this module, the functions of the skeleton system
will be presented. It will range from the ‘What Bones
Are Made Of’ to ‘The Functions of Tendons’. This
module will be presented as a selectable list of topics that
the users can click to bring the user to the page of the
topic that the users have selected. The content will be
presented with all the multimedia elements, such as
audio, video and text.

4.3. The human skeleton library module
This module will show the users what the different
types of bones look like. In this module, an image of a
complete human skeletal system will be displayed to the
users. And when the users slick on a bone, it will take the
users to the menu of the chosen bone. In this page, there
will be a brief description of the said bone, and also the
users can view the interactive 3D model of the bone by
the video provided the screen.

In this module, the users will be tested on their
knowledge of the skeleton system. The users will be
presented with a number of objective questions that the
users have to answer. In the end of the test, the result of
the test will be displayed, and if there are any wrong
answers given by the users, the correct one will be
displayed too.

User interface design is one of the most important
aspects in the process of designing the MLTB-Skeleton.
It had been given a lot of emphasizes in order to ensure
that it is not only well organized and attractive, but also
to give the users an easy time navigating through the
MLTB-Skeleton.

4.6. Process design

The design process of the MLTB-Skeleton is based
on the structured design technique. Structured design
technique is a process centered technique that transforms
the structured analysis model into a good software design
model [19]. It is used to decompose large program into a
hierarchy of smaller modules to ensure easier
implementation and maintenance. Structure chart is use
in this technique to illustrate the system structure.

4.6. Structure chart
Structure chart is a tool that is use in structured
design technique to depict the modules within a system.
It is a tree-like diagram where systems modules are
decompose from top to lower levels of sub modules.The
MLTB-Skeleton is divided into three major components.
The components are the ‘Function of the Skeleton
System’, ‘The Skeleton Library’ and ‘Tests’. The
following Figures show the MLTB-Skeleton’s structure
charts.

Graphics plays an important role in almost every
application nowadays. This is especially true with the
MLTB-Skeleton courseware. To make this courseware
interesting to the target users, the graphics used must be
simple yet beautiful. In this application, all the graphics
are created, and edited with Macromedia Fireworks MX

5. Discussion
In order to fulfill the 3D aspect of this system, the
3D models of the skeletons must first be created. The
modeling process of these bones consumes a huge
amount of time to make sure it resembles real bones, and
not some blocky polygonal boxes. As this is one of the
main features of this system, a lot of emphasis is given
on this aspect. Discreet 3D Studio max was used in the
creation of the models.

5.1 Future enhancements


Implement external database
By implementing an external database, this
courseware would be more effective and
sophisticated where it can keep all the
information of the users. For example, to use
the courseware, the users need to log in first.
And then, the courseware will be able to tell if
the user has read through all the topics in the
classroom module. The courseware will also be

able to keep the record of the user’s quiz results.
Checking which question the users normally got
wrong, or the cumulative percentage of the
questions that the users get right. External
database would also be essential to store the set
of questions where a lot of questions will be
stored in the database, and then be picked
randomly when the users run the quiz module.
That way, the difficulty level of the quiz module
will be higher, and that will facilitate in the
user’s full understanding of the skeleton system.


Broaden the scope of topics
It basically means that the topics included in the
Classroom module will be added with a broader
scope. For example, the diseases concerning the
human skeleton and the treatments for bone
injuries. Not only that it will give the users a lot
more information concerning the human
skeleton, its target user may well be getting
broader. As the original target user for MLTBSkeleton is the secondary school students, after
the new content is added, the more professional
group of users can be introduced to the
courseware, thus making this courseware a
highly informative and educational courseware,
for all user level.



Increase the interactivity level
To increase the interactivity level of the
courseware, a number of things can be done, for
example, creating some kind of game that
requires the knowledge about the skeleton
system to be able to play. For example, a jigsaw
puzzle-like game, that requires the users to put
together some scattered bones to build a
complete human skeleton system. And not
forgetting the control function of all the audio
elements in the courseware. For example, the
voice narration will need a pause, stop and play
button, and the background music will need a
volume control to adjust the volume to the
users’ liking and a mute button to mute the
background music. This will add to the audio
element’s interactivity level.

an innovative approach into the learning process about
the human skeletal system. By using all the multimedia
elements and the principles of effective communication,
it will be able to provide a better understanding on the
human skeletal system. Additionally, it may change the
way people think of the human skeleton system from
something dull and boring to something interesting.

Conclusion
As a conclusion, the Interactive 3D Multimedia
Learning Tool in Biology – Skeleton courseware has
achieved all of its objectives. The courseware will help
the users (teachers and students) understanding the basic
knowledge there is to know about the human skeleton
interactively, using full multimedia and 3D elements.
The user can access the comprehensive and accurate
information in an easy way, with the courseware’s
simple and user-friendly presentation. And the learning
process will be fun and engaging, compared to the
conventional teaching method. This courseware brings
