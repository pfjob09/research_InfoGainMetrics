done some work in direct gear design for automotive
applications. Computer aided design of elliptical gears has
been studied by Bair [8] while Xianying et al. [9] are more
focused on the study of design principle of the LogiX gear
tooth profile and the selection of its inherent basic
parameters.
This paper begins with some background and notations
followed by the explanation of B√©zier-like cubic function.
Then, the proposition of an S-shaped and C-shaped
transition curves will be shown in the next section. The
description of product design using the algorithm proposed
will be described and finally, the conclusion and several
recommendations will be made for future work.

Abstract
This paper proposes a design technique using an Sshaped and C-shaped transition curves. A simple algorithm
will be proposed in this paper where this algorithm will be
based on Habib and Sakai [1]. In order to use this
algorithm, a few constraints are considered such as the
continuity, control points, curvature, radius etc. In this
paper, we will apply this algorithm to design a spur gear
tooth and vase in the two and three dimensional. The
function involved is B√©zier like cubic function with the
smoothness is G2 continuity.

1. Introduction

2. Background and Notations

A transition curve has been used in many applications
especially in engineering field, for example in road design
or in railway design. This curve defines a curve where an
accomplish gradual transition from the straight to circular
curve with the curvature changes from zero to finite value.
This transition curve also provide a medium for gradual
introduction or change of required super elevation and a
curve where can change curvature in compound and
reverse awe cases, so that the gradual change the curvature
introduced by curve to curve.
In addition, the transition curve also can be seen as a
curve where the radius at a point on the curve changes
gradually along the curve. The main focus in this paper is
to develop a simple algorithm of using an S-shaped and Cshaped transition curves between two circles and this
algorithm will be applied to product design where in spur
gear tooth and vase designs. Many researchers have been
done in this area such as Walton and Meek [2, 3] have
discussed a planar cubic B√©zier spiral and planar G2
transition between two circles with a fair cubic B√©zier
curve while Habib and Sakai [4] are explained the G2 cubic
transition between two circles with shape control, Yeoh
and Ali [5] summarized a cubic B√©zier-like spiral as
transition curve, Sheveleva et al. [6] who have proposed
algorithms for analysis of meshing and contact of spiral

vectors, A and B are written as A¬∑B.
A planar parametric curve is defined by a set of points,
z (t ) ( x (t ), y (t )) with t in some given interval of the real
line. In this paper, we will use t ¬è [0,1]. The cross product

where P0 , P1 , P2 , P3 are the control points and O 0 , O1 are
the parameters controlling the shape of the curve. In this
paper, the value of O 0 , O1 ¬è ( 0,3) to guarantee the B√©zier
like cubic function is positive. The next section will
discuss an S-shaped transition curve using the B√©zier like
cubic curve.

In C-shaped transition curve, we propose a method to
find a single C-shaped curve. In order to do that, we

Manufacturers or designers usually use an involute
curve to design a spur gear tooth. This curve is generated
by tracing point method for creating a curve. In this paper,

the application of S-shaped transition curve that can design
a spur gear tooth.
Let assume the radius of pitch circle, r p 1 and the

In Figure 8, we have four segments to produce a gear
train. From this finding, we know that an S-shaped
transition curve can give an alternative method for creating
a spur gear tooth which is different from the usual method.
As a comparison to an involute curve, an S-shaped
transition curve is a simple method where the curve can be
directly generated in order to give a faster generated curve

8. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, another design technique has been
proposed in product design especially in spur gear tooth
and vase. This research shows that the application of the
transition curve can be used in designing a product. The
alternative method of using an S-shaped transition curve
has also been shown to design the spur gear tooth. Once all
the visualizations have been done, we are interested to
simulate the gear system from our findings. After this, the
gear analysis will be carried out to see the improvement of
the gear system.
