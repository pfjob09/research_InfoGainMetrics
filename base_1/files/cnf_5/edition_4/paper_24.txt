Abstract
The authors have already proposed a cloth design system that
provides intuitive operations, e.g., sewing, cutting and fitting a
cloth in a virtual 3D space through direct manipulations using
a force-feedback device, Phantom. However, a Phantom
device is very expensive and it is difficult for the end user to
buy and use it. Also, many users are familiar with the use of a
mouse device rather than that of a Phantom device. So, the
authors extended their cloth design system to support a
standard mouse device besides a Phantom device. They also
evaluated the usefulness of their cloth design system by asking
some subjects to try to practically perform several operations
using a Phantom device and a mouse device. Then it is found
that even using a mouse device, their cloth design system is
practically useful. This paper shows evaluation results and
discusses about them, and clarifies the usefulness of the cloth
design system that only supports a mouse device.

1. Introduction
Recent advances of computer hardware technologies
make it possible to create 3D CG images and 3D CG
animations in real time. On the other hand, as results of
virtual reality researches, various types of virtual reality
peripherals were proposed and most of them exist as
commercial products. In this situation, using these
technologies and peripherals, we can develop virtual
reality applications those provide an immersive virtual
environment where the user operates 3D objects
intuitively as if he/she existed in the real world.
However, although a lot of cloth simulation algorithms
and systems have been proposed and developed so far,
there had not been any cloth design system that provides
intuitive operations for effectively sewing, cutting nor
fitting a cloth using a force-feedback device. Hence, we
have been developing such a cloth design system with
which the user operates a cloth in a virtual 3D space as if
he/she operated in the real world. We have already
proposed a cloth design system that provides the user
with intuitive operations like sewing, cutting a cloth, and
fitting it on the body of a 3D character using a Phantom
device [1]. This cloth design system also provides a
collaborative environment that allows two users to
perform the operations collaboratively through the

Internet using a Phantom device [2]. However, a
Phantom device is not popular rather than a standard
mouse device and many users are familiar with the use of
a mouse device rather than that of a Phantom device. So,
we wandered our cloth design system is practically
useful or not. So, this time, we extended our cloth
design system to support a mouse device besides a
Phantom device and evaluated its usefulness by asking
some subjects to try to practically perform several
operations using a Phantom device and a mouse device.
Then we found a mouse device is enough for some
operations and totally our cloth design system that only
supports a mouse device is also practically useful. In this
paper, we report such new findings.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes related work and Section 3 shows the
system overview. We explain the operations provided by
the system for the cloth design in Section 4 and show
some performance evaluation results in Section 5. In
Section 6, we report new findings about the usefulness of
intuitive operations using a mouse device and using a
Phantom device. Finally we conclude the paper in
Section 7.

2. Related work
Many researches on the cloth simulation have been done
[3]. As one of the techniques for the cloth simulation,
there is a geometric technique [4]. Recently, physically
based cloth simulation is used for realistic graphics and
animations [5, 6, 7]. However, these techniques are
difficult to run in real time. For the real-time cloth
simulation, a B-spline surface based haptic sculpting
system is proposed [8]. By controlling a small number
of control points on a surface of a cloth, the system
simulates the cloth in real time. As similar approach to
this, a particle-based cloth simulation is proposed [9]. By
controlling a small number of particles, cloth behavior is
simulated at a high speed. From the viewpoint of the
cloth design interface, there are some research systems.
For example, Igarashi, et al., proposed a system [10] that
provides intuitive operations for fitting and moving a
cloth interactively using a 2D input device. Keckeisen,
et al. proposed a Virtual Dressmaker [11]. This system
allows the user to intuitively select and to drag parts of
cloths in a VR environment built by a special hardware

set. However, it does not allow to cut or to sew cloths.
We could not find any cloth design system that not only
provides intuitive operations proposed in this paper but
also supports both of a Phantom device and a mouse
device. In this paper, we propose such a cloth design
system.

3. System overview
Figure 1 shows a screen snapshot of the system when the
user pulling up an edge of a cloth. Besides the cloth,
there is a 3D character represented as polygonal mesh
models. Our system employs a Mass-Spring model for
the cloth simulation [1]. Firstly, the user wraps a 3D
character in a cloth in the gravity field. This operation
requires any collision detection mechanism. We use an
OBB-tree [12] for the rapid collision detection. The
OBB-tree is a tree hierarchy of oriented bounding boxes
(OBBs). After wrapping the 3D character, the user
performs any operations on the cloth to design it. We
prepare several operations, i.e., pulling, cutting, sewing,
and painting/drawing, those can be performed using a
force-feedback device, Phantom or a mouse device. The
system also allows two users to perform these operations
collaboratively through the Internet.

exerted on the Phantom pointer by that nearest vertex.
By this operation, the user can pull any vertex of a cloth.
However, there is a problem that its computational cost
is very heavy and the operation cannot be performed in
real time. To deal with this problem, we decided to
apply dynamics equation written in the paper [1] to a
small number of vertices those are located in a small area
around the Phantom/mouse pointer to reduce the
computational cost.
Other operations are also
implemented in the same way. In this way, only a local
area of the cloth can be pulled up by the pulling
operation. If the user wants to move the whole cloth, the
pulling operation is insufficient. We implemented
another operation that allows the user to move a whole
cloth as shown in Figure 3. All vertices are moved with
the Phantom/mouse pointer simultaneously.

the proposed cloth design system.

4. Operations for cloth design
Based on the Mass-Springs model [10], four operations
are available using a Phantom device or a mouse device,
i.e., pulling, cutting, sewing, and painting/drawing a
cloth in a virtual 3D space.

4.1. Pulling and moving operations
In the pulling operation, if the user pushes a button of the
Phantom device or a mouse device, the Phantom/mouse
pointer comes to connect to its nearest neighboring
vertex of the cloth through an additional spring as shown
in Figure 2, then, a spring force is exerted on each vertex
and increased according to the distance from the
Phantom/mouse pointer. If the user uses a Phantom
device, simultaneously the user feels a feedback force

4.2. Cutting and sewing operations
Figure 4 shows an example of the cutting and sewing
operations. In the cutting operation, the Phantom/mouse
device is used to indicate two adjacent vertices, one of
them (a red vertex of the left part) will be divided into
two new vertices (red vertices of the right part) and the
edge between them will be divided into two new edges.
In the sewing operation, if the user pulls a vertex and
move it to another destination vertex, these two vertices
(red vertices of the right part) will be merged into one
vertex (a red vertex of the left part). When this operation
is performed, if an adjacent vertex of the pulled vertex
and an adjacent vertex of the destination vertex are
coincident (a yellow vertex of the right part), the
corresponding two edges are also merged into one edge.

In these ways, the cutting and sewing operations are
performed. Figure 5 shows a screen snapshot of actual
cutting and sewing operation results.

lower right part is a cut part from a cloth and this part
was sewn on the upper left part of the cloth.

4. 3. Painting/Drawing operation
The system also provides a painting/drawing operation
that allows the user to paint/draw a picture or texts on the
surface of a cloth freely using the Phantom/mouse device
based on the texture mapping technology. In this
operation, the Phantom/mouse pointer is used to indicate
the location of a virtual pen or a virtual brush. If the use
uses a Phantom device, during the operation, whenever
the Phantom pointer touches a cloth, the user feels the
touching feeling by a feedback force of the Phantom
device in the same direction as the normal vector of its
corresponding vertex. In Figure 5, we drew “JAPAN” on
the surface of the cloth.

5. Performance evaluation
In this section, we present experimental results of the
cloth design actually we performed. We performed the
following operations 1) to 4), and Figures 6 1) to 4) are
screen
snapshots of corresponding operations
respectively.
1 ) Wrap a 3D character in clothes using an gravity effect.
2 ) Cut and remove unnecessary parts of the cloths.
3 ) Sew several edges of the clothes.
4 ) Paint a picture on a surface of the cloth

Figure 7: Cloth fitting to a 3D character.
Finally we obtained a cloth like shown in Figure 7 by
performing the above operations.
We measured a computation time of every operation
on a standard PC with Windows XP Professional OS, a
2.54 GHz Pentium IV processor, 1.5 GB memory, and a
GeForce 6800GT Graphics board. See Table 1. There
are two rendering modes, i.e., with rendering lines and
vertices, and without rendering lines and vertices.
Rendering lines and vertices is necessary information for
getting a topology of the cloth. However, when the
number of vertices becomes more than 521, its frame
rate becomes too low to operate in real time. To reduce
the computational cost, we modified the system to make
it to render only lines and vertices in a small region
around the Phantom/mouse pointer as shown in Figure 8.
This is the same idea as that of calculating the dynamics
equation about a small number of vertices located in a
small area around the Phantom/mouse pointer explained
in Section 4.1. Table 1 shows frame rate of every
operation in the local region rendering. In this case, even
if the number of vertices is over 521, the user can operate
the cloth in real time because the frame rate is kept to be
over 10 fps. Besides the advantage to reduce the
computational cost, the local region rendering of lines
and vertices has another advantage that it makes the user
more easily understands a position of the

Phantom/mouse pointer and hence more easily operate
the cloth.

6. User evaluation
We compared the usefulness of a Phantom device with
that of a mouse device about four main operations, i.e.,
moving, cutting and sewing a cloth, and
painting/drawing on a cloth. We asked some subjects to
practically perform four tasks corresponding to the four
main operations and consult with them about how ease
each task can be performed by using each of a Phantom
device and a mouse device. In the following subsections,
we show such evaluation results and discuss about them.

From the mean values of intuitiveness/easiness and the
mean spent time, it is found that the use of a Phantom
device is better than that of a mouse device as for this
task.
(2) Second task is the cutting of a cloth along the curved
line drawn on the cloth as shown in Figure 10. The left
and right parts of the figure are before and after the task.
Table 4 shows intuitiveness and easiness of this task, and
Table 5 shows spent time for the task of each subject.

6.1 Evaluation results
We collected intuitiveness, easiness and spent time for
each task by consulting with the subjects. The number of
subjects is six and they are all familiar with the PC
operation.
(1) First task is the moving of cloths as shown in Figure
9. This task is consisting of two steps, i.e., Step1: moving
four cloth objects to make them laid out as shown in the
right part of the figure from their original positions as
shown in the left part, and Step2: a reverse task of Step1.
Table 2 shows intuitiveness and easiness of this task, and
Table 3 shows spent time (second) for the task of each
subject. Intuitiveness and easiness is scored by an
integer number of one to five. Five means good and one
means bad.

From the mean values of intuitiveness/easiness and the

device is a little better than that of a Phantom device as
for this task.

From the mean values of easiness and the mean spent
time, it is easily found that the use of a mouse device is
better than that of a Phantom device as for this task.
However, from the mean value of intuitiveness, it is said
that a Phantom device is more intuitive rather than a
mouse device as for this task.
(4) Final task is the drawing of Japanese kanji characters
on a cloth as shown in Figure 12. The left and right parts
of the figure are before and after the task. Table 8 shows

From the mean values of intuitiveness and the mean
spent times, it is easily found that the use of a Phantom
device is more suitable for this task than that of a mouse
device although the mean value of easiness of a mouse
device is a very little better than that of a Phantom device.

6.2 Discussion
Table 10 shows mean values of intuitiveness, easiness
and spent time for all the above tasks of a Phantom
device and a mouse device. It also shows mean values of
spent time for another Task5. This task is a combination
of several operations as shown in Figure 13.

From the contents of Table 10, we can conclude as
follows: although a Phantom device provides intuitive
operations, a mouse device is easier rather than a
Phantom device totally because a mouse device needs

less spent time than a Phantom device especially for the
cutting and sewing operations. So, a mouse device is
said to be enough and useful as an input device of our
proposed cloth design system. The one reason for this is
that a mouse device is very popular as a pointing device
for a standard PC and we are all familiar with its
operations. Although we found that a mouse device is
enough for our cloth design system, a Phantom device is
absolutely suitable for operations like moving an object
and changing a view point because these kinds of
operations needs six degrees of freedom and a Phantom
device has six DOF. As well, a Phantom device is
suitable for a pulling operation because the feed-back
force is important for its intuitiveness.

7. Concluding remarks
We have already proposed a cloth design system that
provides intuitive operations, pulling, cutting, sewing
and painting/drawing, performed using a haptic device
like Phantom. However, a Phantom device is very
expensive and it is not popular rather than a mouse
device. So, we extended our cloth design system to
support a mouse device besides a Phantom device, and
we evaluated its usefulness by asking some subjects to
practically perform several operations using both a
Phantom device and a mouse device. From the user
evaluation results, we found that a mouse device is
totally enough as an input device of our cloth design
system in comparison with a Phantom device. Of course,
a Phantom device is absolutely suitable for some specific
operations. Anyway, there is no problem because our
cloth design system supports both a Phantom device and
a mouse device.
We employed a Mass-Spring model for the cloth
deformation simulation [1]. However, it needs much
computational cost so that it is impossible for real-time
operations when the number of vertices of a cloth is very
large.
We have to employ more efficient cloth
simulation model to reduce the computational cost.
There are some commercial software packages for
apparel industry [13-16]. Those software packages
provide designers with various functionalities
necessitated for practically creating garments besides
intuitive operations provided by our system. We have to
prepare such functionalities to make our system more
practically useful.
