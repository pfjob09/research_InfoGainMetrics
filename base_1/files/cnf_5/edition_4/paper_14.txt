Abstract
Rapidly advancing technologies and the increasing
role of computers give the computer game boundless
potential for the future. Among the various game
industries, the console game industry in particular has
attracted significant attention, bringing the importance
of sound and music to the forefront. Game music was
traditionally used for sound effects to prevent user
boredom. As gaming developed, so did audio, being
utilized for numerous purposes. As gaming platforms
increased in power and complexity, audio, which was
once limited to simple beeps, started to play a larger role,
becoming Back Ground Music (BGM) having quality at
par with that of films. This paper discusses the evolution
of video game console audio specifications and
hardware, from simple 8-bit machines to future
directions in the development of audio generators for
game sound & music.
Keywords--- Game Sound, Music, Interactive, Audio,
Game Trends

1. Introduction
Rapid improvements on game platform capabilities,
have produced diverse game techniques and genres,
requiring game sound & music that effectively express
the genre characteristics and enhance the game
experience. Due to the unique characteristics and
technical limitations of the platform, each game platform
requires its own mode of music, with different game
genres needing their own kind of music.
This paper discusses the roots of game console audio,
chronicles its evolution into the powerful driving force it
is today, and challenges sound designers to take the next
step in its growth.

2. 8-bit Machines & Chip music

predating the Atari PONG home consoles by several
years (Figure 1) [16] [22] .

Figure 1 Magnavox Odyssey Ping-Pong

The Odyssey lacked sound capability, something
that was corrected with the "PONG systems" several
years later, which included Magnavox's own Odysseylabeled Pong consoles [12] [15] [16] [22] .
2.2 Pong: Atari, 1975
PONG is based on the sport of table tennis, and
named after the sonar-blip sound generated by the
circuitry when the ball is hit (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Pong for Home, Atari

2.3 Channel F: Fairchild, 1976

Figure 3 Channel F System II

The sound Channel F was played through an internal
speaker, rather than the TV set, using 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and
1.5 kHz tones (Figure 3). These frequencies could be
modulated quickly to produce different tones. There
were major changes in the unit design; the sound was
mixed into the TV signal, the unit no longer needed a
speaker [12] [22] .
2.4 Atari 2600: Atari, 1977

2.1 Magnavox: Odyssey, 1972
The Magnavox Odyssey was the world’s first video
game console [9] [15] . It was released in the fall of 1972,

The Pokey was a digital I/O chip found in the Atari
8-bit family of home computers and many arcade games
in the 1980s (Figure 4) [24] . The Pokey was also well
known for its sound effect and music generation
capabilities, producing a distinctive square wave sound
popular among chip tune aficionados. The design of the
Pokey made it possible for games to have polyphonic
music and sound effects of up to four channels. The Atari
2600, which utilized the Pokey, was capable of
generating only two tones, or ‘notes’, at a time [11] . One
of the sound engines developed for the Atari 8-bit family
was called the Advanced Music Processor (AMP) engine
[22] [23] .

machine, with the state being set up in a series of sixteen
8-bit registers. These were programmed over an 8-bit bus
that was used both for addressing and data by toggling
one of the external pins. The 8910 and its variants
became popular chips in many arcade games, and was
used on, among others, the Intellivision and Vectrex
video game consoles and the MSX, Atari ST, Amstrad
CPC, Oric 1 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128/+2/+3 home
computers as well as the Mocking board sound card for
the Apple II family [2] [27] .
2.8 Family Computer : Nintendo, 1983

2.5 Oddissey 2: Magnavox, 1978
One of the remarkable points of the Oddissey2 system
was its brilliant speech synthesis unit, which was
released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound
effects enhancement [12] . The speech synthesis of the
Odyssey 2 may be remembered for pioneering the fusion
of board and video games. There was only one Intel 8244
custom IC chip in the system, which performed both
mono audio and video functions, 24-bit shift register,
clockable at 2 frequencies, noise generator [22] .
2.6 Intellivision: Mattel, 1979

Figure 5 Intellivision, Mattel

In 1983 Mattel introduced a new peripheral
innovation for the time (Figure 5): Intellivoice, a voice
synthesis device which produced speech when used with
certain games, most of which would not work without
the add-on component [4] [25] . The Intellivoice Voice
Synthesis Module was an adapter for the Intellivision
platform, Mattel's home gaming console that utilized
voice synthesizers to generate audible speech. The
Intellivoice was a large, brown cartridge that could be
plugged into the Intellivision, at which point games
specifically designed for the device could be inserted like
a normal cartridge into the right side of the module [22] .
2.7 Vectrex: 1983

Figure 6 Vectrex, AY-8912 and Mocking board

The Vectrex generated sound and music directly or
by use of the AY-8912 sound chip (Figure 6). It was a 3voice programmable sound generator (PSG) designed by
General Instrument, initially for use with their 16-bit
CP1610 or one of the PIC1650 series of 8-bit
microcomputers. The 8910 was essentially a state

Figure 7 NES & FamiCom, Nintendo

The Famicom had five sound channels (Figure 7),
featuring:
 2 pulse-wave channels, variable duty, 16-level
volume control, hardware pitch-bend support,
supporting frequencies from 54 Hz to 28 kHz.
 1 triangle-wave channel, fixed volume, supporting
frequencies from 27 Hz to 56 kHz
 1 white-noise channel, 16-level volume control,
supporting two modes at 16 preprogrammed
frequencies
 1 delta pulse-code modulation (DPCM) channel with
6 bits of range, using 1-bit delta encoding at 16
preprogrammed sample rates from 4.2 kHz to 33.5
kHz, also capable of playing standard PCM sound
by writing individual 7-bit values at timed intervals
[22] [28] .

3 Synthesis & Sampling
3.1 Master System: SEGA, 1986

Figure 8 Master System, SEGA

The Japanese Master System (Figure 8) included the
YM2413 FM sound chip, called OPLL, a cost-reduced
sound chip manufactured by Yamaha Corporation and
based on their YM3812 (OPL2). To make the chip
cheaper to manufacture, many of the internal registers
were removed. The result of this is that the YM2413 can
only play one user-defined instrument at a time; the other
15 instrument settings are hard-coded and cannot be
altered by the user. There were other cost-cutting
modifications: the number of waveforms was reduced to
two, and an adder is not used to mix the channels;
instead, the chip's DAC (Digital to Analog Converter)
plays each channel one after the other, and the output of
this is usually passed through an analog filter. The

YM2413 was used as a sound expansion on the MSX
and the SG-1000 Mark III [22] .
3.2 PC Engine : NEC, 1987

Figure 9 PC-Engine First Model & TurboGrafx-16

The PC Engine (PCE) (Figure 9) has three main
chips in it: CPU + sound, graphics processor, and video
encoder. It has 6 PSG audio channels, programmable
through the HuC6280A CPU [22] . The CDROM
attachments (all of them) include a new ADPCM sound
chip and some extra RAM for playing sound samples.
This RAM is not the same as normal PCE RAM, and
was designed to be used with the new sound chip
exclusively. Through smart programming, the game
‘Monster Lair’ used this RAM to store extra sprite
animation, essentially bypassing the RAM limitations of
the PCE and System Card. This was probably the first
and only time that new sound hardware increased
graphics quality. Interestingly, this affected emulation as
well, as Monster Lair suddenly looked better when this
sound chip was accurately emulated [9] [22] [31] .
3.3 Mega Drive: SEGA, 1988

Figure 10 Mega Drive, SEGA & YM2612 chip

The Mega Drive (Figure 10) has two sound chips,
one is the main sound chip (YAMAHA YM2612), and
the other is the secondary sound chip (Texas Instruments
SN76489) [22] [26] . The main sound chip has six FM
channels, with four operators each; channel 6 can be
used for PCM data or as a regular channel. The chips are
programmable oscillators of low-frequency and stereo
panning [32] . The secondary sound chip has four
channels had a Programmable Sound Generator. Three
square wave channels and one white noise channel. The
main sound chip had programmable tone, noise and
attenuation. This was used for master system
compatibility mode as well as to supplement FM. It has a
different random noise generation compared to a real
SN76489, SN76489A chip [12] [22] [32] .
3.4 Super Nintendo Entertainment System, 1990

Figure 11 SNES, Nintendo

Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation (CGIV 2007)
0-7695-2928-3/07 $25.00 © 2007

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
(Figure 11) had a sound controller chip: an 8-bit Sony
SPC700 CPU for controlling the DSP chips
independent of the main SNES CPU. The main CPU
communicates with this sound controller through a set
of four memory-mapped registers [22] [33] [34] . It
featured a second order low-pass filter, one for each
channel, for improved quality of low-frequency (bass)
tones. A Pulse Code Modulator: 16-bit Adaptive
Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM)
Although the SNES is normally only able to output
stereo sound, a few games (such as Jurassic Park and
Super Turrican) used Dolby Pro-Logic to create
surround sound embedded in the stereo sound signals
[33] [34] [35] .
3.5 SEGA Saturn: 1994

Figure 12 Saturn & Custom Sound Processor

The Saturn Custom Sound Processor (SCSP) is
manufactured by Yamaha and consists of several
components (Figure 12). The SCSP is a multi-function
game sound generator LSI that consists of a PCM sound
generator and DAC (Digital to Analog Converter). The
SCSP creates and processes sound mixes. It contains a
32-slot sound generator and sound effect DSP, a 16channel digital mixer and timer, and an interrupt
controller [36] .

4 Pre-Recorded & Streaming Music
4.1 Streaming Music
Home console systems also developed specialized
streaming formats, ADPCM sources with up to 24
channels and up to 44.1 kHz sampling rate and
containers for compressed audio playback [18] [22] .
Games would take full advantage of this ability,
sometimes with highly praised results [4] [7] . This
overall freedom offered to music composers gave video
game music the equal footing with other popular music it
had lacked. A musician could now, with no need to learn
about programming or the game architecture itself,
independently produce the music to their satisfaction
[15] [16] . This flexibility would be exercised as popular
mainstream musicians used their talents for video games
specifically [5] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .
4.2 Play Station and PSF: 1994

Figure 13 Playstation, Sony

A Portable Sound Format (PSF) file is a sound data
file (from the Nintendo Entertainment System, and other
console related sound formats) ripped directly from
video games from a variety of game consoles. The
format was originally used for Sony PlayStation video
games (Figure 13). Generally PSF files contain a number
of samples and a sequence player program. This takes far
less space than the equivalent streamed format of the
same song while still sounding exactly like the original
song [3] [7] [38] .
PSF initially stood only for "PlayStation Sound
Format", but with the addition of the PSF2, SSF (Sega
Saturn Sound Format), DSF (Dreamcast Sound Format),
USF (Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format), QSF (Capcom
Q-Sound Format), and GSF (Game Boy Advance Sound
Format) sub formats, the more generic acronym
"Portable Sound Format" was developed [7] [38] .
4.3 Nintendo64: 1996

Figure 14 Nintendo 64

The Nintendo 64's graphics and audio duties are
performed by the 64-bit SGI co-processor, named the
"Reality Co-Processor" (Figure 14). The RSP frequently
performs audio functions. It can playback virtually any
type of audio including uncompressed PCM, MP3, MIDI,
and tracker music. The RSP is capable of a maximum of
100 channels of PCM at a time, but this is with 100%
system utilization for audio. It has a maximum sampling
rate of 48 kHz with 16-bit audio. However, there were
storage limitations caused by the cartridge format’s
limited audio size (and thus quality).
4.4 Dreamcast: 1998
The Dreamcast had the sound engine of Yamaha
AICA Sound Processor (Figure 15): 22.5 MHz 32-Bit
ARM7 RISC CPU: 45 MHz, 64 channel PCM/ADPCM
sampler (4:1 compression), XG MIDI support, and 128
step DSP [7] [9] .

4.5.1 Sony PlayStation 2: March, 2000
The PS2 console (Figure 16 a.) made significant
technological advances from its predecessor. In addition
to quadrupling its graphical processing capabilities, the
PS2 also doubled the original PlayStation’s 24-channel
sound chip to a 48-channel system. The PS2 also
expanded sound barriers by creating an internal sound
processor that existed independent from graphics
processors to keep from having to share its resources
with visual graphics, which historically have garnered
greater emphasis and devoted CPU memory.
The PS2’s independent sound processor opened new
doors for sound designers [15] [16] . Audio artists
designing for the PS2 could implement techniques with
fewer restrictions, having the opportunity to preserve
high quality audio, incorporate longer loops, larger sound
samples, more processing and modeling capabilities, and
48 independent voices that can be streamed
simultaneously in stereo sound [18] .
4.5.2 Nintendo GameCube: September, 2001
Similar to the PS2, the GameCube (Figure 16 b.) is
also capable of 48kHz quality stereo or surround sound,
but has a digital signal processor (DSP) that supports
more than 100 voices, and can play up to 64 real-time 3D
voices at one time. The beauty of the GameCube, from a
sound composer designer’s standpoint, is that there is no
need for a development kit to create audio for Nintendo
games.
Music and sound effects can be produced in
whatever method the sound artists see fit, and can be
implemented and easily inserted into the game by the
programmer using Nintendo’s audio tool called MusyX.
Audio designers developing for GameCube titles can
create and apply components of different sounds
separately, and then have them played back at random,
which can then be layered according to events, ultimately
allowing for more interactivity.
4.5.3 Microsoft Xbox: November, 2001

Figure 15 Dreamcast

The sound chip was just as good as any of the sound
cards on the market during that period. It offered 64
simultaneous audio channels at 16-bit, 44.1 kHz as well
as XG MIDI support. 2MB of RAM was also available
for storing both sound effects, and wave table instrument
samples [3] [7] [9] [22] .
4.5 PlayStation 2, XBox & GameCube: 2000~1

Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation (CGIV 2007)

The Xbox’s (Figure 16 c.) audio data unit is the
Media Communications Processor (MCP), which
includes four independent audio processors for digital
audio and 3D positioning; the set-up engine, Voice
Processor (VP), Global Processor (GP), and Encode
Processor (EP). The processors each perform a specific
function to ensure high quality digital audio. Unique to
Microsoft is DirectMusic Producer, a composition tool
used in conjunction with DirectX 8 audio scripting,
Down Loadable Sound (DLS) and Windows Media
software for creating and programming game sound [13]
[14] . DirectMusic Producer is a program that can be
used to generate interactive audio [5] [6] [7] . The Xbox

had a definite edge in the audio department in that it was
the first console with the ability to incorporate in-game
Dolby Digital surround, as well as the capability of
communicating 256 simultaneous stereo voices through
64 discrete channels. The Xbox created a far superior
auditory experience to that of the PlayStation 2 or
GameCube.

5 Game Consoles at Present

5.1 Microsoft Xbox 360: November, 2005
All games made for the Xbox 360 (Figure 17 a.) are
required to support at least 5.1-channel Dolby Digital
surround sound. The console works with over 256 audio
channels and 320 independent decompression channels
using 32-bit processing for audio, with support for 48
kHz 16-bit sound, hardware codec streaming. Sound files
for games are encoded using Microsoft's XMA audio
format.
5.2 Sony PlayStation 3: November, 2006
Future technology does not represent any
fundamental shift in video game music creation for Sony.
The PlayStation 3 (Figure 16 b.) handles multiple types
of surround sound technology, including Dolby TrueHD,
and DTS-HD.
5.3 Nintendo Wii: November, 2006
Nintendo's Wii console (Figure 16 c.) shares many
audio components with the Nintendo GameCube from
the previous generation, including Dolby Pro Logic II.
These features are extensions of technology already
currently in use.

6. Game music as a genre
Many of the discussed consoles and other early
game systems featured a similar style of music which
may come closest to being described as the "video game
genre" in terms of musical composition, as opposed to
simply "video game music" for being in a video game,
this genre is increasing in popularity, being played by
live orchestras and bands in concerts [30] . Some
compositional features of this genre continue to influence
certain music today, though game soundtracks currently
tend to emulate movie soundtracks more-so than this
classic genre [37] . This genre's compositional elements
may have developed due to technological restraints. The
genre might also have been influenced by techno-pop
bands such as Yellow Magic Orchestra, which were quite
popular during the period in which videogame music
took its trademark sound [9] [11] [17] .

Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation (CGIV 2007)

Songs feature a heavy amount of synchronization
between instruments, in a way that would be difficult for
a human to play. For example, although the tones
featured in NES music can be thought of emulating a
traditional four piece rock band (triangle wave used as a
bass, two pulse waves analogous to two guitars, and an
affected white noise channel used for drums), and
although video game music was influenced by rock or
pop music at the time, composers would often go out of
their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of
notes. This has been compared to music composition
during the baroque period, where it is believed that
composers compensated for instruments such as the
harpsichord
by
focusing
more
on
musical
embellishments. Composers were also limited in terms of
polyphony, or the number of notes that can be played at
once. Only three notes can be played at once on the
Nintendo Entertainment System. A great deal of effort
was put into creating the illusion that more notes are
playing. As of the late 1990s, musical groups covering
these melodies have sprung up. One such group is The
Minibosses, who attempt to emulate these melodies as
closely as possible using real instruments [19] . Another
such group is the NESkimos, who opt to explore these
songs artistically, and create entirely new songs out of
them. And also Brazilian heavy metal band, MegaDriver
[20] [21] .

7. Current Developments
Today, the game developer has many choices on
how to develop game audio. More likely, changes in
video game music creation will have very little to do
with technology and more to do with other factors of
game development as a business whole. As sales of
video game music separate from the game itself become
increasingly marketable(compared to Japan where game
music CDs had been selling for years), business elements
also wield a level of influence where it had little before
[9] [11] [22] . Game sound engineers from outside the
game developer's immediate employment, such as music
composers, sound designers, recording & mixing
engineers, voice actors and pop artists, have been
contracted to produce game sound and music just as they
would for a theatrical movie [8] [22] .
Many other factors have a growing influence, such
as demanding consumers, one source multi use(OSMU)
for content, politics on some level of the development,
executive input and various other elements [1] [29] .

8. Conclusion
The role of game audio depends on the content,
progressive manner and mood of the game, defined by its
requirements for sound and music with characteristics
that produce an immersive atmosphere according to the
game storyline. The characteristics of game audio, which
fully engage the attention of the user, have been analyzed
in terms of technological limitations. The game sound
market has dramatically changed from that of 10 years

past, instrumentation was simpler then by comparison.
Rarely would composers have more than 9 to 11 voices
of polyphony and never more than a bank of 127
possible instruments with the old General MIDI tracks.
Present consoles allocate a larger amount of memory for
sound generation, effectively allowing developers to
create more intricate and complex sound, using a wide
variety of tools.
To date, most developments in enhancing games
have been involved with improvements to game visuals,
with audio being tragically overlooked in favor of better
graphics. A game's interactive elements are enhanced
through the successful mating of graphics and audio. The
use of game sound and music promotes user
understanding of the game by creating a realistic feel by
complementing and highlighting elements of the virtual
world. The ultimate goal of game music and audio is to
provide the player with a rewarding game experience by
increasing interactivity, improving realism and
enhancing user emotions. The game sound director
achieves this by analyzing user response to game music,
and tailoring game audio accordingly.
The only limitations in the continuing advances of
game audio are present audio tools and the imagination
of sound designers. The challenge is to take game audio
to the next level of evolution, by conducting further
research and development in interactive audio.
