Abstract
In this paper, we introduce our project for
“hypothetical virtual butterfly”, of which flight
simulation of butterflies with hypothetical aesthetic
morphologies, and field work which we have done with
that simulation process. Furthermore we describe
making process of sculptures as an application of real
form from drawing sketches. The process to integrate
aesthetic hypothetical design materials with physical
simulation will be useful for not only butterflies but also
any other hypothetical things.

1. Introduction
Animated characters have appeared nowadays in
movies and animation due to the developments of
technologies on computer graphics. Physical aspects of
such animated characters, however, have largely been
needed to express reality. Therefore, it will be useful to
discuss methodologies to integrate physical simulation
and animations or computer graphics or further.
This paper introduces our project for “hypothetical
virtual butterfly”, of which morphologies are designed in
aesthetic perspectives, and within which physical
simulation and computer graphics are integrated. First,
we argue flight dynamics of butterflies in a real-world,
which explains how a butterfly obtains ascending force
from morphological and motional perspectives. Then, we
show that hypothetical virtual butterflies look as if they
were “realistic” because of the flight dynamics.
Furthermore, we introduce several possibilities of this
line of research; first, our approach can be applied to
variety of “artistic shows” which require highly aesthetic
aspects, and next, our approach can be applied to novel
sculpture which looks as if they were “living” in our
real-world.
Some researches exist about flight of insects [3] [4].
As for a flight dynamics of butterflies, Anzai is
considered with flight dynamics with flapping the Wings
[1].

2. Simulation of flight dynamics of
butterflies
'Pieris rapae', a small-white butterfly, changes
movements of its wings and body accordingly to the
purpose of its behaviors; (1) flying upward and
downward in order to find foods while avoiding possible
predator's attack; (2) gliding by keeping its wings open,
in order to optimize energies to fly; (3) flying straight by
moving wing flaps periodically, so that it can fly straight
to a certain goal-position as fast as possible.
In this paper, we adopt latter case behavior because
of the purpose of controlling butterflies’ movements. So
we simulated a butterfly which is flying straight to a
certain goal position, based on quasi-steady theory [2].
That is a theory of flight dynamics which assumes that
(1) flow velocity of air is constant; (2) left and right
wings of a butterfly do not effect each other; and (3)
wings are approximated as rigid plates and hence do not
deform. By simulating the interaction of wings and its
environmental aero flow, it is possible to get time-series
of butterflies’ postures and positions in a steady air.

2.1. Flight of Butterfly
Movements of a butterfly required to fly, mainly
consists of the following three components;
・ Flapping
・ Pitching
・ Feathering
2.1.1. Flapping
“Flapping” is defined as upward and downward
movements of wings attached to the chest part of a
butterfly (Fig. 1).

-80 degree)

2.1.2. Pitching
A bird, in general, controls its flight direction by
changing the angle of its wings relative to its body. On
the contrary, a butterfly controls its flight direction by
swinging its belly part. This swinging motion of the belly
part is defined as “Pitching”. And here, we define
pitching-angle as the angle of the chest-part relative to
the direction toward which a butterfly flies. (See Fig.2)

2.1.3. Feathering
Flapping induces aerial friction, and hence,
butterfly's hind wings are distorted passively. These
movements are defined as “Feathering” (see Fig.3).

Figure 3 Feathering angles (from left to right: 20,
0, -30 degree)
These angles change with time progress in simulation.
Time-series of flapping angle, pitching angle, and
feathering angle are described as; (based on [1])

Where theta represents time (0 − 2π ) , and y0 , y1 ,
and y2 are representing flapping angle, pitching angle,
and feathering angle, respectively.

3. Morphological design of butterflies
Fig. 4 shows the sketches for hypothetical virtual
butterflies, of which morphologies are designed from
aesthetic perspectives. Based on these sketches, we built
3D model of the hypothetical butterflies, with which we
simulate aerial flight dynamics (see Fig.5 for the 3D
models). As is shown in Fig.4, we hypothesized that the
virtual butterflies consists of “crystals''. The material and
the texture of the virtual butterflies are approximated
expression by using sphere-mapping methods. See Fig.6
for the representation of the texture and the material.
Note that this method is suitable to obtain variety of
different hypothetical virtual butterflies, changing its
texture is enough to generate different kind of butterfly,
as is shown in Fig.7.

Figure 5 3D Models from sketches

For simulation, we used 3D model described in
section 3, and adopting flight dynamics of butterflies
described in section 2. Each butterfly’s flying area is
rectangular parallelepiped and initially they are placed on
particular face, then moves towards opposite face (Fig.
8). Hereby it was found that crystal butterflies traveled to
goal point from initial point. In this study, although we
assumed that butterflies are flying straight to a certain
goal position, the crowds of butterflies could be
represented by dispersion of goal position. Figure 9
denotes a part of sequences of flight of the butterflies.

5. Field Work
We presented these hypothetical virtual butterflies at
"KANSAI SUPER SHOW: Taiyo no Fune (Ship of the
Sun)" in Tokyo Dome on January 2007 as a part of
dramatic scene [5]. Our animations were projected four
huge screens (600 inches each), and gives emotional
animations for audience. Figure 10 shows parts of
animation which projected to screen. Due to these
graphics was based on mathematical model, there was
reality despite of there are no such crystal butterflies in
real world.

6. Application of sculpture
We made a butterfly objet as an experiment of
application of three dimensional objects from sketches
on drawing paper. The process of making an objets is
that: at first, same as a flight simulation of butterflies we
described above, 3D model from sketches is needed.
Then, using that 3D model, the sculpture is made. This
sculpturing method can apply for not only butterflies but
also other sketches.
Figure 10 shows a sketch of a butterfly which is the
basis for sculpture. And the 3DCG model is created from
this sketch (Fig. 11). This sketch is not the crystal
butterfly but the hypothetical virtual butterfly with
hierarchical structure inside its wings. Then based on the
3DCG model, the sculpture is made. Figure 12 shows the
photographs of miniature sculpture what we got. The
faces of this sculpture are reproduced to correspond with
metallic faces in sketches. Finally we got this Butterfly
objet whose size is about 80x80x30cm (Fig. 13).

simulation of butterflies with hypothetical aesthetic
morphologies, and making process of sculptures as
application. These we described above attempts are
border area between aesthetics and technology. The
process, we showed, to integrate these aesthetic design
materials with physical simulation will be useful on any
other hypothetical living thing.
The future direction of this study will be:
