Abstract: The segmentation of images into
meaningful and homogenous regions is a crucial
step in many image analysis applications. In this
paper, we present a three-level thresholding
method for image segmentation. The method is
based on maximizing non-extensive entropy. After
segmentation, the output image will consist of
three homogenous regions, namely, dark, gray and
white. The threshold value for each region is
decided by maximizing an extended form of Tsallis
entropy. To improve the performance of the
proposed
algorithm,
an
efficient
and
computationally fast method for initializing the
search for maximum entropy is also presented.
Results obtained using the proposed algorithm are
compared with those obtained using Shannon
entropy.
I. Introduction
Image segmentation is referred to as the
procedure in which the input image is divided into
meaningful regions in such a way that the output
image will consist of a set of labeled regions
describing the input image. The segmented image
will contain a set of non-overlapping objects
representing pixels of similar gray values [1].
Image segmentation is a crucial step in a wide
range of image processing systems. Most of the
image segmentation algorithms produce binary
image, “foreground and background”. While these
results are acceptable in some image processing
applications such as document processing and
Optical Character Recognition systems, they are
not satisfactory in medical images where several
features, which are present in the image, need to be
detected and visualized. It is useful in visualization
of the different objects present in the image. For
example, segmentation of brain MR images into

gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid
play an important role in the extraction of
cerebrum which helps in detecting the changes due
to aging process[2].
Numerous segmentation algorithms have
been proposed and surveys of these techniques can
be found in [3]. Image segmentation techniques
can be categorized into three categories. The first
category uses clustering techniques using k-means
[4] or c-means [5]. In the clustering techniques
each pixels in the image is assigned into a class
according to its features which can be the gray
value or/and the coordinates of the
pixel.
Clustering techniques usually require priori
knowledge of the image in order to produce
acceptable results. Other classifications are carried
out by means of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is
employed to obtain the main chromaticities present
in the image. Then, each pixel is classified
according to the identified classes. When the
number of classes is a priori unknown, the ANN
that implements the SOM is used to determine the
main classes present in the image [6-7]. Due to the
implicit nature of information representation by
ANNs and the random nature of SOM, the results
are not always satisfactory and the convergence of
ANN is not always guaranteed.
The second category uses histogram
thresholding algorithms as in [8]. Histogram based
methods work well for images which can be clearly
separated into two or more regions but fail when
there is no significant contrast between the objects
and background. The third category uses adaptive
approaches to achieve pixels separation. Adaptive
approaches do not require any priori knowledge
about the image and can perform well when there
are objects overlapping in the image.

In this paper we propose a three-level gray
scale image segmentation method based on
maximizing an extension of Tsallis entropy
presented in [9]. We will also present efficient
computation techniques for fast convergence of the
entropy. This rest of the paper is organized as
follows: Section II is for representation of graylevel images, section 3 is an introduction to the
maximum entropy principles and the concept of
Non-extensivity, section 4 is the thresholding
techniques and section 5 is for the experimental
results.

If the image can be decomposed into three
statically independent subimages A,B, and C, the
entropy defined in 3 can be written as:
4
The Tsallis entropy which is a generalization of the
standard Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy given by Eq. 3 .
This entropic measure can be written in continuous
or discrete form as:

Or in the discrete form as:
Let D
i,j :i 0,…,M‐1;j 0,…,N‐1 where
M and N are two positive numbers. Let
R={0,1,…,l-1}, where l=256 for an 8-bit image.
Then the digitized gray-level image with l gray
levels is considered to be a two-variable function
I(x,y) with the domain D and range R. The
histogram of a digital image with gray levels in the
range of [0,l-1] is a discrete function h(rk)=nk,
where rk is kth level and nk is the number of pixels
that have k gray level. To normalize the histogram
is to divide each value by the total number of pixels
in the image (M×N). Hence, a normalized
histogram is given by

p (rk ) =

nk
, for k=0, 1,…, l-1
M ×N

Eq.(1) gives the definition of the probability of
occurrence of gray level nk. Note that the sum of
probability is

In this case, p denotes the probability distribution
of interest, and q is a real parameter. Taking the
limit as q → 1, the normal Boltzmann-Gibbs
entropy in Eq.3 is recovered. The parameter q is a
measure of the non-extensitivity of the system of
interest.

III. Maximum Entropy Principles
One of the interesting points about
transforming an image from the intensity domain
into the probability domain is how much
information it can keep. According to the
information theory [9], entropy can be defined as:
N −1

H ( A) = −∑ p ( xi ) log P ( xi )

(3)

i =0

xi, i=0,1,…,N-1, are the possible outputs from
source A with the probability P(xi). The larger
entropy H(A) is, the more information A contains.

q is a real number characterizes the degree of nonextensibility. Eq.8 recovers to Boltzmann-Gibbs
entropy as q → 1.
IV. The Thresholding Technique
Let p(xi)= p(x0), p(x1),…, p(xl-1) be the
probability distribution of an image with l-1 graylevels. From this distribution, we derive three
probability distributions, one representing the black

pixels (Class A), one representing the gray pixels
(Class B) and the third representing the white
pixels (class C), given by

P ( A) :

P( B) :

p ( xt 0 )

It is expected that t0 will fall in [0, µ ] and t1 in [ µ
+1, L-1], as initial values t0 and t1 are initialized as
follows:

p ( x L −1 )

Note that S q (t ) will depend on the threshold

The optimal values of t0 and t1 that maximizes E
are considered as the optimum threshold values.
To provide an initial estimate for t0 and t1
we use the following algorithm

We examine the performance of the
proposed algorithm on a variety of images.
Different types of images such as human faces,
medical images and natural scenes were included
in the experiments. Figs.1,2 and 3(a) show human
face, MR image and natural scene. Figs.1,2,and 3
(b) shows the results obtained on segmenting the
three images into three-levels using the proposed
algorithm with q=4. Figs. 1,2 and 3 (c) show the
results obtained by segmenting the three images
using Shannon entropy. It can be shown that the
proposed method gives more details especially in
the MR images. In the natural scene image, the
difference is not very clear due to the homogeneity
of the image. Using the initial values, the time
required was drastically reduced.
VI. Conclusions
In the paper, we have presented a threelevel thresholding method for image segmentation
based on probability partition of three classes of

the image using extended Tsallis entropy. Since
speed is a major concern for image segmentation, a
fast computation technique to improve the speed of
the segmentation algorithm was presented. The
time required for computing the three threshold
value is reduced to ¼ of the time required with out
using the initialing techniques.
