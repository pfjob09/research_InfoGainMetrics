2 WHAT IS EVENTSCOPE?

Telepresence, experiencing a place without physically being there,
offers an important means for the public experience of remote
locations such as distant continents or other planets. EventScope
presents one such telepresence visualization interface for bringing
scientific missions to the public. Currently, remote experience
lessons based on NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover missions are
being made available through the EventScope framework to
museums, classrooms, and the public at large.

EventScope is a freely downloadable suite of computer programs
that enables the experience of remote locations through 3D virtual
environments constructed directly from scientific data and
exploration of the remote sites [3]. For instance, EventScope is
currently focused on NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover missions
[5]. Using data from various NASA missions to Mars, including
Viking, Pathfinder, and Mars Global Surveyor, along with the
data returned from the Mars Exploration Rovers themselves, the
EventScope lab reconstructs that data into 3D models of Mars and
the rovers’ immediate vicinities. These models can be navigated
freely through the EventScope Viewer, or they can be
incorporated in remote experience lessons via the EventScope
Authoring Tool.

1 INTRODUCTION
Most people experience space exploration missions through the
data that is transmitted back to Earth from those missions.
Telepresence, remotely experiencing a place without physically
being there, presents an important framework for the design of a
public interface to space missions. NASA has made a plethora of
content (pictures, stereo images, scientific data, articles and other
material) available from the current Mars Exploration Rover
(MER) missions, and EventScope seeks to visualize that content
in the context of a telepresence experience.
EventScope brings mission data to the public in a tangible,
three-dimensional virtual environment, placing content within a
physical context and providing an interface for navigation and
interaction. In addition, EventScope provides a content Authoring
Tool so that educators, amateur scientists, school children, and
others can create custom content.

The Authoring Tool offers a number of features designed to
allow quick and easy creation of remote experience lessons,
which are similar in structure to hypertext documents. Using
“pages,” links, annotations, and other tools, authors construct
lessons. Data, such as photos or charts, can be directly
incorporated into the environments or juxtaposed through a splitscreen feature. In Figure 2, a photo of Endurance Crater taken by
one of the Mars Exploration Rovers is shown to the left of a 3D
model derived from the rover’s navigational cameras. In Figure
3, a scale model of the rover provides context while an arrow and
text are drawn directly on the surface with the Authoring Tool’s
annotation features.

In addition, for museums, the Wide-Angle Viewer, in
conjunction with an Elumens VisionStation [2], creates an
immersive Mars Exploration exhibit, as in the CyberSpace
Gallery installation at the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy
Museum, shown in Figure 5 [1]. A kiosk version of EventScope
offers museums an easy way to set up EventScope stations
without specialized knowledge or equipment. Through these
various methods of distribution, EventScope serves the public in
museums, classrooms, and homes.

3 REACHING THE PUBLIC
As a public interface, EventScope has been, and continues to be,
developed to be flexible in order to serve the public in a number
of ways. The downloadable Viewer and Authoring Tool bring
remote experiences into museums, classrooms, and homes via the
Internet, as seen in Figure 4.

There are a number of desired enhancements to EventScope. The
Viewer and Authoring Tool will be combined and refined for use
as a mission control interface. By tying the technology of mission
control to the public interface, EventScope will provide an
unprecedented level of guided public access to mission events and
data. Likewise, for the same reasons, EventScope is being
modified for use as an interface for scientific analysis of remote
sensing data. In fact, EventScope will be deployed as the science
interface for the upcoming NASA ASTEP Life in the Atacama
(LITA) mission [4]. In addition, technology is being implemented
to allow various levels of detail to exist seamlessly within a single
remote experience. A user will be able to zoom smoothly from a
view of an entire planet all the way down to a microscopic view.
All of these enhancements are aimed directly at providing a high
level of access, fidelity, and immersion for the remote experiences
offered through EventScope.
