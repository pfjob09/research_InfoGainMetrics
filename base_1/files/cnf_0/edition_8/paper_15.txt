Fig. 1. Representation. Very specific but easy to
understand mapping of data attributes.to
different visual objects.

Fig. 3. Occlusion. There is a lot of partial
occlusion, but sufficient redundancy in the
representation for comprehension.

Fig. 2. Representation. General but difficult to
understand mapping of data to 5 different
properties of a cube.

Fig. 4. Occlusion. Increasing partial occlusion
obscures the relationships.

Fig. 5. Reference Context. Scatter points are
difficult to locate..

Fig. 6. Reference Context. Drawing lines from
scatter point to plane locates the points.

Fig. 7. Reference Context. Scatter points are
difficult to locate in 3D space âˆ’ the depth is not
known

Fig. 8. Reference Context. Drawing lines from
scatter point to scatter point as a set of series
helps to visually locate the points and establish
the field.
