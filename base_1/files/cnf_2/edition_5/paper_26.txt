Abstract
Logarithmic spirals are ubiquitous in nature. This paper presents a novel mathematical definition of a 3D logarithmic spiral, which provides a proper description of objects found in nature. To motivate our work, we scanned
spiral-shaped objects and studied their geometric properties. We consider the extent to which the existing 3D definitions capture these properties. We identify a property that is shared by the objects we investigated and is not
satisfied by the existing 3D definitions. This leads us to present our definition in which both the radius of curvature and the radius of torsion change linearly along the curve. We prove that our spiral satisfies several desirable
properties, including invariance to similarity transformations, smoothness, symmetry, extensibility, and roundness.
Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our curves in the modeling of several animal structures.

1. Introduction
Nature is rich in spirals [Coo03, Coo79]. They exist in animal and human anatomy – in horns, seashells, muscles, and
bones, as well as in botany – in the formation of leaves, flowers (sunflower heads), fruit (pineapples, pine cones), and tree
trunks. Hurricanes are shaped as spirals. Some bays, such
as the Half-Moon Bay in California, are spirals. Cook also
points to the relation between the incidence of spirals in nature and their appearance in art and architecture.
It is thus not surprising that spirals have attracted the
attention of mathematicians as well as biologists, zoologists, paleontologists, artists, and psychologists. In computer
graphics, despite the aspiration to produce natural-looking
models, relatively few attempts have been made to model

spirals. This paper focuses on logarithmic spirals – the ones
believed to characterize many of the natural phenomena described above [Mos38, d’A42, Hun70].
The 2D logarithmic spiral is defined in four different manners [d’A42,Hun70]. A few extensions of the 2D logarithmic
spiral to 3D were introduced for modeling seashells [Cor89,
Pic89, FMP92]. They were demonstrated to produce some
beautiful seashells. However, we provide evidence that some
of these extensions are too restrictive to describe the richness
of spirals in nature, and prove that the other extensions do
not hold any 3D definition.
These observations led us to present a different mathematical extension. It requires that both the radius of the curvature
and the radius of the torsion change linearly along the curve.

To support this definition we show, based on a study of natural objects, that this property indeed characterizes spiralslike objects in nature. In addition, we prove that our spiral
satisfies other desirable properties including invariance to
similarity transformations, smoothness, symmetry, extensibility (i.e. refinability), and roundness (i.e., if the boundary
conditions lie on a circle, the curve is a circle).
We demonstrate the utility of our logarithmic spiral for
modeling spiral-shaped animal structures, such as seashells,
horns, and tails, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The contribution of this paper is hence threefold. First, we
analyze, both theoretically and empirically, some properties
of the 3D logarithmic spirals in the literature. We also study
characteristics of natural spiral-shaped objects. We show that
the two do not conform (Section 3). Second, motivated by
the above observation, the paper presents a new extension to
3D of the logarithmic spiral and proves its properties (Section 4). Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our spirals
in modeling a variety of natural structures in wildlife (Section 5). We show that the obtained models suit the corresponding natural objects. Altogether, our spirals are evaluated theoretically, empirically, and visually.
2. Background
A variety of spirals have been investigated in computer
graphics, including the 3D Helispirals [GS99], Euler spirals [Lev08, HT10], and Logarithmic spirals. This paper focuses on the latter.
2D logarithmic spirals: The planar logarithmic spiral was
discovered several times by different mathematicians. The
first to discover the spiral was Descartes, who in 1638 named
it the equiangular spiral after one of its characteristics. Torricelli named it the geometrical spiral after another property
of the curve – its radius increases exponentially as a function
of the angle. Later, Halley named it the proportional spiral
after its third characteristic. About fifty years later, in 1711,
Jacob Bernoulli was the first to describe the curve without
using a polar equation. Bernoulli gave the curve its fourth
name – the logarithmic spiral. He was so fascinated by its
mathematical beauty that he also named it spira mirabilis

(the marvelous spiral) and asked that this curve be engraved
on his tombstone. (However, by error, an Archimedean spiral
was placed there instead.)
Being discovered by four different mathematicians, each
focusing on a different characteristic, the curve can be defined in four different, yet equivalent, ways (see Figure 2):
2D Definition 1 – Equiangular spiral: A spiral whose radius vector cuts the curve at a constant angle (Figure 2(a)).
2D Definition 2 – Geometrical spiral: A spiral whose radius increases in geometrical progression as its polar angle increases in arithmetical progression: θ = t, r = r0 ξt
(Figure 2(b)).
2D Definition 3 – Proportional spiral: A spiral in which
the lengths of the segments of the curve cut by a fixed
radial ray are in continued proportion (Figure 2(c)). In
other words, the segments are scaled versions of each
other, where the scaling ratios between successive pairs
are equal.
2D Definition 4 – Logarithmic spiral: A spiral having a
linear radius of curvature (i.e., a linear inverse of the cur1
vature): κ(s) = r0 +∆
(Figure 2(d)).
rs
3D logarithmic spirals: Extensions of 2D logarithmic spirals to 3D were discussed mostly in the context of modeling
seashells. Three different extensions were proposed, all requiring that the projection of the curve onto the xy plane will
give a 2D logarithmic spiral.
The first extension requires that θ = t, r = r0 ξt , z = z0 ξt ,
where r0 , z0 and ξ are constants [Wun67, Cor89, Pic89].
These spirals are known to be paths of one-parameter groups
of similarity transformations [Wun67, HOP∗ 05]. In Cartesian coordinates, the spiral is defined as:
S1 (t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)] = r0 ξt cos(t), r0 ξt sin(t), z0 ξt . (1)
The second extension is proposed by Pickover [Pic89].
For constants r0 , α, ξ, it is defined as:
S2 (t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)] = [r0 ξt cos(t), r0 ξt sin(t), αt]. (2)
The third extension is presented in [FMP92]. For constants r0 , z0 , ξr and ξz , the curve is defined as:
S3 (t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)] = [r0 ξtr cos(t), r0 ξtr sin(t), z0 ξtz ]. (3)

curvature were measured (b). It can be seen that these quantities are not related by scale. The graphs in (c-d) illustrate that the
radii of the curvature & torsion, each grows approximately linearly. See additional results in the supplementary material.

Though this extension generalizes the first extension, in
practice, most of the results shown in [FMP92] use a constrained set of parameters (ξr = ξz = ξ), resulting in curves
that coincide with those of the first extension.
In the next section we discuss the reasons for the insufficiency of these extensions for modeling some natural logarithmic spiral-shaped objects. In light of this discussion we
present in Section 4 a novel definition.
3. Do previous extensions suffice?
We start by giving four definitions of 3D logarithmic spirals,
each extends one of the 2D definitions. We then describe
our empirical study in which we examine some properties
of natural spiral-shaped objects. We consider how well the
existing 3D extensions comply with the 3D definitions and
whether they suit the properties captured in the study. Finally, we identify a property that is shared by the objects we
investigated and is not satisfied by the known extensions.

which any plane adjacent to the spiral’s major axis cuts it
at a constant tangent (Figure 3(a)).
3D Definition 2 – Geometrical spiral: A spiral for which
the length of the radius R increases in geometrical progression as its polar angle θ increases in arithmetical progression, where R = x2 + y2 + z2 and θ = arctan(y/x)
(Figure 3(b)).
3D Definition 3 – Proportional spiral: A spiral for which
the lengths of the segments of the curve, cut by a plane
through the spiral’s major axis, are in continued proportion (Figure 3(c)).
3D Definition 4 – Logarithmic spiral: A spiral having a
linear radius of curvature and a linear radius of torsion
(Figure 3(d)).
In our study, we scanned eleven seashells, horns, and fruit.
Figure 4(a) shows a couple of the scanned objects. We then
computed the change in the radius of the curvature ( κ1 ) and
that of the radius of the torsion ( 1τ ) for curves on the objects’ surfaces. These curves are the smoothed valleys and
ridges of the surface. The curvature and the torsion were

240

computed using the independent coordinates method proposed by [LGLC05], which is shown to be robust to noise.
The beauty of the first 3D extension (S1 , Equation (1)) is
that it satisfies all four 3D definitions. However, we prove in
Appendix A (Proposition A.1) that in this spiral the radius of
curvature and the radius of torsion are equal up to a constant
(i.e. it is a curve of constant slope). But, our study shows that
this is not the case in nature – the radii are not related by any
constant; see Figure 4(b). Like any other general 3D curve,
the curvature and the torsion are independent. Hence, spirals that relate them are too restrictive and cannot accurately
describe the variety of natural spiral objects.
We now turn to examine S2 and S3 (Equations (2)–(3)).
We prove in Appendix A (Propositions A.2–5) that these spirals do not satisfy any of the above 3D definitions. Hence,
while they produce pretty results, theoretically they are not
proper extensions. Moreover, we later demonstrate in Figure 6 that these spirals are indeed less accurate for describing
natural objects than our spiral.
Finally, our study also shows that linear radii of the curvature and torsion approximately characterize the curves, in
accordance with 3D Definition 4; see Figures 4(c-d). This
calls for a different mathematical extension of a logarithmic
spiral – one that satisfies this definition. This is the rationale
behind our definition, which is discussed next.

The results of the studies presented in Section 3 led us to define a different 3D logarithmic spiral, which generalizes the
extension of [Wun67,Cor89,Pic89], yet is able to represent a
wider variety of natural objects. This section defines the 3D
logarithmic spiral as the curve that satisfies the fourth 3D
definition, as illustrated in Figure 5. Obviously, this curve
conforms with the definition of the 2D logarithmic spiral.
We also prove the curve’s existence and uniqueness up to a
rigid transformation and some additional properties. Finally,
we show that our spiral is more accurate than other logarithmic spirals for approximating real data.

4.1. Definition & existence
We seek a spiral that has both a linear radius of curvature and
a linear radius of torsion in the arc-length parametrization s:

, τ(s) =
,
(r0 + ∆r s)
(σ0 + ∆σ s)

We define the curve that satisfies Equation (4) by a set of
differential equations. Assume that we are given the following initial conditions: a point x0 on the curve, a tangent T0
and a normal N0 at x0 .
Definition 4.1 The 3D logarithmic spiral is the curve that
satisfies the initial conditions for s = 0 and the following:

curve is unique up to a rigid transformation.
Proof By the definition of the curvature of curves in R3 ,
2
κ(s) = ddsC2 (s) ≥ 0. According to the fundamental theorem of local theory of curves, for every differential function
with κ(s) > 0 and τ(s), there exists a regular parameterized
curve, where κ(s) is the curvature, τ(s) is the torsion, and s is
the arc-length parametrization [dC76]. Moreover, any other
curve satisfying the same conditions differs by a rigid motion. Note that in our definition κ(s) may be negative, and
when this happens we consider |κ(s)|.
4.2. Properties of the spiral
This section proves that our spiral holds some attractive
properties. In [MS92] it is claimed that a curve’s fairness is
closely related to how little and how smoothly its curvature
and its torsion change. Other important properties mentioned
in the literature are invariance to similarity transformations,
smoothness, symmetry, extensibility, roundness, and being
locally constructed [Ull76, Knu79, HT10].
Before, we discussed the smooth change of the curve’s curvature and torsion. This section proves that our 3D logarithmic curve also holds the following properties.

1. Invariance to similarity transformations – translation, rotation, and scale. For the latter, we show that scaling of
the end-points scales the curve by the same scaling factor.
2. Smoothness: The tangent is defined at every point, i.e.,
∂C
is finite. (In fact, our curve is C∞ -smooth.)
∂s
3. Symmetry: The curve leaving the point x0 with tangent
T0 and reaching the point x f with tangent T f , coincides
with the curve leaving the point x f with tangent −T f and
reaching the point x0 with tangent −T0 .
4. Extensibility: For every point xm ∈ C between the endpoints x0 and x f , the curves C1 (between x0 and xm ) and
C2 (between xm and x f ) coincide with C.
5. Roundness: If C interpolates two point-tangent pairs lying on a circle, then C is a circle.
Proposition 4.2 A 3D logarithmic spiral is invariant to similarity transformations.
Proof Invariance to rotation and translation results from
Proposition 4.1. We next prove scale invariance. We are
given a logarithmic spiral C of length L, which interpolates x0 = C(0) and x f = C(L), and whose parameters are
r0 , σ0 , ∆r , ∆σ . We should show that the spiral Cλ , which
interpolates λx0 and λx f for λ > 0, is equal to λC, i.e.,
∀s, 0 ≤ s ≤ L Cλ (s) = λC(s). Thus, we need to find the constants r0 , σ0 , ∆r , ∆σ , L that define the logarithmic spiral Cλ ,
for which Cλ (0) = λx0 and Cλ (λL) = λx f , with tangents T0
and T f respectively. Then, we should show that every point
on this curve coincides with λC.
It easy to show that the 3D logarithmic spiral having parameters r0 = λr0 , σ0 = λσ0 , ∆r = ∆r , ∆σ = ∆σ , L = λL is the
sought-after curve.
This is done by substituting these parameters in Definition 4.1(1–3) and defining a new parameter v = s/λ (⇒ dv =
1 dT
dN
1 dN
ds/λ). We get that ddsT = ddvT dv
ds = λ dv . Similarly, ds = λ dv
and ddsB = λ1 ddvB . Hence, this curve satisfies Definition 4.1
with parameter v.
We can now calculate the 3D logarithmic spiral as follows:

Proof According to Proposition 4.1, there exists a solution
= T (s) is defor the Frenet-Serret equations. Therefore, ∂C
∂s
fined for every 0≤s≤L.
Proposition 4.4 A 3D logarithmic spiral is symmetric.
Proposition 4.5 A 3D logarithmic spiral is extensible.
The proofs of propositions 4.4–4.5 are given in appendix B.
Proposition 4.6 A 3D logarithmic spiral is round.
Proof For given two point-tangent pairs lying on a circle,
the circle defined by r0 = 0, σ0 → ∞, ∆r = 0, ∆σ = 0 is a
solution of the Frenet-Serret Equations.
4.3. Results
To verify the suitability of our spiral for describing natural objects, we compared it, as well as the other proposed
spirals (S1 , S2 , S3 ), to the spirals obtained from our scanned
objects (Figure 4). This is done as follows. Given a scanned
object, its main axis is found [HOP∗ 05] (this step is needed
only for S2 and S3 ). Then, depending on the spiral definition, the values of the free parameter (arc-length s for our
spiral and angle t for the other spirals) at sampled points, are
found. Next, the alignment between the curves is calculated
using [MHTG05]. Finally, the mean-square error (MSE)
between the spiral of the scanned object and that of the
analytically-computed spiral is computed using a GradientDescent algorithm that minimizes this error.
Figure 6 displays some of the results for the normalized objects. It can be seen that our spiral better fits the data than
the other spirals and that our error is smaller. We perform
comparisons to two out of three previous logarithmic spirals
since S3 includes S1 as a special case. Thus, in essence, we
compared our results to all previous spirals.

5. Application: Modeling spiral-like structures in fauna
This section presents our results for modeling seashells,
horns, and other animal structures – all believed to comply
with the logarithmic structure.
Modeling seashells: The beauty of seashells has attracted
the attention of many researchers. Moseley [Mos38] was

242

G. Harary & A. Tal / The Natural 3D Spiral

the first to characterize seashells with logarithmic spirals. His characteristic was supported experimentally by
d’Arcy [d’A42]. Raup [Rau61, Rau62] proposed to model
the morphology of a shell. In computer graphics, enhanced
appearance of shell models was suggested by [Kaw82,
Opp86, PS86]. Increased attention to details was presented
in [Ill87, Cor89]. Fowler et al. [FMP92] extended the morphological model of [Cor89] and added a pigmentation pattern to the model, which together resulted in pretty seashells.
Our modeling algorithm follows [FMP92]. Therefore, we
present it only briefly, for the sake of completeness of the
description. The main difference between the algorithms is
the use of our spiral to model the seashells instead of S3 . We
also address the issue of shell opening, which has not been
handled previously.
The algorithm, illustrated in Figure 7, has four steps: First,
a 3D logarithmic spiral is constructed. Then, the shell’s surface is constructed. Third, the shell’s opening is formed, and
finally the shell’s pattern is generated.

1. 3D LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL CONSTRUCTION : A 3D logarithmic spiral Clog is constructed. This is done by simply
choosing the curve’s parameters r0 , σ0 , ∆r , ∆σ and L, and approximating Clog numerically using the Runge-Kutta 5 (4)
method [DP80]. This is an adaptive one-step solver, in which
the computation of the point x(tn+1 ) needs only the solution
at the immediately preceding time point x(tn ). It is designed
to produce an estimate of the local truncation error of a single Runge-Kutta step, and as result, allows to control the
error with an adaptive step-size. That is done by having two
Runge-Kutta methods, one with order 5 and one with order
4. This is to say, the total accumulated error has order h5
(respectively, h4 ), where h is a basic, non-adaptive step-size
of t. In practice, we used 250 sample points for the curves
in our models. We examined the MSE between these curves
and denser curves with 10000 sample points. The average
MSE is 1.6E-4.

3. F ORMING THE SHELL OPENING : The sweeping of a
uniformly growing generating curve along the logarithmic
spiral produces a strictly self-similar surface that can be
mapped onto itself by scale and rotation around the shell
axis [d’A42]. In real shells, the lips at the shell opening often
display a departure from self-similarity.
We model the opening using a closed curve Copen that describes the shape of the opening. Instead of sweeping the
generating curve along the entire logarithmic spiral as done
in [FMP92], we sweep it only when the parameter s is
in the range [s0 , L − ∆L]. For the rest of the spiral, when
s ∈ [L − ∆L, L], we use a linear interpolation between the
generating curve and Copen .

2. S HELL SURFACE CONSTRUCTION : The surface is built as
a general sweep surface, where Clog is the route. In practice,
Clog is sampled and a closed curve – the generating curve
– traverses only the sampled points. The generating curve is
scaled along the route linearly w.r.t. the arc-length of the spiral. The resulting surface is represented by a mesh, where a

patterns in shells show an enormous amount of diversity. We
simulate them using a class of reaction-diffusion models developed by [MK87a, MK87b] and used in [FMP92]. For a
given biological model, described by reaction-diffusion differential equations, the solution results in an image, which is
mapped to the mesh.
R ESULTS : Figures 8–11 illustrate some results obtained by
our algorithm. These examples were chosen since they were
modeled by [FMP92], and thus they allow us to provide a

fair comparison to the results presented in their paper as well
as to the original images given there. Since the seashells
of [FMP92] were produced by a constrained spiral model
(S1 is a special case of S3 ), these comparisons can be viewed
also as comparisons to S1 .
Our models are more similar to the natural seashells in several manners. First, as our spiral is less restrictive, we are
able to produce seashells whose general structure better resembles the natural shells than its competitors (Figures 8–9).
Second, the upper and the lower tips of our shells look more
natural (Figures 9–10). Finally, since we added opening formation, we are able to control it and produce narrower or
wider openings, as required (Figures 10–11). The last two
steps of the algorithm – opening formation and pigmentation – were applied only to the models in Figures 10–11.
Modeling horns: Animal horns are structured as logarithmic spirals [d’A42]. Yet, there exist only a few studies that
model horns. In [Kaw82, Ste¸09] a horn is created by assembling given modules along a path. In [Kaw82] every branch
of the horn is a 2D spiral, whereas in [Ste¸09] the path is S3 .
We propose to model the geometry of horns in two steps.
First, the 3D logarithmic spiral is constructed. Then, a
surface that supports 3D texture (i.e. fluctuations) is constructed, in compliance with the fact that horns have visible
3D textures. We propose to create this structure by adding
small fluctuations to the size of the generating curve when
traversed along the route Clog . The fluctuations can be rec 2010 The Author(s)

Figures 1(c),12,14, where only the “outer” part of the horns
has fluctuations.
The provided results demonstrate not only the 3D fluctuation, but also the ability of our algorithm to support bending
(curvature), as demonstrated in Figure 12, and twisting (torsion), shown in Figures 1(c) and 14. Figure 14 also shows
the modeling of the Kudu’s horn in [Ste¸09]. (The paper does
not provide the image this model is inspired by.)
Modeling other animal structures: A variety of other organs of animals are shaped as logarithmic spirals. Figure 15

of the inner ear. It is a spiralled, hollow, conical chamber of
bone. Figures 1(a) and 16 show our models of spiral-shaped
tails – that of a lizard and that of a sea horse. In all these
examples, our models resemble the spirals in the images. In
Figure 1(a), the mesh was textured using standard texture
mapping.

Logarithmic spirals characterize many natural structures.
This paper addressed the challenge of extending the wellknown 2D logarithmic spiral to 3D. Our mathematical definition was motivated by studying previous extensions and
showing that they may be too restrictive for representing the
variety of spiral-shaped objects.
We provide three types of analysis of our spirals as well as of
previously proposed spirals: theoretical, empirical, and visual. Theoretically, we prove some desirable properties of
the spiral. Empirically, we scanned objects and tested the fit
between the mathematical definitions and actual spirals in
nature. Visually, we produced models that demonstrate the
use of the various spirals for modeling structures that appear
in the wildlife. Our spirals outperform the other spirals in all
these aspects.

Running time and user interaction: The algorithm was
implemented in Matlab and ran on a 2Ghz Intel Core 2 Dueprocessor machine with 2Gb of memory. The running time
is about 5 seconds for a 100,000-vertex model.
We built a GUI that allows the user to control the parameters. The user’s interaction is similar to that of the previous
approaches – requiring to choose a similar number of parameters. Table 1 lists the parameters used for generating
the models presented in this paper.

Hereafter we prove that S2 , S3 (Equations (2)–(3)) do not satisfy any of the four 3D Definitions. We first prove that 3D
Definition 1 is violated in the general case. Then we prove,
by providing counter examples, that 3D Definitions 2-4 are
violated. In these examples, the parameters used are r0 =
1, α = 3, ξ = 1.1 for S2 and r0 = 1, z0 = 3, ξr = 1.1, ξz = 1.5
for S3 .
Proposition A.2 S2 and S3 are not equitangential spirals.
Proof: According to 3D Definition 1, the tangents to the
curve at points having polar angles tn = t0 + 2πn (n ∈ N)
should be equal, thus they should not depend on n.
But, in S2 the tangent is:
T2 (tn ) = [r0 ξtn (ln(ξ)cos(t0 ) − sin(t0 )),
r0 ξtn (ln(ξ)sin(t0 ) + cos(t0 )), α]/ T2 ,
where T2 =
tangent is:

r02 ξ2tn (1 + ln2 (ξ)) + α2 , whereas in S3 the

T3 (tn ) = [r0 ξtrn (ln(ξr )cos(t0 ) − sin(t0 )),
r0 ξtrn (ln(ξr )sin(t0 ) + cos(t0 )), z0 ln(ξz )ξtzn ]/ T3 ,
n
2 2tn 2
2
where T3 = r02 ξ2t
r (1 + ln (ξr )) + z0 ξz ln (ξz ).
Hence, in both cases the tangents depend on n.

Proposition A.3 S2 and S3 are not geometrical spirals.
Proof: According to 3D Definition 2, the length of the radius should depend exponentially on the polar angle, thus
the graph of log(R) w.r.t the polar angle should be linear.
Figure 17 demonstrates that for the above counter-examples,
the graphs of these spirals are not linear.

Appendix A: S1 ,S2 , S3 and the 3D definitions
This section discusses the properties of the existing 3D spiral
extensions S1 , S2 , S3 (Equations (1)–(3)).

Proposition A.1 S1 is a curve of constant slope.
Proof: The curvature and the torsion of the spiral S1 are calculated as [dC76]:
κ(t) =

τ(t) =

1 + ln2 (ξ)

r
|S1 (t)×S1 (t)|

|S1 (t)×S1 (t)|2

Thus, the spiral has a constant slope:
τ(t)

Proposition A.4 S2 and S3 are not proportional spirals.
Proof: According to 3D Definition 3, the ratio between the
length of the radii at the polar angles t1 = t0 and t2 =
t0 + 2πn for t0 ∈ [0, 2π] and n ∈ N should be constant, hence
R(t0 )
= const, ∀t0 ∈ [0, 2π].
R(t0 +2πn)
Figure 18 shows a counter example for t0 =
0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, π/2 and n = 1. It shows that in both
cases the 3D definition does not hold.
Proposition A.5 S2 and S3 are not logarithmic spirals.

Proof: Given a 3D logarithmic spiral C that interpolates the
point-tangent pairs (x0 , T0 ) and (x f , T f ), we will show that
for every (xm , Tm ) on C, the curves C1 between x0 and xm
and C2 between xm and x f coincide with C.
Assume that C has parameters r0 , σ0 , ∆r , ∆σ , L. Let L1 be the
length of the sub-curve of C from x0 to xm . By the tangent
definition and by Equation (5):

do not satisfy 3D Definition 4.
Appendix B: Proofs of properties of our spiral
Proposition 4.4 A 3D logarithmic spiral is symmetric.
Proof: Given a 3D logarithmic spiral C that interpolates
the point-tangent pairs (x0 , T0 ) and (x f , T f ), we need to
show that the 3D logarithmic spiral Csym that interpolates
(x f , −T f ) and (x0 , −T0 ) coincides with C.
Suppose that the parameters of C are r0 , σ0 , ∆r , ∆σ , L. We
show below that the 3D logarithmic spiral Csym whose parameters are r0 = r0 + ∆r L, σ0 = σ0 + ∆σ L, ∆r = −∆r ,
∆σ = −∆σ , L = L, coincides with C and that their tangents
are opposite. According to Definition 4.1 we get:

By the uniqueness of the curve (Proposition 4.1), C1 with
the parameters r0 = r0 , σ0 = σ0 , ∆r = ∆r , ∆σ = ∆σ , L = L1 ,
coincides with C for 0≤s≤L1 .
Next, we show that C2 with the parameters r0 = r0 +
∆r L1 , σ0 = σ0 + ∆σ L1 , ∆r = ∆r , ∆σ = ∆σ , L = L − L1 , coincides with C for L1 ≤s≤L. Let us denote the tangent of the
curve C at C(s) by TC (s) and the tangent of the curve C2
at C2 (s) by TC2 (s). We need to show that C2 that starts at
(xm , Tm ) reaches C(s) with tangent TC (s), ∀s, L1 ≤s≤L.
Similarly to the proof of Proposition 4.4, it can be shown
that ∀s, L1 ≤ s ≤ L, the tangent at C2 (s − L1 ) is TC (s):
TC2 (s − L1 ) =
