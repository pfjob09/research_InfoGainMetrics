A New Ward BRDF Model with Bounded Albedo
David Geisler-Moroder and Arne Dür†
University of Innsbruck, Austria

Abstract
Due to its realistic appearance, computational convenience, and efficient Monte Carlo sampling, Ward’s
anisotropic BRDF is widely used in computer graphics for modeling specular reflection. Incorporating the criticism that the Ward and the Ward-Dür model do not meet energy balance at grazing angles, we propose a modified
BRDF that is energy conserving and preserves Helmholtz reciprocity. The new BRDF is computationally cheap
to evaluate, admits efficient importance sampling, and thus sustains the main benefits of the Ward model. We
show that the proposed BRDF is better suited for fitting measured reflectance data of a linoleum floor used in a
real-world building than the Ward and the Ward-Dür model.

Over the last five decades numerous BRDF models were
introduced. Beckmann [BS63] and Torrance and Sparrow
[TS67] presented physically based microfacet BRDF models
that use the Gaussian distribution to define the microfacets’
surface normals. The model by Torrance and Sparrow was
used in computer graphics by Cook and Torrance [CT81]
and later improved by He et al. [HTSG91]. However, these
models are neither suitable for Monte Carlo integration due
to missing efficient importance sampling formulae, nor do
they provide anisotropic reflection. The first empirical and
probably most famous model that simulates specular reflections was introduced by Phong [Pho75] and later improved by Blinn [Bli77]. Other physically plausible BRDFs
that model anisotropic reflection and are suitable for Monte
Carlo integration were proposed by Schlick [Sch94], Lafortune et al. [LFTG97], Ashikmin and Shirley [AS00], and
Kurt et al. [KSKK10].

1. Introduction
A bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)
[NRH∗ 77] f (θl , φl ; θv , φv ) describes the reflectance properties of a surface by specifying the amount of radiance incident from direction (θl , φl ) that is reflected into direction
(θv , φv ), i.e.,
Lv (θv , φv ) =

Z 2πZ π/2
0

0

Ll (θl , φl ) f (θl , φl ; θv , φv ) cos θl sin θl dθl dφl .
(1)

The main characteristics of a physically plausible BRDF
are Helmholtz reciprocity and energy conservation [Lew94].
Helmholtz reciprocity stands for the symmetry between incident and reflected directions,
f (θl , φl ; θv , φv ) = f (θv , φv ; θl , φl ),

(2)

that allows global illumination calculations by backward ray
tracing algorithms [Whi80]. Energy conservation – or energy balance – means that the albedo, i.e., the total reflected
power for a given direction of incident radiation,
a(θl , φl ) =

As a simplification of the Cook-Torrance model, Ward
[War92] presented an anisotropic BRDF that was later improved by Dür [Dür06]. The main benefits of this model
are that it is computationally cheap to evaluate, it admits
efficient importance sampling for Monte Carlo integration,
and it is simple and intuitive to use with only three parameters, one for specularity and two for roughness. Neumann et
al. [NNSK99] proposed modifications for the Phong, Blinn,

weighting factors are mostly neglected in the Monte Carlo
integration (for details on the implementation in RADIANCE [War94, WS98] see [GMD10]). However, at grazing
angles the difference between the BRDF fWD and the sampling PDF dα,β is significant and can be clearly observed in
Figure 2. Figure 2(a) shows the set-up of a test scene where
a gray isotropic surface with 80% specular reflection (ρd =
0.12, ρs = 0.48) and roughness α = 0.1 is viewed at a grazing angle of 1◦ . Below, the luminance distributions that result if the direct illumination is computed by evaluating the
Ward-Dür BRDF (Figure 2(b)) or by using Ward’s sampling

i.e. is greater than 1. Using max(cos θl , cos θv ) instead of cos θl cos θv in Equation (4), Neumann et al. propose a modification that meets energy balance but still has
the shortcoming that specular highlights are too dark, especially for low-lying light sources. We refer to this modification as Ward-Neumann BRDF.
Because the Ward-Dür
BRDF can be written as
√
fWD (l, v) = fW (l, v)/ cos θl cos θv the lower bound argument that proves the divergence of the albedo of the Ward
BRDF at grazing angles in Equation (41) in [NNSK98] also
holds for the Ward-Dür BRDF. In Figure 6 the albedos of
the Ward-Neumann BRDF, the Ward BRDF, the Ward-Dür
BRDF, our new BRDF, and the PDF of Ward’s sampling
method are compared.

proves that the new BRDF is different from both the Beckmann distribution [BS63] and the model by Kurt, SzirmayKalos, and Kˇrivánek [KSKK10]. Compared to the Ward-Dür
BRDF, the factor l, n v, n in the denominator of Equation (5) is replaced by l, h v, h h, n 4 = l, h 2 h, n 4 .
The polar plots in Figures 3 and 4 compare the isotropic
BRDF of our proposed model to the Ward and the Ward-Dür
model for roughness values α = β = 0.1 or α = β = 0.2 in
the plane of incidence. From Figures 3 and 4 one can see that
the new BRDF mainly coincides with the Ward-Dür BRDF
but does not diverge to infinity at grazing angles. The polar
plots in Figure 5 compare the BRDFs for constant polar angles. The coincidence of the Ward-Dür BRDF and the new
BRDF in Figure 5 also indicates that for realistic roughness
values α and β up to 0.25 the two BRDFs almost match. In
particular

Motivated by the discrepancy between the evaluation of the

account for the criticism by Neumann et al. [NNSK99], we
propose the following modification of the Ward-Dür BRDF
that preserves Helmholtz reciprocity:

In the appendix we show that the albedo is close to 1 for
small roughness values and non-flat angles, and we prove
that the albedo converges to 1 for θl → π/2.

In Figure 6(a) the albedo functions of the Ward-Neumann
BRDF, the Ward BRDF, the Ward-Dür BRDF, the new
BRDF, and the PDF of Ward’s sampling method are compared in the isotropic case for roughness values α = β = 0.1
and specular reflectance ρs = 1. Note that the albedo of the
sampling method is calculated as a(v) because in backward
ray tracing v is the incident direction and l is the sampled
direction. Because the probability that a direction generated
by Ward’s sampling method has polar angle θl < π/2 converges to 1/2 for θv → π/2, the albedo of the PDF converges
to 0.5 for θv → π/2. Figure 6(b) shows the behaviour of the
albedo functions for the Ward BRDF, the Ward-Dür BRDF,
and the new BRDF at grazing angles. In Figure 7 the albedo
functions of our proposed BRDF in the isotropic cases
α = β = 0.01, α = β = 0.05, α = β = 0.1, and α = β = 0.2
are presented.

Grazing Angle Test Scene
We re-rendered the test scene of Section 2 (see Figure 2(a)
for the set-up) using Equation (18) for calculating the direct specular component from the light source (Figure 8(a))
or using Equation (16) for computing the indirect specular
component from the luminaire now included in the indirect
calculation (Figure 8(b)). By using luminance contour lines
laid over the images it is clearly visualized that the resulting
distributions are the same for the new BRDF and the sampling using the new weighting factors. Including our proposed BRDF and weighting factors in the current version of
RADIANCE [Rad10] does not change the rendering times
observably.

For the curve fitting we use a similar approach as Ngan et
al. [NDM05], i.e. we define the objective function for fitting
as
g(θl , φl ; θv , φv ) =
data(θl , φl ; θv , φv ) −

The BRDF of an isotropic red linoleum floor was measured
with a gonioreflectometer for 222 pairs of incident/outgoing

[CIE04] is 17.5% and was measured by Bartenbach LichtLabor using an integrating sphere.

ularity ρs increases and thus corrects the length of the lobe
that is shortened by the greater α. The decrease of the fitting
error by a factor of 3 demonstrates that, for the linoleum,
the new BRDF is better suited to approximate the measured
data. Figure 9 shows the measured BRDF data together with
the fits obtained from the new BRDF for incidence angles
from 25◦ to 75◦ every 10◦ .
Figure 10 shows a test scene for comparing the Ward-Dür

an isotropic red linoleum sphere that is modeled with the
particular parameters from Table 1. Because the differences
between the highlights in Figures 10(a) and 10(b) are hardly
visible, a close-up of the right highlight was rendered. Figure 11 shows the results obtained from using the Ward-Dür

to the Ward BRDF and by a factor of 3 compared to the
Ward-Dür BRDF. For the proposed model the estimated parameters yield more expanded specular highlights and up to
five times brighter reflections in off-center regions.

Appendix
In Section 3 we state that, in the plane of incidence, the
maximum of the BRDF fnew (θl , φl ; θv , φv ) occurs below
the mirror direction, whereas the peak of the BRDF times
the cosine of the polar angle of the reflected direction
fnew (θl , φl ; θv , φv ) · cos θv is located in the mirror direction.

BRDF seems to be desirable.

Thus fnew (θl , φl ; θv , φl + π) is still increasing in the mirror
direction θv = θl and must have its maximum below. Using
the product rule and applying Equation (12) we find that
∂ ( fnew (θl , φl ; θv , φl + π) · cos θv )

5. Conclusion
We presented a new BRDF model based on the Ward-Dür
BRDF [Dür06]. The proposed model is physically plausible, i.e., it satisfies Helmholtz reciprocity and meets energy
balance. For realistic roughness values up to 0.25 and for
non-flat angles the new BRDF is very close to the Ward-Dür
BRDF. Ward’s sampling method gives an efficient importance sampling formula and the evaluation of both the new
BRDF and the weighting factors for the Monte Carlo integration is computationally cheap. In the rendered test scenes
the computation times did not observably change when using the new BRDF and weighting factors.

Thus fnew (θl , φl ; θv , φv + π) · cos θv attains its maximum in
the mirror direction θv = θl .
In Section 3 we state that the albedo of the new BRDF
is close to 1 for small roughness values and non-flat angles,
and converges to 1 for θl → π/2. Rewriting Equation (13)

D. Geisler-Moroder & A. Dür / A New Ward BRDF Model with Bounded Albedo

Let ε = tan δ and φ, δ as given by Ward’s sampling method
(see Equation (6)). From the spherical coordinates
v = (sin θv cos φv , sin θv sin φv , cos θv ),
h = (ε cos φ, ε sin φ, 1)/ 1 + ε2 ,
and

we compute

By the transformation law for densities and by substituting
Equation (26) into Equation (24) it follows that
a(v) =

Here

denotes the feasible domain where θl < π/2 and thus a sample ray is not rejected.
In the general case, i.e. when ε is small and at non-flat angles
where tan θv is not too large, the albedo is close to 1:
