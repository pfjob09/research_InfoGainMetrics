Abstract
We address the problem of curvature estimation from sampled compact sets. The main contribution is a stability
result: we show that the Gaussian, mean or anisotropic curvature measures of the offset of a compact set K with
positive μ-reach can be estimated by the same curvature measures of the offset of a compact set K’ close to K
in the Hausdorff sense. We show how these curvature measures can be computed for finite unions of balls. The
curvature measures of the offset of a compact set with positive μ-reach can thus be approximated by the curvature
measures of the offset of a point-cloud sample.

1. Introduction
1.1. Motivation
We present in this work a stable notion of curvature. A
common definition of curvature considers quantities defined
pointwisely on a twice differentiable manifold. However, the
objects we have to deal with in practice are not twice differentiable: consider the situation where a physical object
is known through a sufficiently dense point cloud measured
on the object boundary. Intuitively, it seems feasible to infer
some meaningful information on the curvature of the physical object itself. Let us assume that we know both the accuracy of the measure, which is an upper bound on the distances between the measured points and their closest points
on the physical object boundary, and the sampling density,
which is an upper bound on the distance between the points
on the object boundary and their closest measured sample
points. The fact that the measure accuracy and sampling density are below a known small value ε can be expressed by
saying that the Hausdorff distance (see the definition in Section 2) between the assumed physical object and the measured point cloud is less than ε. Even with the guarantee of
a small Hausdorff distance, the knowledge of the measured
point cloud allows many possible shapes for the physical object boundary and it is hopeless, without additional assumpc 2009 The Author(s)

tions, to infer the usual pointwise curvature quantities on the
physical object.
Indeed, a first difficulty is that the geometrical and topological properties of a physical object have to be considered
at some scale: for example, if one is interested in the shape
of a ship hull, it may make sense to see it as a smooth surface at a large scale (10−1 meters). However, at a finer scale
(10−4 meters) this same object may appear with many sharp
features near the rivets and small gaps between assembled
sheets of metals. At a still finer scale, one could even consider each atom as a separate connected component of the
same physical object.
A second difficulty is related to the “pointwise" nature of
usual curvature definition. If the physical object is known
up to ε in Hausdorff distance, it seems impossible to distinguish between the pointwise curvature at two points whose
distance is of the order of ε. Without very strong assumptions
on the regularity of the unknown object, it is again meaningless to evaluate a pointwise curvature quantity.
In this work, we overcome the first difficulty by considering a scale dependent notion of curvature which consists
merely, for a compact set K, in looking at the curvature of
the r-offsets of K (i.e. the set of points at distance less than
or equal to r from K). This offset, which can be seen as a

1486

kind of convolution, in the same spirit of similar operators
in mathematical morphology or image processing, filters out
high frequencies features of the object’s boundary.
We overcome the second difficulty by considering curvature measures instead of pointwise curvature. In the case of
smooths manifolds, curvature measures associate to a subset
of the manifold the integral of pointwise curvatures over the
subset. However the curvature measures are still defined on
non smooth objects such as convex sets or more generally
sets with positive reach [Fed59].
In practice, in order to state our stability theorem, one has
to make some assumption on the unknown physical object,
namely the positive μ-reach property defined below. To be
more precise, our stability theorem still applies to objects
whose offsets have positive μ-reaches.
Some other approaches assume stronger properties such
as smoothness or positive reach. But is it legitimate to make
such assumptions on an unknown object? In practice, the
only available informations about the physical object appears through the physical measures. A distinctive character
of our assumption on the μ-reach of offsets of physical object
is that, thanks to the so-called critical values separation theorem [CCL06], it can be reliably checked from the measured
point sample. In this situation our curvature estimations reflect reliably the intrinsic properties of the physical object.
1.2. Related previous work.
Due to its applications in geometry processing, many methods have been suggested that, given a triangulated surface,
are able to estimate the curvature of an assumed underlying
smooth surface (see [Pet02] for a survey). Several authors
(for example [CP03]) compute the curvature of a smooth
polynomial surface approximating locally the triangulated
surface. Other authors [Hua06, PWY*07, PWHY09] consider integral invariants that allow to estimate curvatures
of underlying smooth objects. Other authors use finite element based methods or laplacians [Dzi88, HPW06, LP05],
statistical approaches [KSNS07] or tensor-fitting approaches
[Rus04]. Cheeger and his coauthors also showed results of
convergence for the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures [CMS86].
Closely related to our work is [Mor08,Coh04,CM03,CM07],
which study a general definition of curvature measure that
applies to both smooth surfaces and their approximation
by triangulated surfaces, based on the so-called normal cycle (defined below). The proximity of curvature measure
is proved using the powerful notion of flat norm [Mor87]
between the corresponding normal cycles. These ideas are
thoroughly reused in the present work.
In [CCL06], in order to address the question of topology
determination through Hausdorff approximation, the authors
have introduced the class of sets with positive μ-reach, which
can be regarded as a mild regularity condition. In particular,
this condition does not require smoothness. If a set has a

positive μ-reach, or at least if it has offsets with positive μreach, it is possible to retrieve the topology of its offset from
the topology of some offsets of a Hausdorff close point sample. A stable notion of normal cone has also been defined on
this class of sets [CCL07]. More recently, the authors have
proved [CCLT07] that the complement of offsets of sets with
positive μ-reach have positive reach. Since the normal cycle
and the associated curvature measures are defined for sets
with positive reach [Fed59, Fu89] we may consider normal
cycles of offsets of sets with positive μ-reach. This paper develops this idea and gives a stability result whose proof uses
the fact that the boundary of the double offsets of sets with
positive μ-reach are smooth surfaces.
1.3. Contributions.
Our main result states that if the Hausdorff distance between two compact sets with positive μ-reach is less than
ε, then √
the curvature measures of their offsets differs by less
that O( ε), using an appropriate notion of distance between
measures. This is then extended through the critical values
separation theorem to the case where only one set has positive μ-reach, which allows to evaluate the curvature measure
of an object from a noisy point cloud sample. These results
improve on the stability results in [Mor08, Coh04, CM03,
CM07], which were only limited to the approximation of
smooth hypersurfaces by homeomorphic triangulated manifolds. In order to provide a concrete algorithm we give the
formulas that express these curvatures measures on a union
of balls (i.e. on an offset of the point cloud). Our experimental results are preliminary and the evaluation on ground truth
surfaces under varying conditions of noise and sampling and
the comparison to other methods are still left open.
Closest to our work is [CCM07], which also gives a stability result for curvature measures. The main differences
are that our result also applies to anisotropic curvature measures, whereas [CCM07] is only limited to the usual curvature measures. On the other hand, the stability result for curvature measures in [CCM07] derives from a stability result
for so-called boundary measures, which holds without any
assumptions on the underlying compact set, whereas ours
requires to assume a lower bound on the μ-reach. While the
two results seem related at first sight, the proof techniques
are drastically different.
1.4. Outline.
The paper first recalls definitions and properties related to
the distance function to a compact set and its gradient, the
critical function and the μ-reach. Then, we introduce the
curvature measures without using the notion of normal cycle, whose formal definition is somewhat lengthy. In Section 3, we state the stability theorem for sets with positive
μ-reaches. We then extend this theorem to the case where
only one set has positive μ-reach. In Section 4, we give the

point x ∈ Rd \ K, we denote by ΓK (x) the set of points in K
closest to x (Figure 1):
ΓK (x) = {y ∈ K | d(x, y) = dK (x)}

2. Definitions and background on distance functions
We are using the following notations in the sequel of this
paper. Given X ⊂ Rd , one denotes by X c the complement
of X, by X its closure and by ∂X the boundary of X. Given
A ⊂ Rd , ch(A) denotes the convex hull of A.

Note that ΓK (x) is a non empty compact set. There is a
unique smallest closed ball σK (x) enclosing ΓK (x) (cf. Figure 1). We denote by θK (x) the center of σK (x) and by FK (x)
its radius. θK (x) can equivalently be defined as the point on
the convex hull of ΓK (x) nearest to x. For x ∈ Rd \ K, the
ΓK (x)

The distance function dK of a compact subset K of Rd associates to each point x ∈ Rd its distance to K:

K
σK (x)

x → dK (x) = min d(x, y),
where d(x, y) denotes the Euclidean distance between x and
y. Conversely, this function characterizes completely the
compact set K since K = {x ∈ Rd | dK (x) = 0}. Note that
dK is 1-Lipschitz. For a positive number r, we denote by
Kr the r-offset of K, defined by Kr = {x | dK (x) ≤ r}. The
Hausdorff distance dH (K, K ) between two compact sets K
and K in Rd is the minimum number r such that K ⊂ Kr and
K ⊂ Kr . The triangular inequality implies that the following
formulae:
dH (K, K ) = sup |dK (x) − dK (x)|

Given a compact subset K of Rd , the medial axis M(K) of
K is the set of points in Rd \ K that have at least two closest
points on K. The infimum distance between K and M(K) is
called, according to Federer, the reach of K and is denoted
reach(K). The reach of K vanishes if K has concave sharp
edges or corners. The projection map pK that associates to a
point x its closest point pK (x) on K is thus defined on Rd \
M(K).
A C 1,1 function is a C 1 function whose first differential is
Lipschitz. A C 1,1 hypersurface S is a (d − 1)-manifold embedded in Rd such that each point of S has a neighborhood
which is the regular image (that is the image by a function
whose differential has maximal rank) by an injective C 1,1
function of a neighborhood of 0 in Rd−1 . Informally, one
can say that a C 1,1 surface is a surface with bounded curvature, which is strictly stronger than C1 and strictly weaker
than C2 . An embedded C 1 compact manifold is C 1,1 if and
only if it has positive reach [Fed59]. Note that a non planar polyedral surface is not of class C 1 , thus does not have
positive reach.
2.1. The gradient
The distance function dK is not differentiable on M(K).
However, it is possible [Lie04] to define a generalized gradient function ∇K : Rd → Rd that coincides with the usual
gradient of dK at points where dK is differentiable. For any
c 2009 The Author(s)

generalized gradient ∇K (x) is defined as follows:
∇K (x) =

x − θK (x)
dK (x)

Note that the definition of ∇K is chosen so that it can
be integrated into a continuous flow [Lie04]. Furthermore,
||∇K (x)|| is the cosine of the (half) angle of the smallest
cone with apex x that contains ΓK (x).
2.2. Critical points, critical function and the μ-reach
The critical points of dK are defined as the points x for which
∇K (x) = 0. Equivalently, a point x is a critical point if and
only if it lies in the convex hull of ΓK (x). When K is finite,
this last definition means that critical points are precisely the
intersections of Delaunay k-dimensional simplices with their
dual (d − k)-dimensional Voronoi facets [GJ03]. Note that
this notion of critical point is the same as the one considered
in the setting of non smooth analysis [Cla83] and Riemannian geometry [Che90, Gro93].
The results of this paper rely strongly on the notions of
critical function and μ-reach, introduced in [CCL06].
Definition 1 (critical function) Given a compact set K ⊂
Rd , its critical function χK : (0, +∞) → R+ is the real function defined by:
χK (d) = inf ||∇K ||
dK−1 (d)

1488

The function χK is lower semicontinuous [Lie04]. The μreach of a compact set K is the maximal offset value d for
which χK (d ) ≥ μ for d < d.

positive reach as the limit of the curvature measures of its
offsets. The advantage of these definitions is that they do not
rely on the notion of normal cycle.

Definition 2 (μ-reach) The μ-reach rμ(K) of a compact set
K ⊂ Rd is defined by:

More precisely, let V be a set with positive reach R > 0
and let t < R. It is known that ∂Vt is a C 1,1 hypersurface
of Rd [Fed59]. The second fundamental form and the principal curvatures of ∂Vt are thus defined almost everywhere.
There is of course no pointwise convergence of the principal
curvatures when t tends to 0. However, the integrals of the
curvatures of ∂Vt converge to the integrals of the curvatures
of V when t tends to 0 (as can be seen for instance using the
tube formula [Fed59]). This allows us to define the isotropic
curvature measures of V for every Borel subset B of Rd as
follows:

rμ(K) = inf{d | χK (d) < μ}
We have that r1 (K) coincides with the reach introduced by
Federer [Fed59]. It can be shown that a polyedron always
has positive μ-reach. For example, the union of two adjacent
triangles in R3 has a positive μ-reach for any μ ≤ cos(β/2)
(where β is the dihedral angle). The critical function is in
some sense “stable” with respect to small (measured by
Hausdorff distance) perturbations of a compact set [CCL06].
That implies the following theorem [CCL06]:
Theorem 1 (critical values separation theorem) Let K and
K be two compact subsets of Rd , dH (K, K ) ≤ ε and μ be a
non-negative number. The distance function dK has no critical values in the interval 4ε/μ2 , rμ(K ) − 3ε . Besides, for
any μ < μ, χK is larger than μ on the interval

2.3. Complement of offsets
It has been proved in [CCLT07] that the complement Krc of
the offset Kr has positive reach for any value 0 < r < rμ.
Moreover, one has a lower bound for the critical function of
Krc :

2.4. Curvature measures
Let us first recall some basic definitions and notations in the
case where M is a smooth surface that is the boundary of a
compact set V of Rd . The unit normal vector at a point p ∈ M
pointing outward V will be refered as n(p). Note that M is
thereby oriented. Given a vector v in the tangent space Tp M
to M at p, the derivative of n in the direction v at p is orthogonal to n(p). The derivative D p n of n at p thus defines an
endomorphism of Tp M, known as the Weingarten endomorphism. The Weingarten endomorphism is symmetric. The
associated quadratic form is called the second fundamental
form. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Weingarten endomorphism are respectively called principal directions and
principal curvatures. In the 3-dimensional case, both principal curvatures can be recovered from the trace and determinant of D p n, also called mean and Gaussian curvature.
It is possible to define the curvature measures of a set with

sk (p)d p

where 1B is the indicator function of B. Therefore, we can
extend this notion of curvature measure to any integrable
real function. This point of view is crucial and will allow
us to state simple results of stability in this paper. More precisely, one defines the isotropic curvature measure for every
integrable function f on Rd by:
ΦVk ( f ) = lim

Z

t→0 ∂Vt

f (pV (p)) sk (p)d p.

Similarly, one extends the notion of anisotropic curvature
measure of [Coh04, CM03]: the anisotropic curvature measure of V associates to any integrable function f the d × d
symmetric matrix defined by:
H V ( f ) = lim

Z

t→0 ∂Vt

f (pV (p)) H∂Vt (p)d p,

where H∂Vt is a matrix-valued function defined on Rd that
coincides with the second fundamental form of ∂Vt on the
tangent space, and vanishes on the orthogonal component.
Now, let K be a compact set whose μ-reach is greater than
r > 0. Then V = Krc has a reach greater than μr. It is then possible to define the extended notions of curvature measures of
Kr (see [RZ01, RZ03] for more details) by:
ΦkKr ( f ) = (−1)k ΦVk ( f ) and

H Kr ( f ) = −H V ( f ).

In the 3-dimensional case, it is also possible to define a second anisotropic measure curvature H by:
H V ( f ) = lim

Z

t→0 ∂Vt

f (pV (p)) H∂Vt (B)

H∂Vt , but with swapped eigenvalues on the tangent plane, and
vanishes on the orthogonal component of ∂Vt .
3. Stability results
3.1. Curvature measures of the offsets
The main contribution of this paper is Theorem 3. Thanks to
the formulation of the curvature measures with measurable
functions, the statement is simple. This theorem states that if
two compact sets K and K with positive μ-reaches are close
in the Hausdorff sense, then the curvature measures of their
offsets are close. We recall that the covering number N (A,t)
of a compact set A is the minimal number of closed balls of
radius t needed to cover A.
Theorem 3 Let K and K be two compact sets of Rd whose
μ-reaches are greater than r. We suppose that the Hausdorff distance
ε = dH (K, K ) between K and K is less than
√
rμ (2− 2)

min(μ, 12 ). If f : Rd → R is a Lipschitz function
2
satisfying | f | ≤ 1, then:
√
|ΦiKr ( f ) − ΦiKr ( f )| ≤ k(r, μ, d, f ) sup(Lip( f ), 1) ε,
and
H Kr ( f ) − H Kr ( f ) ≤ k(r, μ, d, f ) sup(Lip( f ), 1)

√

where k(r, μ, d, f ) only depends on f through the covering number N (spt( f )O(√ε) , μr/2); Lip( f ) is the Lipschitzconstant of f ; spt( f ) = {x ∈ Rd , f (x) = 0}.
We recall that spt( f )O(√ε) denotes an offset of spt( f ) of pa√
rameter O( ε).The proof of this theorem is given in Section
5. We show in Figure 3 that this bound is tight. Furthermore,
c 2009 The Author(s)

Now, if we take the function f (x) = max(1 − x − c /r, 0)
equal to 1 at a point c ∈ ∂Kr that radially decreases in a
“small" ball B of radius r and vanishes out of B, then we
can get local information about the curvature of Kr from the
curvature of Kr in the neighborhood of c.
We also note that the conclusion of the theorem may be
rephrased by saying that the bounded Lipschitz distance between
√ the curvature measures of Kr and Kr is bounded by
O( ε). The bounded Lipschitz distance between measures
is similar to the Wasserstein distance (also called earth’s
mover distance), except that it applies to general signed measures whereas Wasserstein distance is limited to probability
measures. We refer to [CCM07] for precise definitions.
3.2. General result
The result of the previous section ensuring the stability of the
curvature measures assume that both the compact sets K and
K have sufficiently large μ-reach. Nevertheless, in practical
settings, particularly when dealing with point clouds, such
a hypothesis is rarely satisfied. Using Theorem 1, it is still
possible to approximate the curvature measures of the offsets
of a compact set with positive μ-reach from any sufficiently
close approximation of it.
Theorem 4 Let K and K be two compact subsets of Rd
such that rμ(K ) > r. Assume that the Hausdorff distance
ε = dH (K, K ) between K and K is such that ε <
Then the conclusions of Theorem 3 also hold.

Of course, if for s > 0, the compact set K satisfies rμ(Ks ) >
c > 0, the same theorem applies to Ks . Furthermore, thanks
to Theorem 1, the value of rμ(Ks ) can be read on the critical
function of the sample K.
Proof It follows from Theorem 1 (the critical values separation theorem of [CCL06]) that the critical function of K

for all 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1 − x ≥ 1 − 2x ) that this inequality is
implied by the assumption made on ε. The theorem now follows immediately from Theorem 3.
4. Computation of the curvature measures of 3D point
clouds
When the compact K is a finite set of points in R3 it is
possible to provide explicit formula for the curvature measures. Although the description and the analysis of a robust
and efficient algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper, we
show how curvature measures of a 3D point cloud can be
computed in practice. We also provide some illustrating experimental results obtained by implementing the method described in this section.
Let K ⊂ R3 be a finite set of points and let r > 0. To avoid
technicalities, we assume that the set of balls of radius r and
centered in K are in general position (as in [EM94]): no 4
centers lie on a common plane; no 5 centers lie on a common
sphere; and the smallest sphere through any 2, 3 or 4 centers
of K has a radius different from r. In the 3-dimensional case,
1
we denote by ΦH
Kr = ΦKr the mean curvature measure and
G
2
by ΦKr = ΦKr the Gaussian curvature measure. The compuH
tation of ΦG
Kr and ΦKr is done in three main steps described
in the following paragraphs.
4.1. Computation of the boundary of a union of balls
The boundary of Kr is a spherical polyhedron: its faces are
spherical polygons; its edges are circle arcs contained in the
intersection of pairs of spheres of radius r with centers in K;
its vertices belong to the intersection of three spheres of radius r with centers in K. Moreover, the combinatorial structure of ∂Kr is easily deduced from an α-shape of K. Indeed,
it follows from Lemma 2.2 in [Ede93] that it is in one-toone correspondence with the boundary of the α-shape of K
for α = r: faces (that may not be connected nor simply connected) of the former are in one-to-one correspondence with
vertices of the latter; edges and vertices are in correspondence with edges and faces respectively. As a consequence,
the combinatorial structure of ∂Kr is easily deduced from
the computation of the α-shape of K. Getting the geometric structure of ∂Kr is more tricky since it requires to com-

mal is pointing outside. Notice that ΦG
Kr (C) and ΦKr (C) are
proportional to either the area, or the length, or the Dirac
measure of C (depending on if C is a face or an edge or a
vertex). As a consequence, once computed on each cell C of
H
∂Kr , the values ϕG
Kr (C) and ϕKr (C) can simply be stored by
adding an extra information to the elements of the data structure representing ∂Kr . These values will then be used for the
integration (in step 3.).

4.3. Computing the curvatures for Lipschitz functions
Let now f be a Lipschitz function on Rd . To compute the
H
curvature measures ΦG
Kr ( f ) and ΦKr ( f ) of the union of balls
Kr , we triangulate ∂Kr . More precisely, we triangulate every
face C of ∂Kr into “small" spherical patches of diameter less
than η. We then approximate f by a function f˜ that is constant equal to ki on each “small" patch Δi and that coincides
with f in at least one point of each patch. We then calculate
the isotropic curvature measures with f˜ “above the face" C
by using Proposition 1:

colorbar on the right, the blue color corresponding to the lowest
values.

Similarly, by using Proposition 1, we calculate the isotropic
curvature measures above the “spherical edges" with a function f˜ piecewise constant on “small" edges of lengths less
than η. Finally, we calculate exactly the isotropic curvature
measures “above" the vertices by using Proposition 1. A simple calculation shows that the numerical error done by approximating f by a piecewise constant function f˜ is then
given by:

where k is a constant depending only on the “size" of the
support of f and on Kr .

Figure 5: The Gauss (left) and mean (right) curvatures computed
on the offset of a point cloud sampled around a non smooth mechanical part (model is provided courtesy of INRIA and ISIT by the
AIM@SHAPE Shape Repository). One clearly sees that the mean
curvature detects all the sharp edges as highly curved parts while
the Gauss curvatures only detects the curved sharp edges. Notice
that the positively curved corners are well-detected by the Gauss
curvature.

4.4. Experimental results
In the figures 4, 5 and 6 below, the curvatures have been
computed using the following algorithm:

the anisotropic curvature measures for a finite set of points
(see [CCLT08]). In particular, this allows to estimate the
principal curvatures and principal directions from a cloud

placed by a constant k(r, μ, d, N ), where N is the covering
number of the offset Kr .
In the following, we use classical notions concerning
Hausdorff measures and rectifiable currents (see for instance
[Mor87] for more details). The proof also strongly relies on
the notion of double offset and on the notion of normal cycle
of a set of positive reach that we define now. Let V be a set
with positive reach. We define the set:
S(V ) = {(p, n) ∈ Rd × Sd−1 , p ∈ ∂V and n ∈ NC(p)},
→
px ≤ 0} is the norwhere NC(p) = {n ∈ Sd−1 , ∀x ∈ V n.−

mal cone of V at p. One can show that S(V ) is a Lipschitz
(d-1)-manifold. The normal cycle N(V ) of V is then by definition [Fu89] the (d-1)-current on Rd × Rd associated with
the manifold S(V ). We recall that currents are linear forms
on the space of differential forms. In our case, this linear
form is defined for every (d-1)-differential form ω by:
N(V )(ω) =

Z

S(V )

ω.

Figure 6: The Gauss (upper row) and mean (lower row) curvatures
computed on the offset of a point cloud sampled around a horse
model.

The normal cycle contains in fact all the curvature information and allows to define the curvature measures (see
[CM03, CM07, Fu89]). For example, the mean curvature
measure φVH ( f ) in dimension 3 is given by N(V )( f¯ωH )
where f¯(p, n) = f (p) and ωH is a particular 2-differential
form on R3 × R3 , that does not depend on V .
Our proof consists in comparing the normal cycles of the
complements of the offsets of compact sets K and K . These
are well-defined thanks to the following result obtained in
[CCLT07]. For 0 < t < r, the (r,t)-double offset Kr,t of K is
the set defined by Kr,t = (Kr )c t .
Theorem 5 (Double offset theorem) Let K be a compact set
with μ-reach greater than r. Then, Krc has reach at least μr
and if t < μr, ∂Kr,t is a smooth C 1,1 -hypersurface. Moreover
the reach of ∂Kr,t is greater than min(t, μr − t).

Figure 7: The Gauss (upper row) and mean (lower row) curvatures computed on the offset of a point cloud sampled around a nonmanifold set union of a cube with a disc and a circle. As expected,
the vertices and the boundary of the disc have a large Gaussian
curvature.

The proof can now be divided into three steps: in the first
step, we show that the problem can be carried onto the double offsets (the advantage being that they are smooth); in a
second step, we compare the normal cycles of the double offsets; in the last step, we combine Step 1 and Step 2 to show
that the curvature measures of the two offsets are close. Let
K and K be two compact sets with positive μ-reach that satisfy all the assumptions of Theorem 3.
Step 1: Carrying the problem to the double offsets

First note that Krc and Kr have positive reach. We introduce
the map:

one has:

where F−t is the map induced by F−t at the level of currents.

Step 2: Comparison of the normal cycles of the double
offsets
In order to compare the normal cycles of Kr,t and Kr,t , we
first need to compare their supports in Rd × Rd (that is, the
associated manifolds), which is the purpose of the following
lemmas.

Proof For ρ such that 0 < ρ < t, we denote by GX (x, ρ), as in
section 5 of [CCL07], the convex hull for every y ∈ B(x, ρ) of
all the “classical" gradients ∇X (y) of the distance function
dX . By using Theorem 5.6 in [CCL07], we have that:

μ-reaches are greater than r. Then for every t ∈ (0, rμ), we
have:

On another hand we know ( [Fed59] page 435) that the proR
-Lipschitz for points at disjection map πX on X is R−(t+ρ)
tance less than (t + ρ) from X. Then, for y ∈ B(x, ρ) one has

d(x, y) ≤ ρ and d(πX (x), πX (y)) ≤ R−(t+ρ)
and:

with μ˜ -reach greater than r, such that dH (A, B) ≤ ε˜ , one has:

We apply again Equation (2) with A = (Kr )c and B = (Kr )c

Remark also that for any compact sets A and B, one has

Applying the previous lemma with X = Krc and X = K cr
shows that the difference between the normals of ∂Kr,t and
∂Kr,t is bounded by 30 ε/(μt). Combining the last two results, we get that the supports of N(Kr,t ) and N(Kr,t ) are
close to each other. This allows to show that N(Kr,t ) and
N(Kr,t ) are close. More precisely:
Lemma 3 We can write
N(Kr,t ) − N(Kr,t ) = ∂E,

Here Hk denotes the k-dimensional Hausdorff measure (i.e.
the k-volume), and the mass is the corresponding concept for
currents [Mor87].
Proof The current E is built as follows. First, the closest point projection defines a homeomorphism from ∂Kr,t
to ∂Kr,t , because the Hausdorff distance between these two
manifolds is less than their reach. This homeomorphism can
be lifted to a homeomorphism ψ between the supports of
the corresponding normal cycles. Current E is then defined
as the volume swept by the linear interpolation between the
identity of the support of N(Kr,t ) and the latter homeomorphism. Formally, we define h as the affine homotopy between ψ and the identity

the obtained bound does not take advantage of the fact that f
might have a small support. In [CCLT08], the proof is done
locally in a Borel set that contains the support of the function
f : this gives a better bound with the covering number of an
offset of the support of f ; however, the proof is more complicated since a second current (related to the boundary of
B ∩ ∂Kr,t , where B is the chosen Borel set) appears in Equation (5).

8. Conclusion and future work
We have introduced the first notion of anisotropic curvature
measure which is Hausdorff stable and applies to a large
class of objects, including non manifold and non smooth sets
as well as point clouds. Indeed, it is enough to require that
some offset has a positive μ-reach, or, equivalently that the
critical function of the set is greater than some positive number μ on some interval.
In light of these results, one can introduce a scale dependent variant of the normal cycle. We say that a compact set
K ⊂ Rd satisfies the (Pα ) property if its critical function is
greater than some positive μ on an open interval containing
α > 0. For such K, we define the α-normal cycle as the rectifiable (d − 1)-current of Rd × Sd−1 , Nα (K) = F−α N(Kα ).
The effect of push-forward F−α is to move the support of
the normal cycle closer to K: in simple cases (but not in general) Nα (K) is equal to the normal cycle of the double offset
Kα,α c . This current captures in some sense the curvature information at scale α and has two nice properties. First, it
coincides with the usual normal cycle for sets with positive
reach, more precisely, if a compact set K has a reach greater
than α, then Nα (K) = N(K). Second it is Hausdorff stable,
more precisely, if K satisfies (Pα ), then there are constants C
and ε0 > 0 depending only on K such that if K is a compact
set such that dH (K, K√) < ε ≤ ε0 then Nα (K) and Nα (K )
differ by less than C ε in the so-called flat norm (see for
example [Mor87, FX02] for a definition), which
√implies that
the associated curvature measures are also O ε close.
We think of several possible future directions. First we
think of extending our paradigm to the measure of higher order quantities such as torsion of curves or curvature derivatives. A possible track to define a stable measure for these

higher order quantities is to integrate the gradient of a Gaussian function again the normal cycle: this would retrieve informations about the gradient of curvature measure. Associated stability results require more investigations.

Furthermore, although the practical setting is beyond the
scope of this paper, we obtain promising results for the estimation of the curvature measures from a noisy point cloud
sample and we expect potential applications in the context
of point cloud modeling.
