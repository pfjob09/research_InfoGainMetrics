Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatic generation of visualizations from domain-specific data
available on the web. We describe a general system pipeline that combines ontology mapping and probabilistic
reasoning techniques. With this approach, a web page is first mapped to a Domain Ontology, which stores the
semantics of a specific subject domain (e.g., music charts). The Domain Ontology is then mapped to one or more
Visual Representation Ontologies, each of which captures the semantics of a visualization style (e.g., tree maps). To
enable the mapping between these two ontologies, we establish a Semantic Bridging Ontology, which specifies the
appropriateness of each semantic bridge. Finally each Visual Representation Ontology is mapped to a visualization
using an external visualization toolkit. Using this approach, we have developed a prototype software tool, SemViz,
as a realisation of this approach. By interfacing its Visual Representation Ontologies with public domain software
such as ILOG Discovery and Prefuse, SemViz is able to generate appropriate visualizations automatically from a
large collection of popular web pages for music charts without prior knowledge of these web pages.

1. Introduction
Visualization is one of the indispensable means for addressing the rapid explosion of data and information. Although
a large collection of visualization techniques have been developed over the past three decades, the majority of ordinary users, who handle data and information everyday, have
little knowledge about these techniques. Despite there being many interactive visualization tools (e.g., ILOG Discovery [BHS04], Prefuse [HCL05], Spotfire [Ahl96]) available
in the public domain or commercially, producing visualizations remains a skilled and time-consuming task.
One approach for cost-effective dissemination of visualization techniques is to use captured expert knowledge for
helping ordinary users generate visualizations automatically.
To some users, this approach may serve as an introduction to
new visualization techniques or an initial overview of possible styles of visualizations, which is followed by a more
intensive interaction to create finely-tuned and customised
visualizations. To others, this approach may provide an adequate visualization service without consuming excessive effort to learn and utilise the various visualization tools directly.

The method of “design galleries” [MAB∗ 97], placed the
first footprint in this direction. However, for visualizations
with a very large parameter space, the method generally requires a long, iterative process involving the user before the
search converges on a satisfactory result. In this work, we
propose to use ontologies, which represent captured expert
knowledge, to reduce the parameter space, providing a more
effective automated solution to the dissemination of visualization techniques to ordinary users. As an example, we consider the visualization of music chart data on the web, and
aim to generate visualizations automatically from the data.
We present an ontology-based pipeline to map tabular data
to geometrical data, and to select appropriate visualization
tools, styles and parameters, producing formatted data that
can be fed to the visualization tools automatically to generate visualizations.
The novel design of this pipeline features three ontologies,
namely a domain ontology (DO) for storing domain knowledge about the source data (i.e., music charts in this work), a
visual representation ontology (VRO) for storing the knowledge about visualization tools, styles and parameter space,
and a semantic bridging ontology (SBO) for storing the
knowledge about the mapping from DO to VRO. We use a

(a) The trial and error methodology [YaKSJ07] relies on
the interaction between users and the visualization system
to derive satisfactory results with minimum assistance from
the computer. A large collection of visualization tools (e.g.,
SpotFire [Ahl96] and ILOG Discovery [BHS04]) support
this approach by providing fast rendering and effective exploration of the visual space.

probabilistic ontology mapping technique loosely based on
OMEN (Ontology Mapping Enhancer) [MNJ05] to realise
the automatic data mapping within the pipeline, and create
interfaces between the pipeline and two popular visualization tools, ILOG Discovery [BHS04] and Prefuse [HCL05].
Figure 1 shows an example web page containing the iTunes
Store song chart, and visualizations generated by ILOG Discovery and Prefuse automatically via our pipeline.
In the remainder of the paper, we give an overview of related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we present an overview
of the main components of our pipeline. In Section 4, we detail the three main ontologies, followed by a description of
the ontology mapping algorithm in Section 5. We present
and discuss our results in Section 6, and provide our concluding remarks in Section 7.
2. Related Work
There are four main methodologies commonly deployed in
the visualization process, the first three were discussed in
[PLB∗ 01].

(b) The design galleries methodology [MAB∗ 97] is a
data-centric approach that relies on limited knowledge of
any underlying data model. With some basic knowledge of
the application domain and visualization tool (i.e., volume
visualization in [MAB∗ 97]), the visualization system automatically selects parameters and generates a set of visualizations, from which users select the most relevant and useful
visualizations. This process is repeated until satisfactory visualizations are obtained in a manner resembling the semiautomatic genetic algorithm.
(c) The information-assisted methodology relies on some
understanding of the underlying model of the data. It extracts
more abstract information from the data (e.g., histogram
[YMC05], cluster [GDGL07] and topology [WBP07]), and
uses it to guide users in their interactive visualization process. Methodologies (b) and (c) involves partial automation,
but users’ interaction is an essential part of the process.
(d) The automatic visualization methodology attempts
to generate visual representations from data automatically.
[Fei85] and [Mac86] first set the agenda for this research
direction. [MHS07] presented a set of user interface commands, “Show Me”, as part of the user interface of Tableau,
providing a number of automated functions in user interaction. In comparison with the other three methodologies, this
approach is least studied.
Music chart data is a relatively simple form of data, but
varies greatly in data organisation, terminology used, and
levels of details. Many general purpose tools for non-spatial
data (or information) visualization can be used to create
appropriate visualizations by hand. There are also visualization tools which are tailored towards music. CoMIRVA
[SKSP07] contains a powerful set of functionalities that are
able to produce music visualizations in a variety of styles.
Through its user interface, a skilled user can create impressive visualizations from music meta-data stores and digital
audio files as long as they conform to accepted formats.
There are some 15 other music visualization tools for performance, tune, pitch etc. All these are based primarily on
methodology (a).
Ontologies are used in domains such as knowledge engineering, enterprise data sharing and the semantic web. Due
to the heterogeneity of these systems, translating between
ontologies is of great importance and is known as Ontology
Mapping, Matching or Alignment [ES07]. The large size of
a typical ontology means that automatic ontology mapping
is essential. Techniques use a combination of similarity, distance, structure and external semantics. Our work looks at

automatic ontology mapping from the perspective of probabilistic techniques [MNJ05], [TLL∗ 06].
Ontologies have been considered in visualization.
[DBDH05] suggested the need to build an ontology of visualization to capture the concepts and characteristics of visualization. [RKR06] developed a web application for categorising and storing information about systems for software
visualization. There are also studies on visualization techniques for displaying ontological structures (e.g. [FSvH04],
[BBP05], [KHL∗ 07]), which is not the focus of this work.
Our work falls into the same scope of [DBDH05] and
[RKR06], but we have gone a step further by proposing to
use concepts and knowledge stored in ontologies to facilitate
automatic generation of visualizations. Hence, we are pursuing the same goals as the above-mentioned previous work in
the scope of methodology (d), but by employing more powerful and systematic tools, that is, ontologies and ontology
mapping.
3. System Overview
We have developed a prototype, SemViz which is able to
produce an end-to-end automatic visualization of tabulated
data from a selection of music chart web pages. SemViz
allows the mapping algorithm’s parameters to be adjusted
and includes custom code for interfacing to the visualization toolkits. We choose to output visualizations using either
the ILOG Discovery or Prefuse visualization toolkits. The
pipeline stages (figure 2) are as follows:

1. Extract Tabulated Source Data from Web Page If an
XML or CSV link to the tabulated data is not provided,
a screen-scraper/data extractor such as Solvent and Piggy
Bank [HMK07] can be applied.
2. Perform Instance-level Data Analysis on Source Data
This stage is optional, but can be used to augment the Domain Ontology, particularly if there is a large amount of
data where valuable semantics can be usefully extracted.
3. Create the Source Data to Domain Ontology Mappings
This component uses string similarity measures of the
data column and domain ontology concept names and
also the instance data to probabilistically reason on the
most likely mappings. Each mapping permutation is
scored and the top n of the possible permutations are
stored. This is a schema mapping process.
4. Create the Domain Ontology to VRO Mappings
Depending on which concepts in the Domain Ontology
have been stimulated by the Source Data, the Mapper
uses the rules stored in the Semantic Bridging Ontology
to create mappings which aim to result in useful visualizations. Each mapping permutation is scored, and the
top m of the permutations are stored. This is a schema
mapping process. The Ontology Mapping algorithm is
described in Section 5.
5. Execute the Mappings With the top n permutations
from stage 3 and m permutations from stage 4, this results
in n × m possible mapping permutations. Each permutation is given a score, they are ranked, and the highest 10
scoring permutations are combined with the original tabulated source data to form 10 VRO instances. In SemViz,
10 are chosen as a good trade-off. The 10 VRO instances
are converted into the specific files necessary for each Visualization toolkit supported by the system.
6. Generate Visualizations The toolkits are invoked and
the visualizations are generated before being presented to
the user.
4. Ontologies
An ontology provides an explicit conceptualisation (i.e.,
meta-information) that describes the semantics of data
[Fen01]. A language for defining ontologies is syntactically
and semantically richer than other common approaches (e.g.
databases). An ontology consists of concepts, relationships
and attributes. This can be seen in Figure 3. Concepts (circles) are related via relations (arrows). For example, an
“Artist” concept is related to a “Song” concept via a “has”
relation. A concept can also have attributes (rectangles in
the diagram). For example, an “Artist” concept has an “isPrimaryKey” attribute.
The ontologies used in SemViz were developed using
Stanford’s Protege tool [NSD∗ 01] and are expressed in
RDF/OWL [LS98]. In the following worked example, we
use the BBC’s top 40 web page visualized as a 2D Graph.
We restrict the diagrams to show only stimulated concepts
and also the strongly weighted relationships.

The DO for the Music Charts area is shown in Figure 3.
Each relationship and attribute has a strength value which
is a real number between 0 (weakest) and 1 (strongest). The
only exception to this is the “priorityWrt” (priority with respect to) relationship which is 0.5 if the two linked concepts are of equal priority, or > 0.5 if the source concept
has a higher priority than the target concept. The system
records all relationships and attributes, no matter how strong
or weak. In fact, there are relationships between every concept. These are present because the pipeline is based on
probabilistic reasoning where we score permutations in order to decide on the best mapping. In general, a DO is initially created by a domain expert who “primes” the ontology
with appropriate values for the relationship strengths.
The first mapping stage of SemViz is between the Tabulated Source Data and the DO (stage 3 in Figure 2). This
process uses string similarity (Levenshtein distance) to measure the likelihood of a column in the source data having
a match with a concept in the DO. String similarity is performed on both the column/concept names and the instance
data. The DO keeps a record of concept name history (synonyms attribute) and instance value history (instanceHistory
attribute). The score for the mapping of a column to a con-

The purpose of the Domain Ontology is to store the semantics of the subject area which the source web page covers.
The semantics are derived in such a way that they can be easily mapped to artefacts in the Visual Representation Ontology (VRO) (see section 4.2). This is done by defining a controlled set of relationships and attributes for use in both the
DO and VRO. Some of the relationships and attributes have
semantic equivalence. This forms the basis of our ability to
map between DO concepts (i.e. data entities) and VRO concepts (i.e. visual artefacts) and therefore produce cognitively
useful visualizations. Table 1 lists the relationships and attributes used in the DO and VRO, together with their semantic equivalence (if applicable). Note that these relationships
and attributes are general in that they can be applied to any
new DO instance (e.g. car records) or VRO instance (e.g. 3D
Graph) which may be added to the SemViz system.

cept is based on the top similarities of the concept name synonyms plus the proportion of historical instances which are
the same as the instances in the source. The second mapping stage between the DO and VRO is more involved and
is discussed in Section 5.
In Figure 3 it can be seen that the BBC Top 40 charts
web page has been mapped to the “Artist”, “Song”, “Current
Chart Position”, “Last Week Chart Position”, and “Weeks In
Chart” concepts in the DO. These 5 concepts are known as
the stimulated concepts of the DO.
4.2. Visual Representation Ontology (VRO)
The VRO captures the semantics of a particular visual representation (e.g. 2D Graph). It does this by modelling visual
artefacts (e.g. X coordinate, Y coordinate, Colour, etc.) as
concepts and the relationships between them. In this way, we
can match relationships in the DO with relationships which
have semantic equivalence in the VRO. We can also perform
a similar task with semantically equivalent attributes.
We have built VRO’s for 2D graphs (see Figure 4),
TreeMaps, Parallel Coordinates and Graph Networks. The
major source of information during the domain modelling
exercise was ILOG Discovery. The user interface has a Projection Inspector which allows users to control the mappings between source data entities (e.g. “Current Chart Position”) and target visualization artefacts (e.g. “X coordinate”). ILOG Discovery’s Projection Inspector therefore
provides a good source of executable and pragmatic semanc 2008 The Author(s)

4.3. Semantic Bridging Ontology (SBO)
The purpose of the SBO is to capture and store the available
expert knowledge about how various subject domains can be
usefully visualized by different visual representations. This
allows the complexity of the number of mapping permutations to be reduced. It also allows the accuracy of the scoring
algorithm to be increased (see Section 5). The SBO is made
up of Semantic Bridge concepts (or “semantic bridges”).
Each semantic bridge records a single mapping between a
DO concept (data entity) and a VRO concept (visual artefact), together with its appropriateness value. In this way,
the SBO is a fully-connected graph of all possible permutations between the DO(s) and the VRO(s) in the system. By
default, the appropriateness given to each semantic bridge is
100. However, this value can be increased or decreased to reflect specific expert knowledge. The SBO shown in Figure 5
highlights the semantic bridges which have non-default appropriateness values.

5. Ontology Mapping
The algorithm we employ to score the mapping permutations from the DO to VRO is loosely based on a version
of the OMEN (Ontology Mapping ENhancer) algorithm described in [MNJ05]. OMEN uses a set of meta-rules that
capture the influence of the ontology structure and the semantics of ontology relations to match nodes that are neighbours of already matched nodes in two ontologies. Instead of
a Bayesian network (which cannot easily be defined by experts), we use the SBO to manage the complexity and scalability of the mapping process.
It is possible to consider all permutations between concepts from DO to VRO. However, this leads to an algorithm
with a factorial computational complexity. Therefore, for
non-trivial examples, the number of permutations to check
quickly becomes unwieldy. To reduce the number of permutations, we use the SBO to ensure that only a subset of the
permutations will be considered - those with semantic bridge
appropriateness values over a pre-determined threshold. This
expert knowledge can also be used by the scoring algorithm.
With respect to the base example in Figure 6, let θ be the
mapping from DO to VRO, so:
V = θ(D)
V ′ = θ(D′ )

If we wish to find wD (the weighting of the concept pair
mapping in this permutation in θ), we known that D to D′
has a relationship of type qD′ . We also known that V to V ′
has a relationship of type qV′ ′ . If qD′ and qV′ ′ have semantic
equivalence, qD′ ∼ qV′ ′ (see table 1) then we can compare the
strength values: sD′ and tV ′ . The closer these strength values
are to each other, the higher the probability of them being
equivalent. In order to get wD , we apply a “fitness function”
which takes the two strength values as parameters (s and t).
In the example visualizations in this paper, we use the first
fitness function ( f1 ).
The overall score given to the whole permutation, totalwθ
(indicating the calculated cognitive value of the visualization) is the sum of all concept pair weight values. This is
formalised as:

∑

wD =

f1 (sD′ ,tV ′ )

D′ =D

∑

totalwθ =

wD

D∈DO

where
f1 (s,t) := 1 − |s − t|
Other fitness functions are possible, such as f 2 , which takes
into account the size of the values of s and t.

An alternative version of totalwθ takes into account the
appropriateness value (aDV ) stored in the SBO.

The approach of using a SBO allows us to reduce the permutation search space while utilising existing domain and
visualization knowledge.

Music Chart DO. Bottom: Instance-based semantics derived
from the source data by the Data Analysis module.
6. Results and Remarks
6.1. Instance vs. Schema-level Categorisation
There are two methods of deducing the semantics of the web
page source data:
1. Schema-level Categorisation. The semantics of each concept in the Domain Ontology are pre-defined. We use
these semantics to calculate an effective mapping between the DO and VRO.
2. Instance-level Categorisation. An analysis of the actual
values of the source data provides semantics. This analysis can optionally be performed by the Data Analysis module (see stage 2 in Figure 2) during a first pass
through the visualization pipeline.
In Figure 7 we see the effects of the two methods on the
visualization of the iTunes music chart using a TreeMap. The
top visualization uses the DO as defined (schema level). This
shows a Country → Artist → Song hierarchy. The second
uses an instance level analysis to augment and override the
DO. As such, we have an Artist → Song → Country hierarchy. This is because the Data Analyser deduces that a Song
“has” a Country, rather than a Country “has” an Artist. For
the iTunes Store music chart, the second method produces
a cognitively more valuable visualization compared to the
first method which doesn’t provide much more insight over
the original web page’s table of data.

6.2. The Gallery Selection Methodology

25.42
25.42

The gallery interaction methodology [MAB∗ 97] presents
the user with multiple visualisations for one data set. This
is based on the principle of the user being able to choose
which visualization is most applicable for their needs. The
ontology-based pipeline we present in this paper lends itself
to this style of interaction. Since the result of the pipeline
is a probabilistic score for each possible mapping permutation, we can present the user with a manageable set of the
best visualizations. This is shown as scored thumbnail visualizations in Figure 8. The benefits of the gallery selection
methodology are:
• the user gets “something” to see, even if the certainty of
its appropriateness is low.
• the visualization thumbnails which the user selects provides the system with feedback on the mapping decisions
which were made. This provides the basis for a learning
system based on users’ interactions.
6.3. Comprehending Automatically Created
Visualizations
At the top of Figure 8, we show the highest scoring visualization for the BBC Top 40 webpage. Nearest to the origin, we
can clearly see a cluster of shapes just below the X=Y line,
representing those songs which have fallen least since the
previous week. Shapes along the X-axis represent new song
entries since they have no value (zero) for “Last Week”.
Notice that the six visualizations with the highest scores
have a diagonal line (X = Y ) overlaid on the visualization.
SemViz has automatically instructed ILOG Discovery to
draw this line to assist the end-user with observing trends. A
rule exists in the system which states that when a mapping
permutation’s concept pairs pertaining to the the X coordinate and the Y coordinate have a complements value greater
than a certain threshold, then there is a benefit in drawing
the user’s attention to the placement of shapes relative to the
X = Y line. Therefore, for this particular permutation, an assistance line is drawn.
7. Conclusions
We have described a pragmatic method of producing automatic visualizations using domain knowledge captured in
ontologies. The Domain Ontology (DO) captures knowledge
about the source web pages’ subject domain; the Visual Representation Ontologies (VRO) capture the semantics of popular visual representations/styles; and the Semantic Bridging
Ontology (SBO) holds key knowledge about the relationships between data entities of the source subject domain and
the visual artefacts of the target visualizations. We have rationalised the relationships between concepts in the DO and
VRO into a core set of semantic equivalences which form
the basis of the scoring algorithm.

We have adapted an existing ontology mapping algorithm
to encompass probabilistic relationships. This algorithm has
a good trade-off between computational cost and ability to
produce high quality automatic visualizations. We have implemented the visualization pipeline in a prototype, SemViz
which functions end-to-end from source web page to target
visualization. SemViz interfaces with two public-domain visualization frameworks.
We have shown demonstrable results by taking music
chart web pages and using SemViz to interface with the
ILOG Discovery and Prefuse visualization toolkits to produce examples in a variety of popular visualization styles.
The visualization pipeline and supporting data-structures
provide a good framework on which to extend and refine the
current ontology mapping algorithm.
