Abstract

management and would experience lower transaction costs.
Because of the many benefits provided by mutual funds,
this sector has witnessed tremendous growth in the past two
decades. As of October 2007, there are 8,015 mutual funds
that belong to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), the
national association of investment companies in the United
States. These funds have combined assets of $12.356 trillion. In comparison, the total market capitalization of all
companies in the world was US$51 trillion in March 2007,
according to Reuters [11] .
However, there is a wide variation in mutual fund characteristics. Funds vary in size and cash holdings. Further,
they have different fee structures: some funds charge loads
while others do not. Some funds managers try to time the
market and trade more often, while some others tend to hold
a more long-term view and trade less. How do these fund
characteristics affect fund performance?
This question has considerably attracted interest of financial economists and practitioners. The conventional wisdom in the investment industry is that fund performance is
negatively associated with asset size, expense ratios, and
portfolio turnover, while it is independent of the load/noload status. However, researchers examining the relation
between fund performance and fund properties have yet to
produce conclusive findings. For example, Ippolito [5] finds
that load funds commonly outperform no-load funds, while
Chen et al. [1] find no performance difference between load
and no-load funds. Droms and Walker [2] find no relation between fund performance and asset size, turnover, or
load/no-load status; but they find that funds with higher expense ratios have higher returns. On the other hand, a study
by Morningstar Inc. finds that funds with higher turnovers
have lower returns [10].
In this paper, we propose a visualization-based method
to help domain professionals to analyze the critical relations
and make decisions in fund selection. Our method is based
on a new visual tool, density-based distribution map, to depict massive mutual funds information on screens with limited size and resolution. From a real world fund database
(U.S. stock fund data during the year 2006), all the funds

Mutual funds are probably the most important investment instruments for investors. Their performance is mainly
affected by their characteristics, such as asset size, turnover
and fee structure. It is thus of the investors’ highest priorities to understand the relation between fund performance
and these properties. Typically, financial researchers use
the linear regression technique to statistically assess the
relation from massive fund performance data. Unfortunately, the prevailing methods may be confounded by the
existence of non-linearity and outliers, and give conflicting conclusions. In this paper, we propose a visualizationbased method to improve the mutual fund analysis, where
a new visual analytical tool, the density-based distribution
map, is applied. The new visual representations greatly
help to understand the critical relations, reveal the deficiency of current analytical algorithms, and support mutual
funds selection. The tool is used to perform an expert financial analysis, and establish a fund selection strategy from
a real-world database of the US stock funds. Our method
gains the admiration and support from professionals in the
finance field, they embrace it as a potential investment analysis tool for mutual fund managers, financial planners, and
investors.

1. Introduction
Mutual funds allow a group of investors to pool their
money together and invest. The funds manager invests the
funds’ assets, typically by buying stocks or bonds, or a combination of the two. Mutual funds provide many benefits
to investors. First of all, it is very difficult for an investor
with only $1000 to invest in a diversified basket of market instruments. But any small investor can easily achieve
a diversified portfolio by investing in a diversified mutual
fund(s). Second, unlike the underlying assets that may have
limited liquidity in the market, mutual funds can be very
easily traded. Further, by combining their cash together,
investors in mutual funds have an access to a professional

are distributed into a regular grid according to the values
of a specific characteristic and the annual return (fund performance). Each grid cell corresponds to a pair of the data
ranges of the characteristic and the return values. Thus, the
grid cells store the number of mutual funds whose values
fall into the corresponding ranges, termed as the fund distribution density. The resolution and size of the grid can
be controlled by users according to the visualization context and the analysis requirements. By mapping the density
values to a color spectrum, the regular grid is visualized on
the screen as a density-based distribution map to illustrate
the relation between the particular characteristic and the return of all the funds. To further utilize the screen area in
the plotting domain, reveal the data distribution in the congested areas, and remove large blank regions, we also visualize the density grid as an uneven and weighted distribution
map. For comparison and analysis purposes, we plot the
ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression line - which is typically used by financial researchers to analyze mutual funds
- on the same map.

where y is the dependent variable representing the return
of funds, and X is the explanatory variable, which is the
fund characteristics and the intercepts. β is the vector of
regression coefficients, and is estimated by minimizing the
sum of squares of the residuals (SSR):
SSR(β ) = ∑ (y − X β )2 .

The OLS regression technique ensures that we find the values of β , which fit the sample data in the specific sense of
minimizing the sum of squared residuals. It is clear that
the conclusions drawn from the OLS method with linear
assumptions may be questionable if a complex, non-linear
relation exists between the dependent variable and explanatory variables.

2. Related Work
Visual analytical techniques have been introduced to represent massive, dynamic and complicated data with various
visual elements, thus helping users visually interact with
the information, understand the complexity, and make decisions. A good survey was recently given for the scope
and challenge of this emerging research field [7]. Humancomputer interaction also plays an important role in the research area [13]. An elegant usage of the screen space is
proposed by Keim et al. [9] where HistoScale represents
a distortion map by computing a histogram within a given
number of bins. Jerding et al. [6] use visual attribute to fit
the entire information within a display window or screen.
Financial data analysis is a significant application domain for visual analytic, and several previous projects illustrated great benefits and potentials of using visual tools in
the business world. Theme River [4] is applied on financial
time series data to identify increases or decreases of asset
prices. Time-varying indicator data is analyzed [12] relying
on an unsupervised clustering algorithm combined with an
appropriately designed movement data visualization technique. Keim et al. [8] use Growth Matrix to facilitate
analysis of subinterval return rates among groups of assets.
Ziegler et al. [15] analyze some of the standard statistical
measures for technical financial data analysis and demonstrate the insufficient and the misleading results of the real
performance of one asset. Recently, pixel-based paradigms
are proposed with improved insights for asset analysis to
support the discovery of asset characteristics [16].

1.1. Mutual Funds
We provide a brief description of mutual fund properties
in this section. The characteristics we examine in this paper
are: total asset size, cash holdings, front-end load, rear-end
load, expense ratios, and turnovers.
The total size of a mutual fund is usually called the net
asset value (in million US dollars); it is the current market
value of a fund’s holdings less its liabilities. Cash holding
is the percentage of fund asset in the form of cash. Frontend load is a fee paid when shares are purchased, in the
percentage of fund asset. This fee reduces the amount of
investment. Rear-end load is a fee paid when shares are redeemed, in the percentage of fund asset. Expense ratios are
sometimes called the management fees, in the percentage
of fund asset. Turnover is a measure of the fund’s transactions and is usually calculated over a year’s period and as
a percentage of net asset value. the fund manager trades.
Finally, total return is the percentage change - over a specified period of time - in a mutual fund’s net asset value, with
the ending net asset value adjusted to take into account the
reinvestment of all income dividends and any capital gains
distributions made by the fund.

1.2. Statistical Analysis

3. Density-based Fund Distribution Map

Financial economists usually employ the ordinary-leastsquares (OLS) regression technique to examine the relation
between multiple variables [3]. The standard linear regression model assumes a linear relation between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable:
y = Xβ ,

(2)

3.1. Density Grid Method
We propose a new density-based distribution map by
introducing a density grid to record the number of funds
whose characteristic-and-return values fall into specified

(1)

253

ranges. We divide the 2D plotting domain into a regular grid G, which has the axis of one characteristic C representing the values from C[0] = minimum(C) to C[M −
1] = maximum(C), and the axis of the return R representing the values from R[0] = minimum(R) to R[N − 1] =
maximum(R). This partition is controlled by resolutions M
and N for the two axes, respectively. Thus, for a grid cell
G(i, j) where 0≤i < M and 0≤ j < N, it stores the number
of the funds whose characteristic value c and return value r
satisfy:
C[i]≤c < C[i + 1],
R[ j]≤r < R[ j + 1].

Figure 1. Distribution map with different resolutions.

The resolutions M and N can be adjusted by the visualization context and the analysis requirement, such as the screen
size, the total number of funds, or by user interactions. In
this way, all the mutual funds are distributed into a density
grid as a 2D array. To visualize the grid, each cell is rendered by a quad with

most of the funds have expense ratios in a range between 0.0
to 0.4. However, because a small amount of funds charge
larger expenses, the evenly-distributed map wastes the valuable visualization domain as blank spaces. Even when the
resolution is decreased from Figure 1a to Figure 1b, this
problem persists. To fully utilize the information and resources here, we extend the regular density-based distribution map to a weighted distribution map. This functionality
is mainly intended to add a focus+context capability to further explore the crowded areas of interest [14].
The density grid is generated in the same way as before.
However, when visualizing the grid, the quad width of a
grid cell G(i, j) is modified from W · M1 to

where W and H are the width and height size of the plotting
domain, i.e. the result map. Furthermore, we map the density value into a color spectrum to determine colors of the
quads, where red illustrates large density values and blue reflects small density values, which are shown on top of each
result image.
Essentially, the visual tool is used to improve the understanding of mutual funds performance. However, to argue
the reliability of this tool, and its superiority as mutual funds
analysis tool over OLS, we plot the regression results on the
density-based distribution map as well. This is easy to implement, since the OLS result, of the estimated return value
r and the characteristic value c, can be simply drawn as a
2D line as:
r = (coe f .)c + (int.),

widthi = W ·

,
total number of funds

and the height is modified from H · N1 to
the number of funds in row j
height j = H ·
.
total number of funds

(9)

(10)

In this way, the size of a quad on the map represents
the fund density of a cell, together with the color. This
weighted visualization algorithm utilizes most space of the
plotting area. Meanwhile, the regression fitted line should
also be plotted with these weights, and as a result, the fitted line becomes a curve on the map. This guarantees
that the regression line is always computed from the original data and is not controlled by the user choice. We use
an incremental method for plotting the regression curve.
We draw a line segment between two consecutive vertices
(LastVertex,CurVertex) on the regression curve step by
step. The basic algorithm is:

where the coe f . and int. are the coefficient and intercept,
respectively, from OLS regression computing.
Figure 1 is the distribution maps of plotting return values against expenses values with different resolutions. Figure 1a is the result using M = N = 150 and Figure 1b uses
M = N = 60. The purple lines on the Figure are the OLS
regression result computed from Table 2 as:
estimated return = 0.71 · expenses + 0.139.

deeply explore the main trend of the data. For example,

interest between expenses and return. Further analysis will

It is seen that the funds vary tremendously in size, with the
largest fund commanding over $84 billion in assets, while
the fund at the 25 percentile only has $4.66 million under
management. Asset distribution is significantly skewed, as
the mean asset size ($334.30 million) is more than 10 times
larger than the median asset size ($28.44 million). On average, funds hold 3.06% of their assets in cash to meet the
potential liquidity demand, but about half of the funds have
only about 2.07% in cash. The majority of funds do not
charge front loads, but those that pose front load charge
a quite steep amount with the maximum at 5.75% of total fund asset size. On the other hand, most funds charge
rear loads, with the mean (median) at 1.87% (1%) of the total value of fund assets. Expense ratios vary from a low of
0.12% to a high of 5.01%, with a mean of 1.75% of total asset size. Fund managers also show much difference in their
tendency to trade. The turnover varies from a 25 percentile
of 0.35 to a 75 percentile of 1.1 of the total asset size. On
average, a fund turns over 0.91 of its asset during the year,
which is much larger than the median turnover of 0.66.
Most funds perform quite well in 2006. The mean return
is 15.15% and the median return is 14.49%. 149 of the 5722
funds (2.64%) have negative returns, with the lowest at 13.10%. The best performer in 2006 generates a return at
85%. 59 of the 5722 funds (1.03%) have returns above 40%,
363 funds (6.34%) have returns above 30%, and 1,386 funds
(24.22%) have returns above 20% during 2006.

The regular density-based distribution map and the
weighted map have their different usages. While the later
can provide better space utilization and particular emphasis
on highly weighted cells, the former excels in giving global
distribution insight without distortions.

4. Performance Analysis of Mutual Funds
The analysis shown in this section is conducted by financial experts. First, we describe the data facts. In Section
4.2, the statistical analysis of mutual funds using OLS is
presented. The purpose of this inclusion is to compare the
statistical analysis with the analysis derived from our visual
tools, which is described in Section 4.3. This comparison
will prove the reliability of the visual tool and its capabilities to tackle the deficiencies of OLS.

4.2. OLS Results Analysis
We report in Table 2 the OLS results on the relation between fund performance and fund characteristics. To reduce
the impact of large-sized funds, we use the natural logarithm of fund size, instead of the raw fund size in Table 2.
Asset Size: Column 1 shows that the regression coefficient (Coef.) of log fund size is 0.003. The economic
interpretation is that when fund size increases by $10 million (log fund size increases by 2.30), fund return on av-

method. In total we have 5722 funds in this study. Table

255

erage increases by 0.69% per year, which is computed by
0.0069 = 2.30 × 0.003. Standard error (S.E.) measures the
accuracy of the coefficient estimate, and p-value (p-val) indicates the confidence level we can have on the coefficient
estimate. We can be more than 99% (=1-0.01) confident
that the larger the fund is, the higher the returns are. For
the intercept (Int.), it indicates the average return of a fund
with size $1 million (log fund size = 0), which on average
generates return of 14.1%. R2 measures the goodness of fit,
and it suggests that the OLS can only explain about 0.9% of
total variation in fund returns.
Cash Holdings: Column 2 shows that we can be more
than 99% confident (with p-value less than 1%) that cash
holdings are positively associated with fund performance.
On average, an increase of 100% in cash holding leads to
an increase of 13% in annual fund returns. This magnitude
is economically significant and very counter-intuitive.
Front-end and Rear-end Load: Column 3 shows that
we can be about 97% (=1-0.03) confident that front-end
load significantly increases fund returns - an increase of
front-end load by 100% increases annual fund returns by
11%. Column 4 shows that with 93% confidence rear loads
increase fund performance - an increase by 100% increases
returns by 13%. These findings are consistent with those
from [5] but not consistent with the conventional wisdom in
the investment industry.
Expense Ratios: Column 5 shows that we can be 99%
confident that higher expense ratios enhance fund returns. A
one percentage difference in expense ratio is associated with
a performance difference of 0.71%. This result is consistent
with [2]. However, the regression fit is very poor, i.e., R2 is
close to 0.1%.
Turnover: The last column implies that we can be over
99% confident that higher turnovers will hurt fund performance. An increase of 1.0 in turnover would lead to a drop
of 1% in returns per year. The negative relation between
turnover and fund return is consistent with the Morningstar
study [10] and the conventional wisdom, but different from
[2].

consider our tool a great potential to improve their state-ofthe-art in massive data analysis (usually with linear regression computation).
4.3.1 Return against Asset Size

Figure 3. Return against fund asset size.
Figure 3 plots return against fund size. This map suggests that the majority of funds are small, as there is a concentration of funds on the left edge of the map. Moreover,
the maximal returns are higher among smaller-sized funds
than among larger-sized funds. If one considers the maximum return as the maximum potential rate of return one
can get, this figure supports the conventional wisdom that
as fund size goes up, the highest potential return one can
obtain goes down. In other words, only small funds have
the potential to yield extremely high returns.
So why is the relation between fund return and asset size
statistically positive from the OLS regression analysis? The
map suggests that this relation is driven by the large variation in returns among small funds. Both the maximum and
the minimum returns are from funds with very small asset
size. In particular, there is a concentration of small funds
with returns between 0.07 and 0.18. The variation in returns
becomes smaller for larger-sized funds.

4.3. Visualization-based Analysis
By plotting the fund return against the fund characteristics separately in Figures 3 to 10. The analytical reasoning includes the expert analytic discourse, and the guided
statistical computing from visual insights. It illustrates the
strength and the contribution of our method, emerging from
the close collaborative work of the authors from both computer science and financial economics. As we going along,
we will highlight the benefits of our method over OLS, and
its suitability for analyzing mutual funds. Our visual tool
has achieved a primary support and a good evaluation from
the domain professionals who were consulted during the
different stages of achieving this work. Promisingly, they

is positive, we resort to Figure 5 with weighted distribution
map.
It is clear from Figure 5 that there is a concentration of
funds with zero cash holdings but lower returns (see the
red and yellow quads on the leftmost column of the map),
which pulls the left-side of the line downwards. One explanation behind this finding is that funds with close-to-zero
cash holdings may have more liquidity constraints, so they
often may be forced to sell their assets upon redemption demand even though selling these assets at that point in time
does not generate good returns. Meanwhile, cash deficiency
may prohibit these managers to pursue profit opportunities
in the market.
We slice our sample into two groups based on cash holding and run OLS regressions among the two groups. The
results are presented in Table 4. It is clear that the relation between cash holding and returns is significantly negative among funds with cash holding equal to or greater than
1.5%, and the relation is not statistically significant (with a
large p-val) among funds with cash holding less than 1.5%.
Again, the results from Table 2 is misleading because of the
complexity of the data set. The insight from Figures 4 and
5 is that it is important for funds to have some liquidity in
the form of cash to meet redemption request and have flexibility, but high cash holding hurts fund returns.

Based on our visualization method, we gain an important
conclusion from the above analysis: in revealing the assetand-return relation, one need to re-analyze the whole fund
data sets with respect to the total asset size. We use the asset size $25 million to divide the whole data set, which is
close to and lower than the median total asset size ($28.44
million). We re-run the OLS regressions of returns on total asset size among two sub-groups: those with asset size
below $25 million and above. The results are shown in Table 3. Here, the regression coefficient of log fund size is
basically zero among funds with asset size above or equal
to $25 million. In contrast, the regression coefficient is still
significantly positive among small funds, suggesting the results in Column 1 of Table 2 is mainly driven by small funds
with asset size below $25 million, which is quite misleading. Because of the large negative returns among them,
funds with asset size below $25 million yield an average
return of 14.19%. In contrast, the average return of funds
with asset size above or equal to $25 million is 16%. Thus,
it is clear that there is no reason to prefer a fund with asset
size $50 billion over a fund with asset size with $20 billion.
4.3.2 Return against Cash Holding
Figure 4 is a plot of return against cash holding. This map
shows that there is much variations in cash holdings across
funds, and funds with highest returns tend to have lower
cash holdings. Although the regression results in Table 2
suggest that we should prefer a fund with 15% of asset in
cash to a fund with 3% of asset in cash, this figure suggests
that the up-side potential for a fund with high cash holding
is quite limited. To find out why the regression coefficient

vertical lines because front load is a discrete variable. The
map shows that most funds do not charge front loads. When
funds charge front loads, they tend to be high. This figure
also shows that there is much variations in returns among
funds with zero front-loads. Among load funds, return variation increases with the load charged. The regression line is
rather flat, suggesting that higher load funds barely outperform lower load funds.

4.3.5 Return against Turnover
Figure 9 plots return against fund turnover. This map
suggests a general downward relation between returns and
turnovers, which agrees with the regression output. Even
though there are a few funds with very high returns and relatively low turnovers, these observations do not seem to drive
the negative relation between returns and turnovers. Does
this result mean investors should always invest in funds with
the lowest turnovers?
Note that there is a concentration of funds with turnovers
below 1.0 on the map. Is there any non-linearity among
these funds? We resort to a weighted distribution map reported in Figure 10 to explore this question. Figure 10
shows that there are more funds with turnover between
0.182 and 0.363, and between 0.363 and 0.545 than the adjacent groups, and these funds seem to outperform the adjacent groups as well. Guided by this insight, we break funds
into several groups and report the summary statistics in Table 6.

Figure 7. Return against rear-end load

4.3.4 Return against Expense Ratio
Figure 8 plots return against expense ratio. The colored
quads in this map are evenly-distributed, and a clear relation
between returns and expense ratios does not appear to exist.
In fact, the map suggests that the positive regression coefficient may be driven by the outlier funds with very high returns and with expense ratio at about 1% to 2% (represented
by colored quads at the upper region of the map), since there
is a concentration of funds with returns about 14% and close
to zero expense ratios. To investigate this speculation, we
delete the 18 observations with returns greater than 60%
that year, and find that the regression coefficient among the
remaining 5704 funds is not significantly positive any more
(p-value = 0.25). We reported these results in Table 5.

5. Conclusion
The relation between mutual fund performance and fund
characteristics is of much interest to financial market practitioners and investors. However, there is a lack of conclusive knowledge on this issue. In this study, we use visu-

alization techniques to examine the relation between fund
returns and fund asset size, cash holding, loads, expense ratios, and turnover. Our visual analytic tool uses the densitybased distribution map to plot fund distributions on a colored map, thus providing a clear and an intuitive depiction of many assets on a limited plotting area. Our method
can help economists better understand massive data distribution. It can supplement traditional statistical analysis
and assist in re-designing improved statistical computation,
therefore, provides a solid support for decision making in
mutual fund investment.
