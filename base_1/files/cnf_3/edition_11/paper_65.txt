Abstract

I t is easy t o see t h a t following this idea R(o)are t h e
real numbers, R(l) are t h e complex numbers and
are the quaternions as they are usually described since
Hamilton.
There are some operational tools that are also interesting t o state.
For example it is useful t o embed R2+l 3 R3 on
R(!) identifying ( x 0 , x ) E R2+l with xo . eo x E R"
this elements will be called quaternion vectors. Using
the other notation we can also put:

A s a pure academic exercise, M Mitrea [I] published a paper about Clifford Wavelets, this is the
more ehaustive aproach to thiy subject, years before I
published (Traversoni[3]) a paper completely unrelated
about quaternion wavelets from a different point of
view. I n this paper I try to develop a little more the
idea of Mitrea in terms of a ":;tatic" use of quaternion
wavelets, and also some of my own ideas related to its
"dynamic" use.

1. The static approach
Also we can define a conjugate:
We outline, following the ideas of M. Mitrea, the
definition of quaternion wavelets.

1.1. Basic concepts
and there is also a multiplicative inverse given by

x-1 = w/1x12

First of all quaternions are a skew field and may be
considered in a more general theory those of Clifford
algebras.
The Clifford Algebra associated with R" with the
euclidean metric is the extension of R" t o a unitary
associative algebra R(") over the reals for which
1) x2 = -1512
2)R(")is generated as an algebra by R"
3)R(,) is not generated by any proper subspace of

T h e real part of a E R(2)is noted Rea = a0 of course
[ai2 = R e ( a 3 ) = Re@) T h e 22 dimensional complex
algebra is called C(2).
I t is important t o note that if x is a quaternion
1 exp z 1 = exp ( R e x )
Of course with all the above we can define (provided
that we consider defined the inner and outer products)
for two quaternions a and b the product:

R"

We also have that x y + yx = -2 < x , y > for any
x , y E R" where < ., . > is the usual inner product.
Now if {e3}3n,l is a basis of R" the above is equivalent to: e3ek eke3 = -25,k which implies e; = -1 for
any 1 5 j 5 n and eJek = -eke3 for any 1 5 j # k 5 n.
From here now any element t~ E
will be represented as:
a1 E R
a = CaI.1

1.2. Analytical facts

In all the following we suppose we are in an euclidean
space R2+l = R3 embedded in the quaternions R ( 2 ) .
Let then f and g be two locally bounded quaternion
valued functions defined in a n open domain R C_ R3.

If W 2 V,,) is a left or right submodule of V(,) then
any morphism of quaternion modules L : W +. C(2)is
called a quaternion functional of W . The collection of
all quaternion functionals of W will be called W * .
Let now IH be a complex Hilbert space, 31(2) is a
complex Hilbert space with:

Following Pompeiu[3] is defined the quaternion
derivative of the ordered pair (f,g) a t a point X E R
as:

We also can say that (f,g) is quaternion differntiable
at X if there is an element c E R p ) such that for any
E > 0 there exists an open neighborhood U

so that:

for all prisms Q of R3 with X E Q c U and such
that for some C Vol(Q) 2 C ~ i i a m ( Qn) ~is the outward normal t o the boundary of the rectangle da is
theesurface measure of LJQ and Vol is the Lebesgue
measure in R3. The multiplication on the integrand is
a quaternion multiplication.
Other important statements in the theory are that:

2..Quaternion wavelets
If what we intend is t o construct systems of quaternion valued wavelet-like bases adapted t o a quaternion
valued measure b(x)dx in R" where b : Rm + R3 c
C(z)then we have to note that quaternions are not conmutative and such a system should be in fact a pair of
quaternion valued functions let's call them { O i k } j . k
and { O f k } j , kwhich will .be from now on quaternion

wavelets.

It is important to note that for the above QMRA
of L 2 ( R m ) ( 2 )it can be prooved that there exists a
dual pair of wavelet bases (Of:,,k}e,j,kand {OfJ,k}e,J,k

Here IQ1 is the euclidean volume of the cube.
It is very important to note that unless they vanish
both wavelets take values on the real quaternions R(2)

5 . Moving volume

Normally we have such pulses associated t o a zone,
so we have a collection of pulses given by a set of scalar
wavelet functions w l , 202, ....,w, associated t o a set of
points, given each one by a quaternion 41, q2, ....,qn
whose scalar part represents the colour.
Now the idea is t o associate in a convenient way the
wavelet function t o the quaternion in order t o represent
the movement.
One way may be for example t o represent a dilation,
t o multiply it by the vectorial part of the quaternion
remember each quaternion is of the form:

Movements may be represented as quaternions, in
our case double quaternions:
A 4D rotation of a point x t o a point x is given by:

x = GXR
A quaternion pair G and H is called a Double
Quaternion
Note that:
A unit quaternion represents two plane rotations in
4D space
This rotations are of equal angle 812
The product of two rotations of equal double angle
[GI and [E]cancels the rotations in one of the planes
and doubles the rotations in the other so it becomes a
rotation in 3D with angle B
For a specified level of error 5 and an upper bound
L the radius of the sphere in 4D, R is:

{cos 0/2, x sin 0/2, y sin 012, z sin 0/2)

so we apply the wavelet t o the set (2,y, z )
Then the movement of the whole body is obtained
via interpolation (for example B spline interpolation)
doing t o each component of the quaternions:
n+l

I

vx E [O,n], a(.)
Y-1

A traslation in 3D , be d to be represented in 4D
should be approximated by a rotation of angle 9 such
that the limit s i n 9 -+ 9 beeing Q = d / R .

The double quaternion that represents such rotation

where U is the unit vector in the direction of the traslation
The displacement may be represented by the double
quaternion (D,E)
The rotation may be represented by the double
quaternion (Q, Q) and as we have the associative and
distributive property a combined movement of rotation
and traslation in 3D is given by a double quaternion
G' formed by two unit quaternions G and H such that:

Finally we obtain a cr interpolant for each coordinate
and for the real part (note that they are not independent) in such a way that the quaternionic function representing each movement will be:

G=DQ H = E Q

q(t) =

Now we have our solid object and its interior parts
defined in terms of quaternion wavelets where the
colour is represented via the scalar part of the quaternion.
Appliying a quaternion we can move the whole as
a rigid solid, moreover we can move each of its parts
asigning a quaternion of movement to each one.
The movement, if it is done by pulses for example
(like in a beating heart) can be expressed as a function
of time and approximated in terms of wavelets, in this
case we can animate our object by parts and also in
terms of wavelets.

{cos a,t, sin aWtal(t),
sin a,ta,(t), sin a,ta,(t)}

However we can do more, forgetting for example the
real part representing colour, putting it to zero, it will
then represent only the spatial corrdinate of each point
We can apply then to such points, movements represented by quaternions, for example to represent a wave
moving through a solid object of different components.
Such difference of components may be represented by
a wavelet that acts as a filter to the movement.
Now each zone has as weight the wavelet that filters
the wave or the impulse depending upon the material
it represents.

Note that such splines are monogenic functions,
monogenic functions are the generalization of harmonic
functions so sp are monogenic: polynomials.
We are going t o interpolate rotations in the space,
to do that we are going to ta.ke the value of the rotation (the quaternion that represents it) and interpolate
it using a bilinear interpolation the result of which is a
"surface of rotations", each point of which has a diferent quaternion representing the interpolated value of
the quaternion belonging t o it:
Such surface will be given by a two parameter rational Bezier motion

Here the weights w , , ~that in previous works (Ge, Kang,
Sirchia[8]) are taken as real numbers, in our case are

In this way we have a plane which is tangent in a
generic curve to a "surface" which represents not only
a position in space but also a n "action" a rotation in
each point of it.
