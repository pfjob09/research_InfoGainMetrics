Abstract
In this paper, we propose an approach based on
the RBF neural networks and the genetic algorithms
for Magnetic Resonance (MR) brain images segmentation. In the feature extraction stage, nine features
are calculated and used as RBF network inputs. The
genetic algorithm build automatically a RBF NN (It
determines the number of hidden neurons, and their
respective centers and radii). Nets’ fitness is calculated by using the mean square error.

Key words: Segmentation, Medical imagery, Regions, RBF, Genetic algorithm.

1. Introduction
The objective of the scene analysis in computer
vision is to develop a symbolic and semantic representation of the information contained at the rough
state in a digital representation with two or three dimensions for recognition and interpretation.
One of the fundamental processes in the visual
recognition chain is the images segmentation. This
process makes it possible to generate a compact description of the image (contours, regions…) and thus
symbolic more exploitable than the whole of the pixels, an image being a representation of a universe
made up of entities: objects, cells, etc.
The major object of any segmentation method is
the extraction of visual indices known as "attributes"
characterizing the objects of an image. These attributes correspond to points of interest or zones characteristic of the image: the gray levels of the pixels,
the texture notions, the color, the movement, the
connexity notions, the geometrical parameters (surface, parameter...).
The segmentation being the basic element of any
vision system, many works were consecrate to it.
and discusses the present and possible future role
of neural networks. Among these applications, one
finds sixty applications of segmentation, and SOM
maps are the most used architectures.
In this paper, we use the Radial Basis Function

The diversity of the images, the difficulty of the
problem, the varied origins of the researchers, evolution of the computers power, and a certain empiricism in the results evaluation led to a multitude of
algorithms. [1][2][3]
The segmentation applies to types very different
of images and the techniques vary according to the
studied field. For that, there is no general solution to
the problem, but rather a whole of mathematical and
algorithmic tools which we can combine together to
solve a specific problems. A multitude of segmentation techniques is presented in the literature where
the majority of these techniques are based on one of
the fundamental properties of the gray levels: the
discontinuity and the similarity.
We can classify the various segmentation techniques in three classes [1] [2] [4].
The thresholding or Clustering according to one
or more characteristics. The edge detection is based
on the estimation of local discontinuities of the gray
levels function. In a digital image, contours situated
between the pixels belonging to regions having
different average intensities.
The extraction of regions require the determination of the homogeneous zones (having statistically
similar properties) of the image. Contrary to the
techniques of extraction of edge detection, the segmentation in homogeneous regions is based on the
intrinsic properties of the regions. The choice of
these properties determines the criterion of segmentation
In addition, several works were proposed based
on neural networks for segmentation of the satellite,
medical and different images. A recent article [5]
reviews more than 200 applications of neural networks
in
image
processing
neural networks and the genetic algorithms to segment magnetic resonance images. RBFN are twolayer, feed-forward networks which have as origin
the method RBF whose principle is to approximate a
behavior desired by a collection of the functions.

Each function is described by two parameters: the
location Ci and width Vi of its center [6] [7] [8].
The genetic algorithms (GA) are algorithms obtained by direct transpositions of the natural evolution process in the world of data processing [9][10].
There are several aspects which intervene in the
use of the genetic algorithms for the development of
artificial neural networks [11] and [12] reviews some
combinations between ANN’s and genetic algorithms
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.
Section II.1 details the feature extraction process.
Sections II.2 and II.3 discusses respectively RBF
NNs and genetic algorithms used in our approach.
The labeling step is presented in Section II.4. Segmentation results are reported in Section III and we
finish by a brief conclusion.

Our approach is based on three stages (see fig. 1):
feature extraction stage, the RBF NN used and parameters of the genetic algorithm used in the training
to obtain best RBF NN.
A set of nine attributes defines to extract the characteristics from the images used. We used here the
results of Heather Erin Rickard [13]. He defines a
new algorithm to select the best subset of characteristics (from a set of 23 characteristics) for the medical images segmentation.
The corpus of images is divided into three sets:
one for the training process, another for validation,
and the last to test the generalization power of the
best RBF NN found. The training set is used by the
learning algorithm to compute the weights of the
new NN; the validation set is used to compute the
fitness of individuals.
Then, the population of genetic algorithm is initialized from the training images set, and each
chromosome of this population represents a RBF
NN. For each network (chromosome), the input
weights are computed by using the training images.
To select the best individuals, one calculates the
fitness of each chromosome by using the evaluation
images. Then, the other genetic operations are applied. After a number of generations (criterion of
stop), the optimal network is coded in the best chromosome of the genetic algorithm; It is used to edge
detection of images.

The extraction of the characteristics is realized by
measuring certain properties, or features, that distinguish one input pattern from another [14]. The pixels of the gray level image are transformed to a feature vector, and the nine features used here will be
derived from first order gray level parameters, textural measures, and moment invariant features. Once
the features have been obtained for the entire image,
they are ordered into a matrix, where each row
represents all the features for a single pixel, and each
column represents a particular feature for all the pixels in the image.
First order features describe the gray level of a
single pixel or the gray level distribution in a 2D
window, W, of size w x w, centered around the
pixel. In this category, two features were used:
1. The gray level g = I(x,y)

Textural features are acquired using a statistical
method based on the use of sum and difference histograms, developed by Unser [15]. For a given distance d and a given direction T, the sum histogram is
simply the histogram of the sums of all pixels dx and
dy.
Four features were calculated from these histograms:

The measures introduced by Hu [16] make it possible to define the two moment invariants F1 and F2.
These measures are defined by the following formulas:

The genetic algorithm that we propose optimizes
the number of Gaussian functions (neurons of the
hidden layer), their centers and their widths. In this
work, each individual represents a RBF NN and the
values of the centers and those of the widths are
stored in chromosome genes (a real vector to represent a center and a real value to represent a width).
The chromosome is defined by:

So,

Inputs

In our approach, RBF neural network is composed of three layers (see fig. 3). The input layers,
the hidden layer and the output layer. Nine inputs
are used to represent the nine attributes described in
the section II.1. The resulting four outputs of the network are the segmented tissue classes, namely the
CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), cortex (gray matter),
white matter, and background.
The number of the hidden layer neurons, the centers of their Gaussian functions and their widths are
optimized by the genetic algorithm used. Once the
centers number, theirs positions and the widths of
Gaussian fixed, the output weights can be calculated

ron i
Vi its width
k < threshold
This last condition makes it possible to have
chromosomes with different sizes and thus different
hidden neurons of RBF NN.
The chromosomes centers (genes) of the initial
population are selected randomly from the training
corpus, and the widths are initialized by real values
witch are choose randomly in the interval

centers.
The crossover operator provided a mechanism for
mixer selected chromosomes. It is applied to two
RBF NNs; it takes a random uniformly chosen number of consecutive hidden neurons from first network, and another sequence from the second, and
interchanges the two sequences, no matter if both
sequences have different number of neurons.
Four types of mutation are used: centers mutation,
radii mutation, hidden neuron adder and hidden neuron deleter.
Hidden neuron adder :
This operator duplicates every hidden neuron
with a given probability (the same for all the neuron). One duplicated, the center and width values of
the new neuron are modified using a Gaussian function.
Hidden neuron deleter:
One erases a given percentage of neurons in every
net. Neurons are randomly chosen.
Centers mutation:
This operator changes a given percentage of the
components of the center of every hidden neuron.
Each component of the center is modifier by adding
or subtracting a random value, with mean 0 and
standard 0.1.
ci = ci + Gc
Width Gaussian function mutation:
This operator is applied to one of the existing
nets, but affects to the radii of the RBF. Radii are
modified using a Gaussian function as defined previously. Radii are different for each center, and for
each component of the center.
Vi = Vi + GV
A stage which is preliminary to the crossover and
the mutation operators is the selection process of the
parents (see fig.1). The method used here to select
the best is the Roulette wheel with the integration of
the best chromosome directly in the new population
(Elitism).
Fitness:

evaluation are manually segmented. Figure 3 shows

The performance of each RBF NN is expressed
by a scalar (the fitness). The fitness makes it possible

were yi is the estimated outputs,
O(xi) is the output calculated by the net, and n is
the number of input-output pairs in the validation
set.

2.4 Labeling and edge detection
In this last stage, the best chromosome (RBF NN)
generated by the genetic algorithm is used to detect
edge of the third group images.
For each pixel of image, the corresponding characteristics vector is built and introduced to the input
layer of the optimal network. The output is calculated by using the formula (1), and the class of this
pixel (and the corresponding label) is determinate by
its estimate output.

3. Experiments and results
We used brain MR images (256 gray levels )
an example of image used in this study.
The practical results show that the use of a per-

centage (| 10%) of the training data is sufficient to
obtain the same results in a reduced execution time.
To test the effects of the GA parameters on the
results obtained, we launched three experiments of
our algorithm and the threshold K is fixed at 32 (K: a
maximum centers number of RBF NN, See section
II.3). A summary on the various parameters used is
given in table 2.
The execution time of the genetic algorithm is
proportional with all the parameters and in particular
the size of population and the generations’ number.
The results obtained by three optimal RBF NN of
these algorithms are presented in figures 4, 5, 6 and
7. We can note that the results obtained by the GA1
and the GA2 are better than those of the GA3. This
is due to the number of training and evaluation images.

In this paper, the genetic algorithms and RBF nets
are used for medical images segmentation. The genetic algorithm makes it possible to position the centers of the RBF and to determine their number and
their widths.
The first results demonstrate the use of RBFNNGA as a promising method.
We applied this approach to brain MRI, but it can
be generalized with other types of medical images.
