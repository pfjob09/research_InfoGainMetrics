Abstract
Comparing different Information Visualization (InfoVis)
techniques is a challenging task and a necessary step to
reach the users and their tasks. We evaluated the effectiveness in visualizing psychotherapeutic data of two InfoVis
techniques, namely the Stardinates and the Parallel Coordinates by a comparative study with 22 participants. Based
on three research questions we interpret the results of our
study in order to derive statements on both visualization
techniques. We evaluated (1) the time participants were engaged in testing our material, (2) the number of correct answers, (3) subjects’ statements, which were categorized by
the type of statement, and (4) the subjects’ key statements
in comparison to those deﬁned by an expert. Our empirical
results indicate that the Stardinates are a more appropriate
method for interpreting such highly structured data in detail
whereas Parallel Coordinates show advantages for gaining
information at the ﬁrst glance.

1. Introduction
Information Visualization (InfoVis) is the use of
computer-supported interactive visual representations of
heterogeneous data and information to facilitate cognition [2]. In the last couple of years, a considerable number
of techniques were developed to support that process. By
comparative evaluation we can prove the applicability of InfoVis techniques. In this paper we discuss the evaluation of
two InfoVis techniques, namely the Stardinates [5, 6] and
the Parallel Coordinates [4, 3]. In particular, we are interested in the effectiveness in visualizing psychotherapeutic
data. Domain experts stated both visualization techniques
to be convenient for this kind of data derived from a clinical

study on anorectic girls. The Stardinates are a hybrid InfoVis technique developed recently combining geometricand glyph-based features. The data of one patient is represented by a line with its vertices on the axes arranged in
a circle (compare Figure 2). Each Stardinate can represent
the data of one patient so the data is decomposed into small
multiples. The Parallel Coordinates are a well-known InfoVis technique capable of displaying high dimensional and
complex data. By uniting the data of all patients in one visualization the user is encouraged to compare the patients’
values of single parameters. The goal of our evaluation is
to compare the applicability of Parallel Coordinates and the
Stardinates. Based on our research questions we interpret
the results of our study in order to derive statements on both
visualization techniques.
Our user study, which can be categorized as concept testing, was conducted with 22 participants. The tests were carried out by the use of a software tool we implemented for
that purpose. We mainly collected qualitative data which we
evaluate by categorization. Based on our research questions
we analyze our data by quantifying the qualitative data [8].
Concept testing differs form usability testing insofar as it
allows for focusing on the concept of the visualization itself.
Thus, we reduced the need for extensive preparation of the
participants and narrowed the complexity of user interaction processes by restricting interaction to a bare minimum.
Namely highlighting data lines was implemented in order
to view details, such as date or patient ID. Total elimination of interaction, e.g., by presenting series of views to the
user, would have been counterproductive because both visualization techniques are not developed for the purpose of
presentation but for exploration and analysis. So, controlled
restriction of interaction aspects seemed to be appropriate in
order to cope with the characteristics of an explorative visualization technique on the one hand, and receiving informative feedback from the subjects on the other hand. However,
when it comes to usability testing of a tool, the full range of
interaction needs to be integrated and the tools should be
matched with users, tasks and real problems evaluated over

test. For our study which is a comparison of the Stardinates
and the Parallel Coordinates only the results of these 22 subjects were used. The large time lag between the ﬁrst and the
second test made sure that subjects did not remember the
results from the ﬁrst test when they made the second test.
Results from the second test indicate that no learning effect
took place, and subjects informally told us that taking part
in the ﬁrst evaluation did not inﬂuence their performance in
the second evaluation. We assume, therefore, that the results from the ﬁrst and the second evaluation can reliably be
compared. We decided that this approach was more advantageous than using two parallel samples because in this way
we can make sure that there are no intervening variables inﬂuencing our results (as, for example, previous computer
experience or knowledge about graphical representation of
data).

a long time [7].
We started our study by designing two concrete
visualizations—the ﬁrst using a simple, common data set,
the second is based on psychotherapeutic data derived from
a clinical study. Thereafter, we formulated our research
questions for the study and prepared the testing procedure.
In order to improve the testing procedure and check its practical suitability we adopted pretesting. The goal of pretesting was to get ﬁrst feedback on the visualization techniques
and the practicability of our testing procedure. Five people
participated in these pretests. Based on the ﬁndings of the
pretesting we ﬁnalized the software, the testing procedure,
and the information material for the subjects. This paper
discusses the results of our main study with 22 subjects.
In the following section we deﬁne our research questions.
Thereafter, the participants and the setting of our user study
are described. Our evaluation methods are explained in Section 5. In Section 6 we list the results of our study followed
by our conclusions.

• Are the users able to ﬁnd the crucial information?
• Which visualization supports the creation of
hypotheses?—characteristic for exploratory information visualization [9].
In the following we describe the participants and the
setting of the study in more detail.

4. Setting
3. Participants

Results of related work [1] on test data sets were not sufﬁcient in our context because our application domain (psychotherapy) show speciﬁc criteria not covered by existing
approaches. In order to test the relevant aspects of the Stardinates and the Parallel Coordinates we developed two examples based on image maps integrated in HTML1 code.
Simple PHP2 forms were used to present the questionnaires
to the subjects. Combined with automatic time measurements the results are stored in a MySQL3 database. We observed the time each subject (1) views the ﬁrst example, (2)
answers the corresponding questions, (3) views the second
example, and (4) again answers the related questions.

The sample we used for our investigation is not homogeneous. The subjects we found are diverse in backgrounds,
professions, ages, and gender. Although InfoVis techniques
are often developed for a speciﬁc user group, we think that
concept testing should be characterized by a broader approach. This helps us to test the properties and features
more generally.
The evaluation of the Stardinates took place ten month
before the evaluation of the Parallel Coordinates. 30 persons tested the Stardinates and 31 the Parallel Coordinates,
22 of these persons took part in both evaluations. Since
subjects did not expect to participate in two tests, some participants of the ﬁrst test were not available for our second

opens an additional window containing the questionnaire.
While answering the questions she or he can switch to the
example again and examine it in more detail. It was not our
goal to test whether the subject remembers the visualization.
Therefore, we decided to allow for viewing the example and
answering the questions synchronously. This affects time
measurements and so their interpretation becomes harder.
But it makes the tests more realistic.
The questions related to the ﬁrst example of both InfoVis
techniques are:

The questionnaire is in German. Before the test started
each subject was provided with a detailed information ﬂyer
explaining the procedure, the examples, and the questions.
The tests took place in our InfoVis lab, a maximum of ﬁve
participants tested synchronously.
The testing procedure consisted of the following stages:
First, the starting screen asked for general information
on the subject, such as profession, age, and gender. After
clicking the start button the subject got the ﬁrst example
and time measurement started.
This example showed position data of airplanes based on
the x-, y-, and z-coordinates at different times. The subjects
were asked whether a collision of aircraft has occurred. To
understand this example the subjects need common knowledge of geometry. This ﬁrst example gives an overall idea
of how the visualization looks like. The Stardinates consist of just three axes and three data lines, each of the four
Stardinates shows spatial data of three aircraft at four different times. Parallel Coordinates consist of four axes: the
time point on the left hand side, then x-, y-, and z-axes. Although this kind of spatial data are not best suited, since
they are very simple and other visualization methods are
more appropriate, we chose it as an introduction to the participants because tests of other geometric techniques used
the same approach. Particularly, similar data were used for
tests of the Parallel Coordinates [4].
Interaction was limited to selection purposes: by moving
the mouse cursor over a data line this line is highlighted and
the number of the aircraft is shown.
By clicking the button ’Answer Questions’ the subject

• Did a collision occur? If yes, which aircraft were involved?
• Which visualization(s) / properties of the visualization
helped you to examine the data? What information did
you get there?
• Which problems / challenges occurred while interpreting the visualizations?
So, there is just one correct solution for the ﬁrst question. The second and the third questions give additional information and help us to understand the answer to the ﬁrst
question.
The second example deals with totally different data. It
visualizes (partly ﬁctitious) psychotherapeutic data of ﬁve
patients at three different times derived from a study on
anorectic girls mainly based on questionnaires. Such data
is characterized by a high number of dimensions (e.g., up
to 1500 per patient). In Parallel Coordinates (compare Figure 1) all data is shown within one visualization, whereas

each Stardinate (compare Figure 2) depicts the data of one
patient based on 10 parameters. The labels of the parameters are abbreviations the subjects were unfamiliar with.
Moreover, participants had no experience with this kind of
data. Subjects were asked to interpret the data by searching for eye-catching similarities or varieties among the patients or signiﬁcant changes over time. They were provided
with information material explaining these acronyms, e.g.,
’EAT13’ means that the ’Patient does not feel sick after eating’.
The questions related to the second example are:

These content-speciﬁc questions are followed by two
more general items. In particular, the subject is asked to
describe the ﬁrst impression of the visualization and convey
some feedback about the testing procedure.

5. Method
We used different methods to analyze our data. (1) We
analyzed the time participants were engaged in testing our
material, (2) the number of correct answers to whether a
collision of aircraft happened, (3) the results of the second
example are categorized by the type of statement, and (4)
whether subjects formulated key statements similar to those

• Which visualization(s) / properties of the visualization
helped you to examine the data? What information did
you get there?

deﬁned by an expert who analyzed the psychotherapeutic
data beforehand. For the comparison between the Stardinates and Parallel Coordinates we computed statistical tests
to ﬁnd out whether there was any signiﬁcant difference between these two approaches. We assumed that both Stardinates and Parallel Coordinates are useful for interpreting
highly structured data but that both methods would have signiﬁcant strengths and weaknesses in the context of visualizing psychotherapeutic data. We thought that the Stardinates
would be more valuable for a holistic interpretation of data
whereas Parallel Coordinates would be better for the interpretation of single axes. This should lead to signiﬁcant differences in the number of statements of subjects related to
these areas.
For the qualitative analysis we identiﬁed the subjects by
S1 to S22. Since we translated subjects’ statements from
their native language, they do not match literally with their
answers, but we tried to illustrate the meaning of the statements.
In the evaluation of the ﬁrst example we counted how
many subjects were able to correctly solve the question
whether a collision occurred or not. The analysis of the results of the second example is quite different from the ﬁrst
one because there is not one correct solution. We are interested in the question whether participants were able to
ﬁnd characteristic similarities or differences within the data
and get information on the states of the patients. Therefore,
we applied two evaluation procedures which are described
beneath.

5.2. Key statements

5.1. Categorization of statements

Patient 2: unstable.

None: this category refers to subjects who did not make
any relevant statement.
These categories represent the way the visualization
techniques were used to search for information. In particular, we count whether a subject adopted a certain category
or not.

Another approach is deﬁning key statements from an expert’s point of view. This was done in cooperation with
a psychologist. In particular, we collected ﬁve patientspeciﬁc statements (one for each patient) and one statement
about the whole group of patients, together representing the
most signiﬁcant information found within these data. These
key statements outline the information an expert would conclude from these data. So, we use these statements in order
to evaluate whether the subjects were able to ﬁnd crucial
insights.
Group: All patients do not feel sick after eating.
Patient 1: good starting basis.

Patient 3: contradicting answers.

We deﬁned groups of statements. These categories of
statements enable us to interpret which properties of the visualizations are primarily used by the subjects in order to
ﬁnd information about the patients. We developed these
categories because they allow for a clear and comprehensive classiﬁcation of our material. In particular, we checked
whether a participant made a statement associated with a
certain category or not.

Patient 4: positive progress in therapy and she cares more
about herself.
Patient 5: signiﬁcantly positive progress in therapy between second and third time point.

6. Results

Comparing patients: such as, patient A is similar to patient B.

First, we analyzed whether there are any signiﬁcant differences in the amount of time subjects needed to study
the examples and answer the questions in the tests. Subjects were supposed to work between 30 and 45 minutes
but there was a certain ﬂexibility in this. We compared
the overall time it took subjects to complete both examples.
There was no signiﬁcant statistical difference in this variable between the Stardinates condition and the Parallel Coordinates condition (t = −0.947, df = 21). Then we compared the time subjects needed to ﬁnish the ﬁrst example
and the second example. The ﬁrst and the second example
are slightly different, so the assumption might be plausible

Overview: for instance, Patient A seems to be in good condition.
Changes over time: as condition of patient A is rather stable.
Examining single axes: for instance, EAT9 is rather high.
General conclusions: such as, patients with loss in weight
and appetite tend to ignore their own well-being.

that one method was more advantageous for one example
and the other method for the other example. There were no
statistical differences concerning the time subjects needed
to ﬁnish the ﬁrst (t = 0.862, df = 21) or the second example (t = −1.615).
The average duration of the testing procedure was 37:36
minutes for the Stardinates and 33:31 minutes for the Parallel Coordinates. Table 2 shows the details of the test duration. In particular, average time, minimum time, and maximum time is listed for both examples and for the testing
procedure in total. We see how long the participants were
engaged with (1) viewing the ﬁrst example, (2) answering
the ﬁrst questionnaire, (3) viewing the second example, and
(4) answering the second questionnaire for both visualization techniques. During the answering process the users had
the possibility to do further investigation of the visualization.

Parallel Coordinates: According to subjects’ selfassessment 90.9% of the participants (20 subjects)
were able to get information at the ﬁrst glance.
This number of subjects ﬁnding new information on
patients’ states remained unchanged after becoming a
little more familiar with the data and the visualization.
Typical ﬁndings reported by the subjects using the Stardinates are the following:
S3: Patient 4: Pronounced awareness concerning nutrition,
controls calories. Tendency to restrain appetite. Patients would like to treat themselves to something without realizing these wishes. Patient 3: Loss of weight
and appetite. Avoids to eat when hungry. Controls
calories. Patient 5: Condition improves clearly. Loss
of weight and appetite decreases. Patients 1 and 2 are
in good condition.

6.1. Results of example 1
Stardinates: The question if a collision occurred was answered correctly by 16 participants. So, 72.7% solved
the ﬁrst example successfully. 22.7% (5 subjects) gave
an incorrect answer and 4.5% (1 subject) could not ﬁnd
any solution. Statements of those subjects who answered the ﬁrst question correctly show that most of
them responded to congruity of areas.

S14: Data of patients 2 and 4 indicates similarity. Patients
1, 2, and 4 quite stable, patients 3 and 5 signiﬁcant
variances.
Subjects using the Parallel Coordinates mentioned the
following statements:

Parallel Coordinates: 14 participants (63.6%) recognized
the correct solution, whereas 5 subjects (22.7%) gave
the wrong answer, and 3 subjects (13.6%) could not
answer the question.

S10: None of the patients feels sick after eating. There are
signiﬁcant changes in EAT5 and EAT9.

progress) (χ2 = 5.4, df = 1, level of signiﬁcance: 5%).
They did not produce signiﬁcantly more statements concerning any patient in the Parallel Coordinates condition.

6.3. Results of example 2 by categorization of statements

7. Conclusions

In general, subjects produced signiﬁcantly more statements in the deﬁned categories (Comparing patients,
Overview, etc.) when they worked with the Stardinates than
when they worked with Parallel Coordinates (t = 3.504,
df = 21, level of signiﬁcance: 5%). The mean number of
statements in the deﬁned categories was 3.27 in the Stardinates condition and 2.14 in the Parallel Coordinates condition.
There are two categories which contribute to this result.
Subjects produced signiﬁcantly more statements concerning the category ’Overview’ in the Stardinates condition
(χ2 = 5, df = 1, level of signiﬁcance: 5%) and concerning the category ’Causal dependencies’ (χ2 = 5.44, df = 1,
level of signiﬁcance: 5%). Contrary to our expectation, they
did not produce signiﬁcantly more statements concerning
any category in the Parallel Coordinates condition.
Table 3 shows the frequency scale of the various types of
statements. We checked for each subject whether this kind
of statement was made or not, e.g. Table 4 shows who made
which type of statement using the Stardinates.

Finally, we answer the three research questions and interpret the results.

7.1. Are the users able to ﬁnd information at the
ﬁrst glance?
90.9% of the participants testing the Parallel Coordinates
and 63.6% of the participants testing the Stardinates stated
that they were able to get information at the ﬁrst glance. Obviously, this is just an individual impression of the participants but in combination with our other research questions it
is an interesting factor. The outstanding difference between
the two visualization techniques might be inﬂuenced by the
degree of familiarity with the Parallel Coordinates. Nobody
was familiar with the Stardinates but 36.4% of the subjects
knew the Parallel Coordinates. However, glyph-based visualizations are often confusing at the ﬁrst glance because it
is not obvious which item deserves immediate attention. It
seems that the user needs to decide where to start in contrast
to more intuitive focusing when confronted with just one visualization. Thus, the Parallel Coordinates are beneﬁcial in
this context.

6.4. Results of example 2 evaluated by key statements
Table 5 shows how many subjects found information corresponding to our key statements. 72.72% of the subjects
using the Parallel Coordinates and 54.55% using the Stardinates found out that patients do not feel sick after eating. 68.18% of the subjects using the Stardinates but only
22.73% of those using the Parallel Coordinates reported
about the good starting basis of patient 1. Also noticeable
is the high number of subjects (54.55%) who recognized
the signiﬁcant progress of patient 5 and the group statement
using the Stardinates.
In general, subjects produced signiﬁcantly more key
statements (as deﬁned by an expert) when they worked with
the Stardinates than when they worked with the Parallel Coordinates (t = 2.687, df = 21, level of signiﬁcance: 5%).
The mean number of key statements was 2.32 in the Stardinates condition and 1.32 in the Parallel Coordinates condition.
There are two categories which contribute to this result.
Subjects produced signiﬁcantly more often a key statement
concerning the ﬁrst patient (good starting basis) in the Stardinates condition (χ2 = 5, df = 1, level of signiﬁcance:
5%) and concerning the ﬁfth patient (outstanding positive

7.2. Are the users able to ﬁnd the crucial information?
Although the participants were unfamiliar with psychotherapeutic data, they were able to ﬁnd crucial insights.
According to our statistical analysis the Stardinates are signiﬁcantly better for ﬁnding crucial information represented
by the key statements deﬁned by an expert. One reason
might be that the Stardinates direct users’ attention to differences and similarities. Decomposing the data into appropriate chunks of information (typical for glyphs) but keeping
a grid of reference at the same time (typical for geometric
visualizations) seems promising. The visualizations of the
data of patient 1 on the one hand and patient 5 on the other
hand are obviously different. Participants were motivated to
report this difference. Also the similarity of one parameter,
in particular, EAT13, was informative to the participants.
Although Parallel Coordinates showed a high result in the
group-category, which is based on one dimension (EAT13)
only, Parallel Coordinates are not signiﬁcantly better in this
category.

7.3. Which visualization supports the creation of
hypotheses?

7.4. An interpretation of the results
Our empirical results indicate that the Stardinates are a
more appropriate method for interpreting such highly structured data in detail. Subjects produced more statements in
the predeﬁned relevant categories (compare Table 3) of interpretation and they produced more statements similar to
the key statements (compare Table 5) given by an expert.
It seems that the Stardinates are a method which motivates
users to process the information presented by the visualization more deeply than the Parallel Coordinates and to create
a more detailed interpretation. Parallel Coordinates over the
Stardinates enabled the users to ﬁnd information on the ﬁrst
glance. A combination of an overview visualization on the
one hand and small multiples on the other hand could be

This criteria is an essential aspect of exploratory information visualization [9] and is therefore considered in our
evaluation. In general, subjects produced signiﬁcantly more
statements in the deﬁned categories (Comparing patients,
Overview, etc.) when they worked with the Stardinates than
when they worked with the Parallel Coordinates. Moreover, they did not need signiﬁcantly more time when using
the Stardinates. So, the Stardinates seem more motivating
for ﬁnding hypotheses in the context of our study although
subjects reported more information at the ﬁrst glance when
using Parallel Coordinates. So, Stardinates seem less informative at the ﬁrst glance according to participants selfassessment but yielded more information because subjects
created signiﬁcantly more hypotheses.

a promising approach. There is some indication that Stardinates especially support holistic forms of interpretation
and interpretation of temporal developments. Nevertheless,
it is necessary to check whether these results hold under
modiﬁed conditions. We tested, for example, the Stardinates using the data of ﬁve patients but it seems plausible
to assume that only a limited number of Stardinates can be
processed simultaneously. Therefore, more research in that
area is necessary.
