Abstract
Navigation is playing an increasingly important
role in virtual environments (VE). Today virtual worlds
are very large and present challenging navigation
tasks. Usually a VE contains few visual details and
hence few landmarks to support navigation. In this
paper we propose a technique to automatic identify
landmarks in large virtual environment using spatial
data mining techniques. Identified landmarks are used
to enrich landmark knowledge which is essential for
navigation in VE. Initially three datasets with different
number of objects have been generated based on a
realistic distribution of buildings on one of newest and
well designed Egyptian cities. A new model for
extracting landmarks in VE was developed based on
the models used in real environment. The proposed
technique was applied on the generated cities and
successfully identified the landmarks.

1. Introduction
Large virtual environments (VE) are the
environments where navigator viewpoint does not
encompass the environment in its totality [1].
Recently, Virtual models for large cities have
become increasingly popular. Often these models are
used for many VE applications such as training and
urban planning. Navigation is an essential task for any
VE applications [2]. Users of large VE have difficulties
maintaining knowledge of their location and
orientation while moving throughout the virtual
environment. Way finding techniques are used to
overcome this problem [3] [4] [5][6]. Way finding is
the cognitive component of navigation. It is a decision
making process as a user makes decisions by
processing the information obtained from the
environment. Landmarks are one of the essential
components of any way finding procedure. It helps the
user to navigate by recalling the sequence of his
previous actions.
Motivated by the growing number of large virtual
environments and the difficulty of way finding in such

environments [1][7], we proposed a technique for
automatic identification of landmarks in large scale
virtual environments using a spatial data mining
techniques. The extracted landmarks are used to enrich
basic landmark knowledge and for developing further
procedure and survey knowledge, which are essential
for way finding tasks.
The main contribution of this paper is the model for
defining attractiveness of landmarks in virtual
environments. This model is based on similar models
previously used in real environment way finding taking
into consideration differences between real and virtual
environments. We used a spatial data mining technique
to automatic identify landmarks and applied the
proposed technique on three virtual cities with realistic
building distribution.

1.1. Spatial Knowledge
The main goal of any way finding system is to
allow the user to acquire spatial knowledge and build
an effective cognitive map. Thorndyke[8] identified
three types of spatial knowledge that users may acquire
from the environment: Landmark knowledge,
procedural knowledge and survey knowledge.
Landmark knowledge consists of information about
the visual details of a specific object in the
environment. This information is visually prominent
and can be acquired directly. Landmark knowledge is a
fundamental component of the other two kinds of
spatial knowledge.
Procedural knowledge expresses the sequence of
actions required to follow a definite path traverse. At
least, it must consists of a sequence of records
including starting point, anchor points, subsequent
landmarks, intermediate stopping points and a final
destination [9]. Procedural knowledge, which is
considered to be at a higher cognitive level, is
characterized by the awareness of how to move from
one place to another and is also called routing
knowledge.
Survey knowledge refers to the spatial relationships
among places and knowledge of geographical patterns.

This type of knowledge represents the configuration
relations among locations and routes in an
environment.

1.2. Landmarks
Landmarks are objects with distinct environmental
features that function as reference points. Landmarks
are essential in navigating an environment whether it
was real [10][11] or virtual [3][4]. Landmarks help
organizing the environment, and when associated with
navigational actions like turning right (left) they ease
navigation by recalling when and where these actions
should be taken.
Landmarks are the subject of landmark knowledge.
They help users to get their initial orientation in virtual
environments, and support subsequent development of
procedure and survey knowledge. Lack of landmarks
causes travelers in virtual environment to easily
become disoriented and unable to search for
destinations or construct an accurate cognitive map [7].
In visual navigation local and global landmarks are
used in way finding decisions [4]. Global landmarks
are visible from large area like towers; they define a
global reference frame that does not change when
moving a small distance. In contrast, local landmarks
are visible only from a small distance.
Several studies have been done on the definition
and usage of landmarks in virtual environments. Either
to develop guidelines for design and placement of
landmarks in VE [5] or to investigate using them as
navigation cues in way finding tasks [4][7].
Landmarks could be objects initially exist in the
environment or artificial objects to serve as
foundations for distance or direction estimation [12].
Although artificial landmarks can help as way
finding cues it discourage the acquisition of spatial
knowledge which is the main goal of any way finding
system. For example a user may stick to a basic mental
representation of the environment depending heavily
on the dominant cue and missing other important
spatial information about the environment [13]. In this
paper we automatically select landmarks from existing
objects in the VE, thus we can help the user to get the
basic landmark knowledge without losing other spatial
information.

1.3. Spatial data mining
Explosive growth of data created the need for the
automatic transformation of data into useful
knowledge. Data mining is the process of discovering
implicit, non trivial, previously unknown, and
potentially useful information from data [14].
Spatial data mining is the process of discovering
interesting, implicit, and useful patterns from large
spatial data [15], where spatial data is defined as a

collection of spatially referenced objects, such as
houses, supermarkets…etc.
Spatial objects have two categories of attributes
may be measured, spatial and non-spatial. Spatial
attributes of a spatial object includes location, shape,
and other geometric or topological properties. Non
spatial attributes include other information like
building activity, building age.
Spatial data mining techniques are useful in
detecting spatial outliers. A Spatial outlier is a spatial
object whose non-spatial attribute values differ
significantly from those of other objects in its spatial
neighborhood, or a spatial object whose non-spatial
attributes are extreme relative to its neighbors, even
though the attributes may not be significantly different
from the entire population. For example, a new house
in an old neighborhood of a metropolitan area is a
spatial outlier based on the non-spatial attribute
“building age”. Spatial outlier detection is useful in
applications like credit card fraud, voting irregularity,
geographic information systems, and location-based
services.
In order to process virtual environment data for
landmarks extraction, we can model the virtual
environment after the model for spatial data used in
spatial data mining context [15].
All objects in a virtual environment can be
considered as spatial objects. The location and
direction information are represented as spatial
attributes. Other information like color, activity, and
assessment tags are non spatial attributes. For example,
a white hospital building in the fifth street can be
described as a spatial object with the following
attributes:
x Location = “fifth street”
x Color = “white”
x Building activity = “hospital”.
Since Landmarks by definition are objects with
distinguishable attributes, we used a spatial outlier
technique to automatically identify the Landmarks in
VE.

2. Proposed Technique
2.1. Outlier Algorithm
Outliers have been defined as observations in a data
set which appear to be inconsistent with the remainder
of that set of data [15]. A spatial outlier is a spatial
object whose non-spatial attribute values are
significantly different from the values of its spatial
neighborhood objects. A spatial neighborhood is a
subset of the spatial objects based on a spatial
relationship such as distance or adjacency. For
example a spatial neighborhood of a building can be

the all the buildings in the same street, or all buildings
with distance less than one km.
Spatial outlier detection algorithms involve the
following steps [16][17]:
x Given a set of spatial objects X = {x1, x2. . . xn},
an attribute function f is defined as a mapping
from X to R (real numbers). Attribute function f
(xi) represents the attribute value of spatial
object xi.
x For a given object xi, define Nk(xi) as the k
neighbors of object xi based on a selected
neighborhood criteria.
x A neighborhood function g is defined as a map
from X to R such that for each xi, g(xi) returns a
summary statistic of attribute values of all the
spatial points inside Nk(xi). g(xi) can be the mean
or median attribute value of the k neighbors of
xi.
x To detect spatial outliers, the attribute value of
each point xi is compared with those attribute
values of its neighbors Nk(xi) using comparison
function h, which is a function of f and g. For
example, h can be the difference f íg or ratio
f/g.
x Yi =| (h (xi) - µ )/ı | for i = 1, 2. . . n. an object xi
is a spatial outlier if yi > ș, where ș is a
threshold depends on specified confidence level,
for example confidence level is 95 where ș # 2.
In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm
introduced by Chang-Tien Lu [17] has been used,
In which g(xi) is the median of the data set {f(x) : x
 Nk(xi)}, and the comparison function is h(xi) =
f(xi) í g(xi). The Object corresponding to largest yi
is considered a spatial outlier among its
neighborhood.

2.2. Landmarks Selection
The major challenge in applying spatial outlier
technique is determining non-spatial attributes, which
are used to formulate the landmarks attractiveness.
The different attributes used in this work is based
on the models developed for way finding in real
environments. Although there are some differences
between real and virtual environments, the principles
and techniques of real world navigation and way
finding applied successfully in virtual environment [1].
Moreover, some researchers proved that the navigation
process is the same whether the environment is virtual
or real [5].
N.G. Vinson [5] summarized attributes from urban
planning studies that make building memorable and its
location easier to recall (Significant height, Complex
shape, Large, visible signs, Surrounded by
landscaping, Free standing (visible), Bright exterior,
Unique exterior color, texture ) and introduced them as

guidelines for designing landmarks in virtual
environments.
Raubal [11] proposed model for measures to
specify landmark saliency of building. The
attractiveness of landmarks is determined by the
components for visual attraction (façade area, shape
factor, shape deviation, color, visibility), semantic
attraction (cultural and historical importance, explicit
mark),
and
structural
attraction
(important
intersections, boundaries, regions). The three
components are assigned to predefined weights to
adapt with context (mode of travel) or individual user
preferences.
Elias [10] used the flowing attributes: Building
activity, size, number of intermediate neighbors,
distance from road and height to extract the landmarks
in routing information system.
Due to the computational limitations, virtual
environments often have less visual, spatial and
locomotive details. In this paper, we used five
attributes to identify visual, semantic, and structural
attractiveness of objects. Table 1 summarizes the
selected attributes.
For visual attraction, building height, color and
width is directly obtained from the VE. We assume
that all buildings are colored and the semantic
attractiveness is expressed by the building activity.
Finally, the building order is used to express structural
attractiveness, as buildings close to corners are more
candidates to be landmarks for their relation to
navigator decision points.

2.3. Problem Formulation
We formally define the problem of extracting
landmarks from virtual environment using spatial
outlier technique as follows:
x Given X = {x1, x2. . . xn} represents a set of
spatial objects in certain spatial neighborhood.
x Each street in the virtual city has X set of
objects
x For each street, at least one object has to be
identified as a Landmark; while the other
objects are considered to be spatial
neighborhood.
x For each spatial object we define m nonspatial attributes to be used for landmarks
identification.

Calculate the attribute function f(xi), which
represents the attribute value of spatial object
xi.
Calculate ai(xj), the attractiveness function for
each attribute; 1  i  m, 1  j  n.
For all spatial objects, An×m, matrix represents
objects and their corresponding attractiveness
function values.
We define Wm, weights matrix, which
contains corresponding weights for each
attribute.
We define Z matrix as Z=A × W; the
landmark will be object with maximum value
in Z.

At least one landmark will exist each time the
above technique is applied. Using dynamic weights in
our problem is motivated by the relative quality of
landmark for different users (tourist, business
travelers…etc), and for other environmental
constraints. For example navigating in foggy
environment differs from navigation in daylight.

3. Dataset Generation
Three virtual cities have been simulated. Each city
have grid of streets, which is a typical design for new
cities [13], with different number of blocks as shown in
Table 2. Different types of buildings, as shown in
Table 4, are distributed according to realistic
distribution from GIS data. Buildings are randomly
distributed on city blocks given a predefined minimum
and maximum number of occurrences for each building
type in each street and block.

has been developed using OpenGL Performer 3.1.

2.4. Attractiveness function
The attractiveness function is a direct application
for spatial outlier algorithm (sec 2.1). The attribute
functions are defined as follows:
x For height, width, corresponding values computed
directly from VE,
x For color we used the following formula to
express RGB value of a building:
65536×Blue value+256×Green value+Red value.
x For building activity, the following function
calculated to express object dissimilarity with
surrounding objects: Number of objects with
different activities / total number of objects
x For building order, To Identify a landmark along a
street, Buildings near to the corners are more
likely to be identified as Landmark. The order is
calculated according to the street center as shown
in figure 2.

generated cities

4. Experiments
We designed two experiments to evaluate the
proposed spatial outlier algorithm in identifying
landmarks in large VE. The experiments applied on the
three cities generated in section 3. In the first
experiment, we initially used equal weights for all
attributes. About 80%, 78% and 45% of objects are
identified as landmarks, for city1, city2 and city3
respectively (Figure 3). The identification of landmark
is statistically significant at confidence interval 80100% (Table 3). Identified landmarks with high
confidence are expected to be easily recognized by
human.
In the second experiment (Figure 4), we analyzed
the output of the outlier algorithm. Contribution ratio is

used to measure the ability of a certain building type to
be a landmark. Contribution ratio for each building
type is the percentage between the number of
landmarks and the number of buildings. It can be seen
that, the building types with the five highest
contribution ratios are governmental buildings, camps,
university institution, factories, and gardens. This
results prove that the outlier algorithm is successfully
identified the landmarks in the sense that objects with
low occurrence, according to the used distribution, are
highly identified as landmarks.

5. Conclusion
We proposed a technique for using spatial data
mining to identify automatically landmarks in large
virtual environments. The selected landmarks can be
used to enrich basic landmark knowledge and for
developing further procedure and survey knowledge,
which are essential for way finding tasks.
We
empirically
evaluated
the
statistical
significance of the proposed technique (spatial outlier
algorithm) in identifying landmarks in VE using three
datasets with different number of objects based on a
realistic distribution of building based on one of
newest and well designed Egyptian cities.
