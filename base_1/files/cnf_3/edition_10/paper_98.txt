Bibliometric maps are scaled representations of clusters
of papers and provide an overview of a scientific field as
provided by those papers and the references between them.
We have enhanced our interactive bibliometric explorer
(iBEX) to visualise the distribution of phrases over such
bibliometric maps. Assuming that generic (non-content­
bearing) phrases occur in most of the papers in the map,
those phrases confined to a specific part of the map will
probably be more content-bearing than those distributed
all over the map. Such knowledge can eventually be used
to evaluate a selection of words and phrases.

number of citations an actor has received, compared to the
number of citations that a paper is likely to receive in the
scientific field at hand[4]. The analysis may additionally
include a list of benchmark actors or other additional statis­
tics to compare the actors subject to analysis more clearly.

Bibliometric maps

A bibliometric map is a scaled, two-dimensional rep­
resentation of a clustering of attributes of scientific pa­
pers.

More specifically: using a selection of attributes,

we compile an association matrix.

This matrix is used

as the basis for an hierarchical clustering algorithm. The

Introduction

hierarchy is cut off at a specific point according to some

The use for bibliometric maps (BM's) is the same as that
for an ordinary street map: both are intended to guide the
reader through a landscape. For an ordinary street map this
landscape will be something very real. But for a 8M the de­
picted landscape is a totally abstract and for some readers
this landscape will be an unfamiliar one. Therefore, we first
provide a short introduction into bibliometrics and biblio­
metric maps. After that, we will sketch our motivations be­
hind this endeavour. Then we will describe a sample anal­
ysis with some early experiences with the application. And
finally we will present some conclusions.

well-defined criteria. The resulting clusters are then used
to create a distance matrix, which is mapped onto a two­
dimensional space using a

Multiple Dimensional Scaling

algorithm. The result is a list of clusters and coordinates in
a two-dimensional space that makes up our map.
It is important to note that only the

distances

between

the clusters in the maps bear any meaning: those clusters
mapped closer together are likely to have more attributes in
common than clusters placed further away from each other.
More specifically, there is no meaning attached to the axes,
as might be the case in other kind of displayed material.
There are different types of maps, corresponding to dif­
ferent attributes of papers and different ways of creating as­

sociation matrices between these attributes. For example,
we could make a map using the most-cited actors, where

A bibliometric analysis starts by collecting a set of pa­
pers published in journals, proceedings or other types of
peer-reviewed paper collections. This is usually done with
the use of expert knowledge. For example, someone work­
ing for an organisation involved in a bibliometric analysis
is asked to provide a set of keywords or journals which de­
scribe the scientific field his organisation is active in.
Depending on the granularity of the analysis, papers are
associated with entities like authors, organisations or coun­
tries. These entities are commonly referred to as "actors".

the actors are associated by the number of times they ap­
pear together in the reference lists of papers (see for exam­
ple [6]). Alternatively, we can make a map using a list of
frequently appearing words or phrases taken from the title
or abstract of the papers (as pioneered in [2]). In our work,
we have concentrated on the latter type of map, using Noun
Phrases (NP's)[5] instead of just (single) words. Such NP's
are phrases taken directly from the title or abstract of the
paper, but extracted (and normalised) using a parser for the
English language.
Although the maps may have been built using associa­
tion matrices of selected paper attributes, they (naturally)

also provide an overview of the papers from which the at­

tributes were extracted. And therein lies their use: they pro­
vide a condensation of the set of papers and can be used to
e.g. provide nuance and additional information by display­
ing related structures closer together. And as such, they
can be a great additional tool to enhance the comprehen­
sion (and as a result, their use) of bibliometric analyses.

The maps we create are often used to support science­
sions need a tool that enables them to retrieve details about
the structure of a scientific field, in order to properly sup­
port their policy[7). They usually have a good knowledge
of the coarser structures in the field and bibliometric maps
enable them to use this knowledge to get at these finer de­
tails.
Partly due to this demand, we have started to create and
deploy interactive maps[l]. These interactive maps have
become a complete application which we have baptised

IBEXI. With this application we have created an Informa­
tion Retrieval tool that is able to retrieve different combi­
nations of bibliometric statistics and other data based on
selected clusters in the map, or the map as a whole.
The application also enables the user to search for spe­
cific elements, like journals, authors, institutes or words,
and show the associated papers (or their citations) as num­
bers or charts on the map. This allows the user to become
acquainted with the abstract landscape depicted before him

by looking for familiar elements - just like one would do
on that ordinary street map.

there are a number of advantages in using terms taken di­
2
rectly from papers, such as:
they provide the most up-to-date and direct connec­
tion to the scientific activity described in the paper;

that completeness and (as a result) the usability.
Developing such a selection process, even for a welI­
defined, specific task, is an open research question (and
one we are actively pursuing). A commonly used crite­
rion to get a grasp on things is that generic (non-content­
bearing) words are distributed randomly (evenly) over a
corpus, whereas content-bearing words are only used in a
limited set of (semantically) related papers[3]. Since a 8M
consists of clusters of related papers and displays related
clusters closer together, one would suppose that content­
bearing terms (words, phrases) are mostly contained in
clusters in a specific region of the map.
The use for such a visualisation is twofold. First, it pro­
vides a way to gain insight into the spread of a specific tenn
or list of terms. And second (as a result) this can be used
to evaluate a list of terms (that may have been generated
automatically) on its appropriateness as the basis for a BM.

ters in the maps, with some basic functionality to visu­
alise the distribution of a list of phrases.

Such a spread

simply associates each (selected) cluster with an integer
n ;::: O.

This integer represents the number of (distinct)

papers containing one of the selected NP's. This number
is plotted on each cluster and the colour of the cluster is
changed: clusters containing close to zero papers will fade
into the background whereas the clusters containing a rela­

Figure 1 provides an overview of our application. The
clusters in the maps are represented by filled circles, the
area of which corresponds to. the number of papers in that
cluster.
As can be seen, the map consists of a two large clusters
(many papers) in the centre, with some smaller clusters in
the vicinity and a lot of very small clusters (even fewer
papers) scattered around them4.
In figure 1, cluster 1 is selected. In the application (and
not shown here). this would give this cluster a distinctively
darker colour than the other clusters. For this selected clus­
ter, we have retrieved the journals that have been clustered
to.gether in the first stage of our map-creation process. The
second list contains the first part o.f the most frequent NP's
in the selected journal "Physical Review B". And below

nism, so. we may e.g. select a number of journal NP's as
well as NP's we specifically searched for.
Figure I shows a visualisation of the distribution of the
relative number (more on that in the next section) of papers
containing the selected NP "neural network". This is the
o.nly element currently on the clipboard. The clusters con­
taining a relatively large number of papers associated with
this NP are positioned in like a sickle-like shape from the
cluster 13 via cluster 8 to cluster II.Also, although barely
visible, cluster 17 (positioned at the top of the map) has
also been given a dark colour. But the term spread is really
confined to specific regions of the map only.
