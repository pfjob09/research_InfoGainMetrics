Abstract
The Reorderable Matrix is a simple visualization method
for quantitative tabular data. This paper examines how
first-time users interact with the Reorderable Matrix and
how well they perform a simple task of finding correlating
attributes. Visualizing a set of data is a common task in various activities such as decision-making or opinion-forming.
Typical situations are a person making business-related decisions, a doctor examining test results of a patient or an
engineer making choices between different constructs. All
these situations involve examining complex data interactions in a limited time. In this experiment the participants
were interacting with the Reorderable Matrix for the first
time and tried to find correlating attributes from an unfamiliar set of data.

1. Introduction
Jacques Bertin wrote a book called Graphics and
Graphic Information Processing [1] over 30 years ago. In
that book, he presents a method for studying a data matrix
with an interactive visualization method called the Reorderable Matrix (also known as the Permutation Matrix). The
basic idea is to replace numeric cell values with appropriately sized ink blobs and to allow the user to change the
row and the column orders of the data matrix. Although
this sounds trivial, it allows the user to explore the data set
in surprisingly powerful ways.
The Reorderable Matrix is not generally implemented in
commercial products, but it has been used in experimental
tools (e.g. VisuLab [6] and Table Lens [4]) and it has inspired new visualization techniques (e.g. Survey Plots in
INSPECT [3]).

Bertin’s foundation is that information is a relationship.
Graphical information processing is about revealing these
relationships among data elements, data subsets or data sets.
Visualization of a data set must be such that these three levels are retained. Fig. 1 illustrates how the Reorderable Matrix displays these three levels in graphical representation.
Reordering rows and columns allows us to see similarities and sets in the underlying data. Bertin claims that this
is a natural characteristic of human vision and visual perception and does not require any special skills.
This paper describes the results of an experimental study
in which the users interacted with the Reorderable Matrix.
The idea was to introduce the Reorderable Matrix to persons
who had no prior experience with it and to study how they
would interact with it. Interaction was evaluated from the
perspective of usability.

2. Reorderable Matrix
The Reorderable matrix is a simple interactive visualization artifact (IVA) for tabular data. It is the unifying concept
throughout Bertin’s work. This construction places multivariate data into a matrix with attributes along the x-axis
and objects along the y-axis. Attributes can be defined in
different domains and attributes can have different types
(continuous, discrete, ordinal). Table 2 in the appendix
presents a typical data matrix that can be visualized using
the Reorderable Matrix. The visualization can be seen in
Fig. 2.

[1, pp. 23, 44, 80], and more have been proposed. One
particularly interesting variation is to color-code the values
below and above average with different colors [5].

2.1. Operations
Users can manipulate the Reorderable Matrix with four
simple operations:
† Rows and columns can be dragged into a new position.
† Rows and columns can be sorted in an ascending or a
descending order.
Dragging a row into a new position changes the order in
which the attributes are listed. Sorting a column has the
same effect. Likewise, dragging a column into a new position or sorting a row changes the order of columns.

3. An Empirical Study
Eleven participants (5 women, 6 men) were used in the
study. All participants were fluent computer users and the
majority of the participants had research interests related to
user interfaces and usability. None of the participants had
read Bertin’s book, nor were familiar with Bertin’s work in
general.

3.1. Test setting

Figure 2. Table 2 as a Reorderable Matrix.
Table 2 contains monthly data compiled from an imaginary hotel. The data contains various numbers describing
the clientele, varying in nationality, profession and age to
the average price of room and the average length of stay.
Most of the numbers are percent figures, except for the average length of stay, the average price of rooms and the information if there was a convention during that month or
not. The average length of stay is given in days and the
average price of room is, presumably, given in the local currency. Hotel management would use this kind of data to
design marketing, to define price structure, and to plan services offered for the customers.
On each row of the visualization the largest value (or
values) is displayed with a completely black square and the
smallest value (or values) is shown as an empty square. Values in between are shown as a black circle. The size of the
circle is in proportion to the smallest and the largest value.
There are several variations on how to display a Reorderable Matrix. Bertin himself gave a few of them in his book

A simple implementation of the Reorderable Matrix was
constructed as a standalone Java program. The program was
instrumented to collect all events of interest and to log them
with time-stamps with a resolution of one millisecond.
The user interface has simple controls. Dragging inside
the Reorderable Matrix will move the row or column underneath. As a side-effect, it is also possible to drag a row and a
column simultaneously. A mouse click just outside the matrix denotes a sort operation, depending on where the user
clicked. Fig. 3 illustrates sorting a row into an ascending
and a descending order.

Figure 3. Sorting a row into ascending and a
descending order.

The remaining controls are Undo and Redo, displayed as
buttons with arrows pointing either backward or forward,
and buttons that reset the matrix into its initial state. The
initial state is defined by the order in the data file.

Figure 5. Correlation coefficients in the Reorderable Matrix.

Figure 4. The user interface.
Fig. 4 also illustrates a situation where the matrix has
been arranged row-wise according to column 1.
Data from Bertin’s hotel example (Table 2) was used as
test material. Table 3 at the end of this article contains the
correlation matrix for Table 2.
The strongest correlation in Table 2 is the negative correlation between the percentage of tourists and the percentage
of businessmen.
Fig. 5 illustrates how the Reorderable Matrix visualizes
correlating objects. Strong correlation coefficients, having
an absolute value close to 1.00, are quite easy to see, but
weaker correlation is much harder to detect. The correlation coefficient for the pair % TOURISTS vs. % BUSINESSMEN is ¡ 1:00, and the correlation coefficient for the pair
% CLIENTELE FEMALE vs. % CLIENTS UNDER 20 is
+0:81.

3.2. Procedure
Each participant saw the test matrix in numerical form,
and the meaning of each attribute was explained to the participants. Participants had the chance to ask questions and

to make sure they understood the data.
In the next step the test program was shown and the available operations were demonstrated. Again, the participants
had the chance to ask questions and to try out briefly the
features in the user interface.
The test task was formulated as follows: “Try to find as
many as possible correlating attributes in twenty minutes.
Two attributes are correlating if one attribute’s values have
a rising or falling trend while the other attribute also has
either a rising or a falling trend. As soon as you detect
either a positive or a negative correlation, mention it, and
move on. If you see anything else of interest, you may also
mention it.”
While the participants examined the data with the Reorderable Matrix, the screen display was captured and the
subjects’ remarks were recorded. After a twenty minute test
session, the participant was interviewed.
The test task corresponds to Bertin’s levels two and
three, answering intermediate and overall questions about
the set of data. A typical intermediate level discovery from
Table 2 was “there seems to be a negative correlation between the percentage of tourists and the percentage of businessmen”. Likewise, a typical overall level finding was “the
room price is at its lowest during summer”.

4. Results
4.1. Interviews
Subjective user satisfaction was clearly positive. Only
two of the participants announced that they didn’t like to
use this kind of interface, and doubted its general usefulness. On the other hand, the rest of the participants found
the Reorderable Matrix to be interesting, exciting or otherwise positive.
Almost all of the participants said that the Reorderable
Matrix was easy to use. The only operation difficult to grasp
was the simultaneous moving of a row and a column. Most
of the subjects left this feature unused, and those who used

it, might have done so unintendedly. One exception was a
participant who used this feature a lot and with success. He
presumably had a good mental model for moving rows and
columns simultaneously that the others lacked.
Some participants were worried that the lack of domain
knowledge might have hindered their performance. They
expressed this usually by saying that “I wish I had my own
data to operate with”. However, none of the participants had
ever run a hotel, so this problem affected everyone.
The most common comment on the user interface was
about visibility. The test program did not indicate where
to click for the sort operations and during the drag operations there was no feedback. Because of the pre-test briefing, feedback was not considered a problem during tests.
But clearly a proper feedback is needed for a high quality
implementation.
Many of the participants mentioned grouping. They
wished either to move rows as one group, or to color or
highlight a group. The reason for this wish was that the
data contained obvious groups, like the nationalities or age
groups of the clientele. Since sorting moves rows into new
positions, a differently colored or otherwise highlighted
group would have stood out and made visual scanning more
efficient.

4.2. Operation patterns
Program instrumentation shows that the participants can
be classified into four categories according to the two most
frequently used operations. Table 1 summarizes this data.

Table 1. Patterns in operation use.
The most common strategy was to sort the Reorderable
Matrix along one of the rows, then move the similar or the
contradicting rows to inspect the situation.
The participants in category 1 did more MOVE ROWoperations than SORT ROW-operations. These participants
performed a sort operation and then took their time to arrange the visualization into a more readable setting. This
approach is similar to the strategy that Bertin suggests in

his book. However, the goal state of the arrangement varied.
In category 2 the participants used a similar tactic as in
category 1, except that they did not use as much effort to
arrange the matrix after the sort operation. Because of this,
they performed more SORT ROW-operations than MOVE
ROW-operations.
Participants in category 3 performed mainly sort operations, either horizontally or vertically, and used very little
effort to arrange the matrix after sorting. They performed
a sort operation, scanned the new state visually, and moved
on.
One of the participants chose not to use sorting at all and
preferred to arrange the matrix by hand.

4.3. Goal states
The goal state is the preferred arrangement of the Reorderable Matrix before reading it. For some of the participants, the goal state was simply the state produced by a sort
operation. But far more common was to do some arranging
before reading, as Table 1 shows.
Four distinct strategies were observed. The most common one was to keep the reference row as the top row. The
reference row was moved up either before or after the sort
operation. Two other strategies were to keep the reference
row in the bottom, or somewhere near the center of the matrix. One of the participants had a unique strategy: instead
of keeping the reference row stationary, he moved it through
the matrix and looked for similar ones.
Those participants who kept the reference row in the
middle of the matrix were more apt to read the visualization backwards, i.e., to build a black area and then see what
happened to be on those rows.

4.4. Performance
In this experiment the overall performance was estimated
by looking at the strengths of pair-wise correlations that
were observed. Correlation coefficients having an absolute
value above 0:7 were included, meaning that the coefficient
of determination was about 50% of the total variation. In
other words, this means that the independent variable explains about 50% of the total variation of the dependent
variable.
Table 4 tabulates the highest correlation values in Table 3
and lists how many of them each participant was able to
discover. On the average, the participants were able to find
about one third of the strongest correlations, and about one
half of the participants discovered the only ¡ 1:00 correlation coefficient. This is not bad considering that the data
was unfamiliar and that the test time was only twenty minutes. Also, looking at Table 4, it is apparent that finding

the positive correlation values was easier than finding the
negative ones.
The visualization in Fig. 6 summarizes the performanceoriented results. It displays the operation frequency data
from the program log file, and the observation and the correlation data. Correlating objects are presented as the number of pairs found, as the sum of all correlation coefficients,
and as the average strength of correlation coefficients found.
The absolute values of the correlation coefficients were used
in all computations.

is only true for finding a pair of correlating attributes – for
set-level discoveries such arranging is of course essential.
The Reorderable Matrix could be improved further by
automating the arrangement after a sort operation, as Hinterberger has suggested [2]. If similar rows would move
automatically next to each other, it would make the process
faster and it would make harder to bypass the obvious dependencies.
Looking at the current state of the art in interactive visualization artifacts, it seems strange that the Reorderable Matrix is not widely used. It is simple to implement and most
people learn to use it in a matter of minutes. The Reorderable Matrix visualization would be a nice feature for current
spreadsheet programs, instead of those countless variations
of static scatter, bar and pie charts.

The interesting parts in Fig. 6 are the lower right and
the upper left corners. As can be seen from the lower right
corner, the participants who found the most correlating objects had also relatively high average correlation strength.
All participants in this area used pattern 2 or pattern 3 in
their operation. This seems to support the idea that careful
reading is more productive than trying to produce the ‘best’
visualization for a given correlation.

5. Conclusions
The Reorderable Matrix is a simple and effective user
interface to reveal relations in a set of data. Its strength lies
in the fact that it takes advantage of the underused human
visual system.
This study shows that the best strategy for a novice user
to interpret a Reordable Matrix is to do a sort operation and
then take some time to read the view. It seems that moving
similar and complementary rows to their own groups is not
worthwhile, although this was the approach that was originally recommended by Bertin [1, p. 38]. However, this
