Abstract
It is speculated that the processing of different types
of information (e.g., quantitative, ordinal, or nominal
data) will be affected by what type of visual display is
used to present that information (e.g., line graphs,
shapes with varying levels of gray saturation, or shapes
of different colors). People are expected to be able to
more efficiently and accurately process and answer
questions about the visual displays if the type of display
(i.e., the representing dimension) provides neither too
much nor too little information and matches the type of
information (i.e., the represented dimension) being
processed. In the present study we found that in general
task performance was best when the represented and
representing dimensions match. An exception to this is
discussed.

1. Introduction
People often have trouble finding the right
information when looking at graphs. Sometimes this
leads to frustration, causes them to discontinue their
searching or results in them acquiring false information
due to the poor display. A clear understanding of which
display is best suited for various types of information
enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the user’s task.
A variety of graphic displays have been used such as
line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, matrices,
tables, networks, maps, and many others to represent
different types of information. These displays can be
categorized under a common name, relational
information displays (RIDs), which are displays that
represent relations among types of information (e.g., a
person's name and her finish in a race) [1].
In this study, RIDs have been analyzed to answer the
question of which display is the most effective in
representing different types of information. The study
investigated three types of displays: line graph, gray
saturation, and color, and three types of information:
quantitative, ordinal, and nominal.
The mapping between type of display and type of
information can be studied effectively by the distributed

cognition framework because cognitive activity in RID
related tasks is distributed into two different
representations: an internal representation and an
external representation [1].

2. Theory
2.1. Distributed Cognition Framework
Internal representations are information such as
propositions, schemas, productions, and mental images
that reside in our mind, whereas external representations
are physical symbols, graphs, objects as well as the
constraints or relations embedded in the physical setting
(e.g., the visual and spatial layouts of diagrams) [2].
In an example of a RID task (see Figure 1), the
density of the circle codes the value it represents.
Viewers are told that the denser the circle, the more
value it represents. By a visual inspection of both
external representations, the perceptual difference that
(a) has more density than (b) can easily be identified.
However, the decision of whether (a) represents more
value than (b) can be made only by referring to the
internal representation (i.e., a rule you have learned) that
the denser the circle, the more value it represents. Thus,
RID tasks relate two distributed components: an internal
representation and an external representation.

Figure 1. An example of a RID task. Each display
represents an assigned number and follows the given rule
that the denser the circle, the more value it represents.
A key difference between the traditional cognitive
view and the distributed cognition view is on how each
considers the role of external representations in cognitive
processing.
The traditional approach to cognition

assumes that external objects are limited to being merely
a peripheral memory aid [2]. This can be easily accepted
when we consider that written digits are used as memory
aids for calculation. Consider multiplying 771 by 242
using paper and pencil (see Figure 2). The external
representations are the shapes and positions of the
symbols and the spatial relations of partial products.
Notice the writing of partial products (1542, 3084, and
1542) during the calculation. This frees working memory
and allows one to concentrate summing digits [3].

question of which display is optimal in conveying
different types of information.

2.2. Scale of Measurements in RIDs
Zhang [1] developed a theoretical framework that
accounts for the representational effects of all RIDs. The
framework suggests that although there are no optimal
displays that are efficient for all types of tasks, there can
be a correct or incorrect mapping between the
representation of a display and the structure of a task.
One aspect of his framework involved the psychological
scale of the information that the display conveys.
Stevens [8] identified four types of psychological
scales: ratio, interval, ordinal, and nominal. Each type
can be characterized as having or lacking the following
properties: category, magnitude, equal interval, and
absolute zero (see Table 1).
Table 1. The Properties of Scales

Figure 2. An example of an external representation used
as a memory aid.
In contrast, the distributed cognition approach
explores how cognitive activity is distributed across
minds, external artifacts, groups of people, and across
space and time [4, 5]. In this view, external
representations are not simply memory aids; rather, they
are so intrinsic to many cognitive tasks that they can
strongly guide and constrain cognitive behavior [6].
One of the most promising methodologies that has
been adopted in distributed cognition is the
representational
analysis
which
investigates
representational effect. The representational effect refers
to the phenomenon that different representations of a
common formal structure can cause dramatically
different cognitive behaviors. A good example is the
representation of numbers [7]. Arabic numerals are more
efficient than Roman numerals for multiplication, even
when both types of numerals represent the same numbers.
For example, 73 x 27 is easier than LXXIII x XXVII
because in the latter one, we have to convert each Roman
numeral to Arabic prior to multiplication [2]. In this case,
we are looking at two different representations, Arabic
numerals and Roman numerals, which represent the
same information.
Representational analyses have been conducted in
various areas, mostly in problem solving and reasoning
domains such as Tower of Hanoi and Tic-Tac-Toe [6].
These studies commonly found that the form of a
representation determines what information can be
perceived, what processes can be activated, and what
structures can be discovered in a problem solving
situation.
Representational analysis can effectively investigate
RIDs as well. For each type of information (quantitative,
ordinal, nominal) different features (length, density,
color) conveying isomorphic information can be
compared to see how they lead to differences in
cognitive processing. This ties back to the original

The "category" property means that the instances on
a scale can be distinguished from one another. The
"magnitude" property means that one instance on a scale
can be recognized as greater than, less than, or equal to
another instance on the same scale. The "equal interval"
property means that the magnitude of an instance
represented by a unit on the scale is the same regardless
of where on the scale the unit is. An "absolute zero" is a
value which indicates that nothing at all of the property
being represented exists.
Every dimension, whether it is a physical dimension,
such as the length of a line, or a more abstract dimension
such as an amount of money, is on a certain type of scale
[1]. In RIDs, there are two dimensions: (1) the
information and, (2) the display that conveys that
information. We can identify the scale property for each
dimension and form a two dimensional matrix.

2.3. Represented and Representing Dimensions
The two dimensions are formally titled as:
represented and representing dimensions.
The
represented dimensions of a RID are the dimensions of
an original domain that are to be represented by various
RIDs. The representing dimensions of a RID are the
physical dimensions of the RID that are used to represent
the dimensions of the original domain (See Figure 3) [1].

be represented internally or is not represented at all. For
example, in Figure 3H, color possesses no ordinal
information about the rankings of the players. If a rule is
given, for example, that blue is higher than red in relative
standings, the user is forced to refer to their internally
represented rule prior to making a decision about which
color represents bigger value [1].
The goal of the present research is to examine
implications of the represented and representing
dimensions framework. The key hypothesis is that when
the represented and representing dimensions match, a
person's performance will be best. This leads to three
predictions:
1) Performance in retrieving quantitative
information is optimal when the display has the
same quantitative scale property.
2) Performance in retrieving ordinal information is
optimal when the display has the same ordinal
scale property.
3) Performance in retrieving nominal information
is optimal when the display has the same
nominal scale property.

competition.
In Figure 3, there are three ways of presenting
information: length, density and color. The three types
of displays were chosen to represent three types of scale
properties (quantitative, ordinal, nominal) each conveys.
In order for a representation to be efficient and
accurate, the represented and representing dimensions
should match in scale. In the three displays on the
diagonal in Figure 3 (A, E, I), the scale of the
represented dimensions matches the scale of the
representing dimensions. For example, in Figure 3A,
swimming records are represented by the length of the
bars, which has the same quantitative property. In Figure
3E, the ranking of swimmers is represented by density
which has the same ordinal property. In this condition,
the user is told to assume that the denser the saturation,
the higher the rank. In Figure 3I, each individual’s
nationality is represented by color which has the same
nominal property.
In the three displays above the diagonal (B, C, F),
the representing dimensions have more information than
the represented dimensions. The extra information of the
representing information may cause misperceptions on
the represented dimensions. For example, in Figure 3B,
a gold medalist may be perceived as twice as superior as
a bronze medalist. This is a misperception, because
gold, silver, and bronze medal only indicate the relative
(ordinal) standings among the players. In other words,
the display does not intend to provide quantitative
information. This type of potential misleading is termed
the language problem in Mackinlay’s psychological
analysis [9].
In the three displays below the diagonal (D, G, H),
the representing dimensions have less information than
the represented dimensions. In these displays, the extra
information of the represented dimensions either has to

undergraduate students that were enrolled in introductory
psychology courses at the Georgia Institute of
Technology who volunteered for the experiment to earn
course credit.
3.1.2. Materials Participants viewed a set of RIDs
consisting of a display and question on the same screen
(see Appendix 1-9). Flash and Flash Actionscript were
used to implement the condition sets on IBM PCs.
3.1.3. Procedure Each person completed a presession in order to learn how to respond to the question
set when viewing a display. An example question that is
comparable to the actual question set from all three
levels (quantitative, ordinal, nominal) was provided.
The experimenter read the question out loud and walked
through each step of understanding the question, viewing
the display, acquiring appropriate information, and
selecting an answer. Participants were asked at each step
whether they understood. This orientation procedure
was used so that everyone would begin the experiment
already accustomed to the environment.
After this orientation, participants performed nine
information retrieval tasks that corresponded to nine
types of trials shown in Figure 3. There were four
instances of each trial type resulting in 36 trials per
participant. All contents were records from a fictional
400 meter swimming competition. The task for each
condition depended on its represented dimension
(column). For example, in 3A, 3D, and 3G (see Figure
3), a participant was asked to answer a question that
could be solved only by considering the quantitative

property of the display such as asking who was three
times faster than Emily (see Appendices 1, 4, 7).
Participants were asked to click on the answer at the
bottom.
In 3B, 3E, and 3H, a participant was asked to answer
a question that could be solved only by considering the
ordinal property of the display such as asking
participants to order the rankings of the swimmers (see
Appendices 2, 5, 8).
In 3C, 3F, and 3I, a participant was asked to answer
a question that could be solved only by considering the
nominal property of the display such as asking for
swimmer’s home state (see Appendices 3, 6, 9).
One methodological comment about the density
display needs to be made. We wanted to be sure that
each density level was discriminable. For example, in
Appendix 5, the density level that represents Emily is
distinguishable against the others. When levels are laid
from black to white, there is a limited number of separate
levels that can be acquired maintaining those
discriminable. Each RGB level for gray saturation
increases together from 0 to 255 (e.g. R = 2, G = 2, B = 2
and R = 4, G = 4, B = 4) where 0 is black and 255 is
white. Informal pilot testing suggested that when the
interval between levels becomes less than about 36, the
visual distinction among levels starts to break down.
Therefore, the experiment used eight density levels (i.e.,
a set of eight choices) that had an interval greater than 36.
3.1.4. Design The experiment was a mixed design
with two within-subjects variables (represented and
representing dimensions) and one between-subjects
variable (four possible orders of the 36 trials). The
dependent measures were whether or not a task was done
correctly and the time taken to do the task.
To
avoid
possible
sequential
effects,
counterbalancing methods were used. The questions and
the choice sets were ordered so as to prevent participants
from answering with the information from previous trials.
In addition, two constraints were implemented when
randomizing the order of trials. First, the same type of
question (quantitative, ordinal, nominal) could not be
asked consecutively. Second, the same type of display
(length, density, color) could not be shown on
consecutive trials. These constraints resulted in four sets
of computer generated random orders (pseudo orders)
with each order having at least 10 participants.

3.2. Results and Discussion
Statistical analyses were performed by taking the
following steps: (1) three-way ANOVA (represented
dimensions vs representing dimensions vs pseudo orders),
(2) simple effect analysis based on planned hypotheses,
and (3) a step-wise regression analysis. Pseudo order has
no effect and all results and analyses will be collapsed
over this variable.
ANOVA Analysis among the three dimensions (See
Table 3) indicates that there is a main effect of display
type (length, density, color), F(2,88) = 125.51, p < .001,

and task (quantitative, ordinal, nominal), F(2,88) =
392.07, p < .001. A significant two-way interaction
between display and task was found, F(4, 176) = 71.61, p
< .001.
This analysis was based on reaction time that
included both correct and incorrect trials.
For
completeness, another analysis was performed excluding
incorrect trials.
Excluding incorrect trials, there continued to be a
main effect of display type (length, density, color),
F(2,88) = 8.61, p < .001, and task (quantitative, ordinal,
nominal), F(2,88) = 33.51, p < .001. A significant twoway interaction between display and task was also found,
F(4, 176) = 6.46, p < .001.
Simple Effects Analysis The interaction between
display and task suggests analyzing simple effects at
each level. Simple main effects and simple contrasts
were analyzed to test the three hypotheses (see Table 2).
Results indicate that all three levels (quantitative, ordinal,
nominal) of tasks have a significant simple effect on
displays.

To test the first hypothesis, that performance in
retrieving quantitative information is optimal when the
display has the same quantitative scale property, simple
contrasts between length (in line graphs) and density and
between length and color were analyzed. Results
indicate that the length display conveying quantitative
information yielded significantly faster reaction time
than the other two (see mean differences in Table 3).
Therefore, the first hypothesis was supported.
To test the second hypothesis, that performance in
retrieving ordinal information is optimal when the
display has the same ordinal scale property, simple
contrasts between density and length and between
density and color were analyzed. Results indicate that
while the density display conveying ordinal information
yielded significantly faster reaction time than color, it did

not differ from length. Potential reasons for this are
addressed in the general discussion.
To test the third hypothesis, that performance in
retrieving nominal information is optimal when the
display has the same nominal scale property, simple
contrasts between color and length and between color
and density were analyzed. Results indicate that the
color display conveying nominal information yielded
significantly faster reaction time than the other two.
Therefore, the third hypothesis was supported.

Regression A stepwise multiple-regression analysis
was carried out on reaction time. There were 1728 data
points, 36 (one per task) for each of the 48 participants.
To code categorical predictors such as display and
task, dummy coding was used. For example, displaytype was represented by two variables (diplaydummy1
and displaydummy2) that could take on values of 0 or 1
(0, 0 would mean quantitative, 0, 1 would mean ordinal,
and 1, 0 would mean nominal).
Suppose
displaydummy1 were to enter into the regression
equation. This would mean that the nominal display was
significantly different from the other two displays.
Similarly, if displaydumm2 entered the equation, it
would mean that the ordinal display was significantly
different from the other two displays. In order to find
out whether the quantitative display was different though,
the dummy variables would have to be recoded so that
either 0, 1 or 1, 0 was assigned to represent a quantitative
display. Thus, two regression analyses were run in order
to cover all possible levels.
Table 3 summarizes a regression equation that
includes length and color levels in display factor and
quantitative and nominal levels in task factor while Table
4 summarizes a regression equation that includes density
and color levels in display factor and ordinal and
nominal levels in task factor.
At each step, an “F-to-enter” statistic was calculated
for each predictor to determine which one would enter
the equation next. The predictor with the largest F-toenter value was entered into the equation at step n. The
criteria set for F-to-enter were at .05 and F-to-remove
at .1.

The predictors that ended up in the final two
equations are as follows:
1. task (quantitative, ordinal, nominal): Collectively,
three levels in task explained the variance of reaction
time the most. While the ordinal task (see Appendices 2,
5, 8) required participants to analyze and select eight
choices (marginal mean of 33.41 sec), the nominal task
(see Appendices 3, 6, 9) required a single response
(marginal mean of 9.11 sec).
2. correctness: This represents whether each
response was correct or not. It indicates that participants
were slower on the trials on which they were incorrect.
3. display (length, density, color): Collectively, the
three levels in display explained the variance of reaction
time significantly. Participants were the slowest in the
color task (marginal mean of 38.69) and the fastest in the
length task (marginal mean of 14.85).
4. English first: This represents whether English
was the participant’s first language. Because the task
requires understanding the question in English it makes
sense that domestic students were faster. However, it is
interesting to see that SAT verbal scores did not enter the
regression equation.

5. trial: This codes for effect of serial order. It
shows that participants became faster over tasks.
6. gender: This codes participant’s gender. This
shows males were slower than females.
Potential predictor variables that did not end up in
the final equations were: age, GPA, SAT verbal scores,
and SAT math scores. Ultimately, about 47% of the
variance in participant’s reaction time on each task was
accounted for by the final equation.

4. General Discussion
The key hypothesis in this study was generally
supported: optimal performance will occur when there is
a match between the represented and representing
dimensions. However, an exception was observed in
length versus density for conveying ordinal information.
In the original represented and representing
dimensions framework, length has an additional scale of
measurement (quantitative) over density (ordinal).
Zhang [1] suggested that due to this redundant scale of
measurement, viewers may be misled to perceive
unintended quantitative information in the line graph.
For example, in Appendix 2, the difference between Paul
and Alexis is that one was 60th and the other 30th in
rankings. While this is only a relative standing, due to
the quantitative nature of length the viewer might
conclude that Alexis was twice as fast as Paul.
We assumed that such mistakes would lead to longer
reaction times. One reason we did not find a cost to
using line length for ordinal information is because our
ordinal task clearly directs users to focus on ordinal
information. This might reduce the chance of users
being misled. Future research might use less-directive
instructions (better mirroring the real world) to see if the
cost of the mismatch emerges.
Another possible factor to consider is Mackinlay’s
psychological analysis on ranking of perceptual tasks
over ordinal information. He suggested that density is
better than length in conveying ordinal information
primarily because while length judgment suffers from
distance effect density does not.
For example, in Figure 4, while the comparison of
size (ordinal information) in lines (length) is easily
perceived in (A), it is difficult to do so in (B). On the
other hand, density judgment does not suffer from the
distance effect.
However, while it is true that length suffers from the
distance effect, density also has its own limitation in that
there are not many levels between black and white that
are discriminable from one another. As mentioned
earlier, while eight density levels seemed to be the
perceptual limit with our computer monitors, length can
have an unlimited number of representations as long as
the screen real estate permits it.

5. Conclusion
This study contributes to the foundational theory of
Information Visualization. The main focus is to provide
a fundamental advancement in our understanding of how
visualization should build on human limitations and
capabilities.
While Bertin provided a classical theory on
graphical semiotics [10], Cleveland and McGill [11]
developed a ranking of quantitative tasks using
psychophysics law and their own empirical study.
Mackinlay [9] complements this theory by providing
psychological analysis over ordinal and nominal tasks.
Zhang [1] combines all this into the represented and
representing dimensions in the light of distributed
cognition framework.
This study has shown that with the exception of the
ordinal task, the scale of measure between the task (i.e.,
represented dimension) and the display (i.e., representing
dimension) should match in order for a representation to
be efficient and accurate.
