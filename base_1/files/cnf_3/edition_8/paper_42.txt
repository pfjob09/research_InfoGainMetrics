Abstract
In an attempt to regionalize and visualize regions of
information space, we offer a method for regionalization
based on predetermined area relationships. This problem
can be conceptualized as an inverse multiplicatively
weighted Voronoi diagram. To compute such a diagram,
we offer an adaptive algorithm. Initial testing indicates
good results and quick convergence.

1. Introduction: Information Space
Regionalization
To improve navigation and assessment of
information systems, authors from various disciplines are
exploring the applicability and usefulness of
cartographic techniques for visualizing and mapping
abstract information spaces [11, 6, 5, 9, 10, 18]. Since
these spaces cannot be directly observed íthey are
largely methodological artifactsí their dimensionality,
metric and extent are either a priori chosen [20, 4, 19,
21, 17, 15] or instead inferred from secondary
information.
An example of the latter is a method proposed by
Buttenfield & Reitsma [3] and Reitsma et al. [23] that
uses information from the navigational logs of an
information system to reconstruct the system's spatial
dimensionality and metric. The method is based on the
spatial metaphor that the more users navigate between
any two items in an information system, the closer the
two items are positioned in the associated information
space. For example, if a request for Web page i is more
often followed by a request for Web page j than for a
request for other pages, i and j are considered ‘close’ to
each other. From the relative proximities of all Web
pages a spatial representation can then be computed. The
authors demonstrate the applicability of the approach
with empirical studies of a digital library of cartographic
materials [3] and an undergraduate engineering learning
information system [23]. In both cases an interpretable,
four-dimensional information space is reconstructed

from the system's navigational logs after which the
system's information items; e.g., web pages; are fitted
into this space.
Although the above method can be used to visualize
an information system’s use-space, this space remains
uniform and unmodeled. With this we mean to say that
although we can locate the information items in the
space, the space itself remains uniform, featureless and
contains no zones or regions. Yet, one could consider the
space around the information items basins of attraction;
i.e., spheres of influence or regions that are characterized
by some of the same properties as those of their central
items. A similar notion is present in the classic regional
geographical studies by Christaller [7], Isard [16], Berry
[2] and later by Huff [13] and Huff & Lutz [14]. For a
summary of some of these studies, refer to Hagget [12].
Interestingly, a byproduct of the method by Buttenfield
and Reitsma [3] is the estimation of a parameter for each
information item that can be interpreted as the relative
size or area of its sphere of influence. Hence, in this
paper we propose a method for reconstructing such
spheres of influence based on these given areas or sizes.
To accomplish this, we invert a classic spatial allocation
model, namely that of the multiplicatively weighted
Voronoi diagram (MWVD) [22]. First results are very
hopeful in that the model generates good fits.

Voronoi Diagrams
A classic way of regionalizing or allocating space
around a predetermined set of points or 'generators' is
Voronoi tessellation. This method is based on finding the
nearest generator for every point in the space. The
resultant regionalization is known as a Voronoi diagram
(VD). In a comprehensive presentation on the subject
including an extensive review of the literature, Okabe et
al. [22] present the ordinary VD as well many of its
generalizations. Figure 1 presents a few of the
characteristics of both the ordinary and multiplicatively
weighted Voronoi diagram.

For our objective of regionalizing an information
space based on the location of a set of information items
or generators and their predetermined area, the MWVD
is intuitively attractive. ‘Area’ or ‘size’ is a
multiplicative property, we want to allocate all of the
available space and we like the basins to grow as
uniformly as possible in all directions; i.e., we would like
to preserve their circular, disk-like shapes as much as
possible. Furthermore, the required computations are
simple, especially when carried out in a raster fashion.
However, the standard MWVD method has some
problems.

Inverse MWVDs
Our problem, i.e., to generate Voronoi regions
whose relative area sizes are known, is essentially the
inverse of the traditional MWVDs. Whereas for a
traditional MWVD area is the dependent variable, we
want to find a set of growth rates resulting in given area
ratios. This changes the problem from prediction to
optimization; i.e., compute regions such that their areas
optimally represent a predetermined set of values.
Since in the dynamic representation of a MWVD the
weights represent expansion rates, we can start by
adjusting area weights using (1).

area / S
(1)
However, this assumes unhindered, uniform and
omnidirectional growth, something which only applies
until equilibrium between adjacent generators is reached;
i.e., until two expanding generators 'meet.' It also does
not account for regional containment or nesting, a
phenomenon that occurs when one generator grows so
quickly that it envelops a slower growing, neighboring
generator (see the example in Figure 1B).

An additional problem concerns the areas associated
with peripheral generators. Since peripheral generators
can grow unchecked in the opposite direction of the
center of gravity of the generator configuration as a
whole, their areas become infinitely large. This problem,
of course, applies to VDs in general and is normally
resolved in either of two ways:

Characteristics: Borders are curved; regions
can surround other regions (if they grow fast
enough); regions can be disjoint.

x A set of auxiliary generators is regularly spaced
beyond the perimeter of the original generators.
When the VD gets solved, the regions associated
with the auxiliary regions will extend to infinity, but
the regions of the originally peripheral generators
now have boundaries. This is the approach that must
be used in convex hull applications such as qhull [1].
x Introduce an artificial outer boundary and limit
the growth of the external generators to these

boundaries. This is the approach used in most GIS
systems; e.g., ArcGIS or IDRISI [8].
In either case, outward growth of the peripheral
generators is limited by an ad hoc decision of the
modeler; either auxiliary generators are positioned at ad
hoc locations, or an ad hoc boundary is chosen.
Regardless of the solution, however, the areas of the
resulting regions are unlikely to properly reflect their
target values.
Table 1 (MWVD) illustrates the limiting success of
the above approach. It shows the average results of
computing MWVDs for 100 sets of N=25 points with
weights wj+1 = wj + 1, w0 = 1 and j = 0,1,...,N–1. To
prevent peripheral areas from attaining infinitely large
areas, a rectangular boundary was selected. Positional
information of the points was selected randomly from a
uniform distribution with a minimum of zero and a
maximum equal to the maximum coordinates of the
bounding rectangle. Table rows show four types of error:
correlation between weight and region area (r) and
minimum, average and maximum error where error is
defined as in (2).
Error = | Aj – aj| / Aj

ǻwj is positive if generator j received less area than
represented by w0,j; ǻwj is negative if too much area was
allocated. Weights at iteration i=0 represent the area
targets; Aj = w0,j. We define ai,j as the area allocated to
generator j after iteration i. Both Aj and ai,j are
proportions and are constrained by (4) and (5)
respectively.

Since the notion of a AMWVD is to continuously
adjust weights such that the difference Aj–ai,j gets
minimized, we suggest making ǻwj proportional to the
following three quantities:
1. wi,j ,
2. the difference in target and allocated areas Aj–ai,j,
and
3. a positive, nonzero scaling constant k.
After implementing these recommendations, we
obtain the following expression for adaptive weights
(6a):
wi+1,j = wi,j + wi,j k(Aj – ai,j)

(6a)

After regrouping of terms (6b):
wi+1,j = wi,j (1 + k(Aj – ai,j)).

(6b)

We offer the following heuristic for selecting k. The
worst case obtains when at some iteration i a region j
occupies almost all of the available space while having a
low weight, or when a region j occupies very little space
while having a high weight. Thus, the difference Aj–ai,j
lies between negative one and one (7):
–1 < Aj – ai,j < 1

(7)

After multiplying by k and adding 1, we obtain (8):

paired two-tailed t-test with p < 0.001

Note that for the MWVD the correlations do not
reach above .77 and that the adjustment of (1) does not
uniformly improve matters.

Adaptive Multiplicatively Weighted Voronoi
Diagrams (AMWVD)
To better approach predetermined area relationships
we propose an iterative, adaptive solution, where the
MWVD is solved repeatedly and for each new solution
the weight set is adapted based on the error of the
previous solution. This is represented by (3).
wi+1,j = wi,j + ǻwj

Accordingly, choosing k=1 is a safe default as it will
not result in negative weights. If we take k=1, (6b)
reduces to (9):
wi+1,j = wi,j (1 + Aj – ai,j)

(9)

However, it is important to note that for some data
sets k can be chosen larger than 1.0. In these cases the
difference Aj–ai,j may get minimized in fewer iterations
and the adaptive scheme converges more quickly.

Results
Table 1 (AMWVD) shows the results of using the
adaptive method for the same 100 generator point

configurations that were used to compute the ordinary
MWVDs (Table 1: MWVD). Runs of 1000 iterations
were made for starting weights w0,j = Aj and w0,j = ¥ Aj. k
was set to 1.0 for all runs. Comparing the values in
columns MWVD and AMWVD, all error measures using
the adaptive method are significantly better than those
using the regular MWVDs (p < 0.001).
Figure 2 shows data indicating how an AMWVD
solution for a random set of 25 points converges by
displaying the trajectory of the error measures used in
Table 1 and computed using (2) and the adaptive scheme
of (9). The graph shows that the correlation between
target area and allocated area (rAa) quickly approaches
1.0. However, the mean error takes quite a bit longer to
approach 0.0. The worst fitting region takes yet longer to
converge.

Conclusions
The methods described by Buttenfield and Reitsma
[3] and Reitsma et al. [23] provide a measure of the size
or area of basins of attraction in information space. In
reconstructing these basins MWVDs offer a good
starting point because their multiplicative nature reflects
the nature of the size measures and because it allows
generators to 'grab' space beyond neighboring generators
while preserving the principle of uniform growth in all
directions. We overcame the main disadvantage of the
MWVD; i.e., weights reflecting growth rate rather than
resultant area, by using an adaptive, iterative approach,
adjusting the weight set based on the error of the
previous solution.
Although we addressed this problem of
regionalization in the context of information space
reconstruction, we offer the method of AMWVDs as a
general model for spatial allocation subject to area
constraints. It would appear that such problems are quite
prevalent in physical and spatial planning. Indeed, any

nearest neighbor problem for which the basin of
attraction is limited by area; e.g., pizza delivery, mail
delivery and collection, crop harvesting, ambulance
services, search and rescue, planning of library rooms,
etc., could be modeled in this way.
