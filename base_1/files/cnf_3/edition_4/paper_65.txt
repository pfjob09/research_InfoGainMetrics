Abstract

there are a large number of collaborations within a research
area, we can expect innovative technologies in that field,
because such technologies are produced from the fusion of
multiple research areas. Examples include medical engineering, which covers the disciplines of medical science and
mechanical engineering.

In this study, we proposed the use of grant application
data to acquire knowledge of the relationships among scientific research subjects. We modeled grant application
data to construct a method of capturing the relationships
among research subjects, then conducted experiments using actual grant application data. The results indicated that
our method successfully elucidated the relationships among
research subjects.

Most previous research to elucidate the structure of science were conducted using publication data, which describes published scientific knowledge. One of the typical
approaches is to use citation information such as the cocitation network [10]. Chen and Paul used citation information from publication data to ascertain the structure of studies with respect to their impact on subsequent research [3].
Co-authorship networks in publication data can be useful
for identifying research groups. B¨orner et al., for example, utilized co-authorship networks in bibliography data
for this purpose [2], while Ichise et al. focused on mining research groups as communities [6, 5]. The abstracts of
research papers are also helpful materials for understanding
research domains. Skupin [8, 9] and Ichise et al. [4] utilized
abstracts to elucidate the relationships among research domains. However, one of the problems in using publication
data is publication bias; that is, the differences in publication style for each research domain. For example, there are
more journal publications in research domains such as biology, and fewer in others such as mathematics. As a result,
we are unable to compare different research domains using
publication data.

1 Introduction
Scientific knowledge is necessary for improving our
lives, and countless researchers labor to develop new scientific knowledge worldwide. Currently, the domain of scientific research covers a wide range, from traditional sciences
such as physics and mathematics, to new compound areas
such as nano-micro science and environmental science. As
a result, vast amounts of scientific knowledge are produced
very rapidly. In fact, the number of papers published has
increased more than seventy percent compared to 20 years
ago, according to the report of Testa [11].
It is difficult to comprehend the complex structure of science in its entirety from a large number of papers. However,
to construct research strategies for research and grant managers, it is useful to capture a complete sketch of current
scientific research. For example, if we can determine that

One of the standardized data across different research
domains is grant application data. Applications for research
grants are submitted using the same format, regardless of re-

search domain, and are also peer-reviewed by specialists as
for journal papers. Therefore, grant application data can be
useful for gathering information on scientific knowledge. In
this paper, we propose a method of analyzing research grant
data to determine the current condition of science.
The present paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, we describe and model grant data. In Section 3, we explain the proposed method for elucidating the relationships
among research domains. In Section 4, we describe actual
grant data from grants known as Kaken. In Section 5, we
describe the experimental evaluation of our method and discuss the results. Finally, in Section 6, we present our conclusions.

2 Model of grant data
Figure 1. Structure model of research grant
application data.

In this section, we describe a model of grant application
data. There are many types of research grants related to science; some are for pure scientific research, and others for
more practical investigations. Furthermore, there are differences in the responses to the required study purpose descriptions on grant applications. For example, research publications and current research trends play important roles in
grant applications for pure scientific research, while patents
and current social trends play important roles in applications for practical research.
In this study, we assumed the minimum elements of
grant application data, which includes the research category, name of the principal investigator, and the members
of research groups. The research category is usually used
in grant applications, because if the data is missing, peer
review cannot be performed. In other words, the category is required for selecting specialists to judge the application. Therefore, we assumed the category specified by
the author of the application. Research projects proposed
by grant applications are also sometimes conducted by research groups, which consist of one or more researchers.
We designated the primary researcher in the group as principal investigator and the rest of researchers as group members. By assuming these elements for grant applications, we
created a model of the data, as shown in Figure 1.
In the example shown in Figure 1, the relationships between categories, application documents and researchers
are connected by lines. There are three applications; two
submitted for category α and one for category β. The
application documents, which are proposals for research
projects, involve four researchers. In Figure 1, researcher
1 is the principal investigator of application A. This means
that the solid lines between application documents and
researchers represent principal investigators. In contrast,
the dotted lines represent the relationships between group
members and research projects. Researcher 2, for example,
is working on research projects in both applications A and

B, because he/she has two lines.

3 Relationships among several research subjects
When we model the structure of grant data, such as that
shown in Figure 1, we can identify interesting relationships
among the research subjects. For example, researcher 4 is
the principal investigator of application C, which is in category β in Figure 1. From this fact, we could consider researcher 4 to be a specialist in category β. However, he/she
is also a group member of application B, which is in category α. From this fact, we can also consider his/her role as
a knowledge provider who contributes to research category
α. As a result, we can identify interdisciplinary studies from
this modeling. Interdisciplinary studies have recently become important for developing innovative technology. For
example, genome science is an example of an interdisciplinary research area that involves biology, medical science,
informatics, and so on. Therefore, if we identify recent,
closely-working research domains, we may find innovative
technology areas in progress.
As mentioned previously, in order to find emerging interdisciplinary studies, we propose using the number of
researchers working for multiple research projects, such
as researcher 4 in Figure 1. We can thus measure the
closeness of research subjects and obtain graph structures
whose nodes represent the categories of research subjects
and whose arcs represent the relationships of research subjects. For example, in Figure 1, the nodes which represent category α and β are connected by an arc with one
weight, because researcher 4 connects the two research sub-

428

jects. Note that although researcher 2 is working for multiple research projects, he/she does not contribute to interdisciplinary studies because he/she works only in research category α. His/her contribution does not appear on the graph.

We utilized the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of
Japan in the present study, which is discussed in this section.
There are numerous research grants supported by the
Japanese government. The most popular grant for scientific research in Japan is the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research, hereafter designated as ’Kaken’, which is supported
by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and
the Ministry of Education, Culture , Sports, Science and
Technology (MEXT). We used Kaken application data as
our experimental data.
For each Kaken application document, applicants must
submit a research proposal, which includes the research
project title, names of principle investigator and group
members, research plan, requested budget, research category for peer-review, and so on. After submission, the research proposals are peer-reviewed and selected by the reviewer. The review process is impartially managed by JSPS
and MEXT.
Researchers have to complete application forms which
describe new research projects. There are several types
of Kaken, including general research, exploratory research,
grants for young scientists, and so on. In general, researchers can only apply for one research project per year
as a principal investigator; however, some types of Kaken
allow applicants to submit multiple projects. Therefore, applicants can be the principal investigator for more than one
research application. However, Kaken applications do not
limit the number of applications as a group member if the
researcher really join the project.
We modeled grant application data specified with the categories in the previous section. The research categories for
Kaken applications are organized into a hierarchy, as shown
in Figure 2. The research category hierarchy has three layers. The top layer has 11 research categories, which are
listed in Table 1, hereafter designated as research domains.
Each research domain has several subcategories. For example, the engineering domain includes electric and electronic
engineering and mechanical engineering, among others, as
shown in Figure 2. The subcategories of research domains
are hereafter designated as research fields. In the same manner, research fields also contain several subcategories, as
shown in Figure 2, which are hereafter designated as research subjects. A special research domain called temporary area (TA) includes temporal research subjects, which
are studies of high importance and requiring immediate fa-

cilitation. For example, allergy study is one of the subjects
in the TA domain for 2005 applications. Normally, the allergy study is categorized in the sub-area of immunology.
However, since allergy studies comprise a very small area
of immunology, it is hard to accept many research projects
if the applications are reviewed by the immunology community only. Since there are currently many patients suffering
from allergies, there is a need for this study to be facilitated. Therefore, these special subjects are temporarily set
up in TA domain. As a result, the TA area is a mixture of research across other domains. Thus, the TA is not organized
by research field; instead it is organized by research subject.

Experimental results

We created the graph using the method described in Section 3. When we did it, we utilized Pajek [1] with KamadaKawai model [7] option. In order to concentrate the nodes
on subjects in the same domain, we also added arcs (not
shown) within the domain. For example, we made connections for all 30 subjects included in the GA domain, although none of them are visualized. For simplicity, nodes
with less than 100 applications and arcs with less than 20
researchers were also eliminated.
The graph obtained from our method is shown in Figure
3. The size of the graph represents the number of applications and the shapes indicate the research domains. Values in the graph match the codes for research subjects. The
GA domain and the CA domain are the bridge research areas for multiple research subjects. In fact, these domains
contain subjects that have recently emerged to solve new
problems and develop new technologies. For these studies,
many types of knowledge, including chemistry, biology and
social sciences, are necessary for solutions in this research
area. For example, the research subject micro/nano devices
in the CA domain, which is represented by number 2103,
is an important area for the development of new technologies. We determined that the study requires knowledge of
thin film and surface interface physical properties (4902)
and electronic device/electronic equipment (5103) from the
graph obtained by our method, shown in Figure 3.
Using our method, we can successfully induce such
knowledge from grant data. In addition, we observed that
the MS domain, which is located in the lower left, has
many collaboration studies within the research domain, but
the research subjects in the BI domain, which is located in

The general statistical data from the applications used in
this experiment are shown in Table 3. The first column represents the number of applications in each research domain;
the second represents the number of principal investigators.
Generally, one application has one principal investigator;
therefore, the number of applications and principal investigators should be the same. However, the number of principal investigators is smaller because some researchers submitted several applications. The third column is the number
of researchers listed as group members in each research domain. The fourth column represents the total number of
principal investigators and group members in each domain,
including those with multiple applications. For example,
in GA domain, although there are 9547 principal investigators and 8330 group members, since these numbers included researchers on multiple Kaken applications, the total number of participants is actually higher than the sum
of both values. The fifth column represents the average
number of researchers working on one Kaken application,
which is important for determining the number of collaborations and identifying collaborative trends across research
domains. For example, there are 0.638 researchers, excepting the principal investigator, per application in the biology
domain (BI), and 1.265 per application in the compound
new area domain (CA). This indicates that subjects in CA
tend to involve more researchers to achieve the research purpose than those in BI.

the lower center, are practically independent from other research areas. This suggests that the MS domain is necessary
to integrate knowledge from multiple research domains, but
in the BI domain, research can be conducted with independent knowledge. We also determined that area study in CA,
which is represented by 2601, is a key research area within
many research fields in human science (HS) and social science (SS). Thus, CA is important for both domains.
Next, in order to discuss our results quantitatively, we
summarized the number of researchers related to multiple
research subjects. The number of researchers affects the
arcs in Figure 3, and is shown in Table 4. Research domains are shown in the top and left of the table; values represents the number of researchers who work for projects in
multiple research subjects. For example, a total of 1974
researchers are working for different subjects in the GA domain, and 754 researchers are working in both the GA and
CA domains. Note that, since research collaboration does
not have a direction in this study, Table 4 is symmetric. As
the arcs which have less than 20 researchers were already
eliminated, the graph has considerably fewer arcs compared

with the table. Generally speaking, the research domains of
GA and MS comprise a large amount of research across different subjects. However, the direction of interdisciplinary
research for these domains is slightly different. In the GA
domain, less than 20 % of research across multiple subjects
is conducted within the GA domain, but almost 60 % of MS
domain research is conducted across multiple subjects in
the MS domain. From this, the GA research domain plays
an important role in facilitating interdisciplinary research.
This phenomenon can also be seen in Figure 3. While there
are small numbers of interdisciplinary research activities in
the HS, CH and BI domains, according to Table 4, their
research tendencies are different. Most of the research is
related in particular areas of the HS and CH domains, but
is also to a wide variety in the BI domain. This tendency
can also be seen in Figure 3. In the HS and CH domains,
there are arcs connecting the different subjects, but in the BI
domain, there are few arcs. It is because the arcs are eliminated for relatively small collaboration compared to other
domains.

In the present study, we proposed the use of grant application data to acquire knowledge of the relationships among
scientific research subjects by modeling grant application
data and constructing a method to capture the relationships
among research subjects. We conducted experiments using actual application data from the Kaken grant. The results showed that our proposed method is able to elucidate
interesting relationships among research subjects, such as
progressive research in micro/nano device technology supported by thin film and surface interface physical properties
and electronic device/electronic equipment research. These
phenomena are evaluated quantitatively as well as qualitatively using this method.
Although the results are quite promising, further issues
remain, such as elucidating changes in research trends. We
consider that this issue can be solved by a comparison of
data for multiple years. Another issue is identifying promising areas of innovative interdisciplinary research. It is considered that such investigations arise from the collaboration
of talented individual researchers. Therefore, we intend to
integrate the technology proposed in this paper and mining
technologies on an individual level, such as that used by
[5, 4].
