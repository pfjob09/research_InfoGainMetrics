Abstract
Most applications in physical calculations provide
powerful multivariate outputs but use rather simple
visual representations (diagrams) without the
possibilities to explore the resulting data sets.
Interdependences in the data are overlooked or stay
unseen and the analysis is very time-consuming, because
of the difficulty and complexity for users to grasp the
results.
In this paper we present a tool which combines a
visual structure recognised by the physical community
with interactive information visualization techniques to
support the analysis of decay chain calculations. In a
case study we showed that our tool helped experts in the
field to analyse radioactive decay chains where the
representation of results is more concise and conclusions
are easier drawn.

(see Section 4) and the nuclide chart [13] (see Section 3).
They are well known and need no explanation in the
physical community. We explain how we adapted the
nuclide chart and introduce additional diagrams to
support cognition. Interactions are important to improve
the understanding of results. In Section 4 we describe
various interaction techniques to tune the visualization.
For time-oriented data exploration we propose
animations over time. First results and further application
scenarios are presented in Section 5.

2. Values and Dimensions
The data base for our case study consists of data
derived from simulation or calculation programs. The
programs implement either formulas, statistical methods,
or are based on measurements. The resulting output has
to be acquired or imported from a database or has to be
converted to fit our file standard.

1. Introduction

2.1. Thousands of Isotopes and Target Materials

There are various models and algorithms for
calculating radioactive products of nuclear physical
experiments. Most applications focus only on the
calculation and algorithmic simulation of processes. For
example Monte Carlo simulations [18] simulate particles
interacting with specific and complex geometries. The
output is usually a huge amount of raw data and has to be
imported or converted for analysis [19], [20]. This output
is not easy to understand and a lot of expert knowledge is
needed to interpret key results. The analysis is time
consuming and the presentation of results is usually
difficult.
Information Visualization’s strengths are to treat
multivariate data sets and allow users to explore and to
understand this data in a visual way. Our goal is to show
how visual representation and interaction methods
improve the tasks of analyzing and communicating
simulations and results. Therefore, we use Information
Visualization approaches in combination with visual
structures that are well known and accepted by the
physical community. Our case study is based on physical
models from a Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) facility.
In Section 2 we explain important values and
dimensions and their combinations as well as describe
methods to warn the user if the results divert from
expected behavior. Physicists use well known visual
structures to encode elements and isotopes. We use two
of these: the periodic table [15] of chemical elements

Our case study takes values that describe the
production of isotopes in a RIB facility during the
irradiation of a target. Every irradiation produces up to
thousands of different radioactive isotopes. Figuratively,
the atom core of a target atom is hit and breaks into
several fragments leading to new chemical elements. For
example, a Lanthanum (La) atom has 57 protons and
could break into a fragment with 55 protons, which is
then Cesium. If this process happens often (millions of
times per second), statistically all elements smaller than
the target elements are produced. The chemical
properties of an atom depend on the number of protons
and define its chemical name. The physical properties
depend on the number of neutrons in the core. Atoms
belonging to the same element or chemical type have the
same number of protons but can have different numbers
of neutrons, they are said to be isotopes of a given
element. The convention is to identify an atom by the
total number of particles in the core (protons + neutrons)
and its chemical name (e.g. 118 Cesium has 55 protons
and 63 neutrons).
In short, we have to consider and find a
representation for all types of produced isotopes and we
also have to show how many atoms of each isotope are
generated.

2.2. Irradiation and Decay
The irradiation is the process of shooting the proton
beam on the target. The relevant information is the
irradiation time, the beam intensity and the beam energy.
The time indicates how long the target is hit by protons
and the intensity states the number of protons that hit the
target (per unit time). During our work we used one
second as our time unit. A typical value for the
irradiation time is one day (86400 seconds). As a
simplification we assume a constant beam energy and
intensity. (These values are part of the settings in the
simulation tools and are therefore not relevant for the
visual processing.) However, the irradiation time is very
important to see the transient evolution and to compare
targets during different irradiation periods.
Every unstable isotope decays [16] and therefore
results in another isotope. We consider in our case study
only alpha (Į), beta minus (ȕ-) and beta plus (ȕ+) decay.
This information for every isotope is static and can be
found in tables that contain the branching ratios and
decay probability of radioactive isotopes. The decay
probability leads to the half-life of an isotope. The halflife is the time during which half of the isotopes decay.
Half-lives can be fractions of a second to thousands of
years. (I.e. Cesium 115 has a half-life of 1.4 seconds,
whereas Cesium 137’s half-life is around 30 years.)

2.3. Time
We have to distinguish two time axes. First, during
irradiation the exploration and calculation can be done
along a linear time axis. I.e. the visualization shows 10
seconds, then the next 10 seconds etc. This is sufficient
because the irradiation time is usually short compared to
the decay time. The irradiation period is usually a few
days whereas the decay has to be calculated for several
years.
Second, due to the fact that the half-lives vary from
seconds to years, the time axis for the decay time has to
be logarithmic.

laboratories (A, B, C), with A being the highest and
where highly radioactive materials can be treated. A goal
of the visualization is to show the user immediately in
which laboratory class the target can be stored or
dismantled. The LA values could be replaced by other
limits and therefore the visualization could serve for
other purposes.

3. Visualization Approach
For visualizing all these values we first had a look at
already existing visualizations. Having compared
different possible Information Visualization methods, we
concluded that a combination of already existing
visualizations, supported by small multiples [4] and
interaction techniques would meet our needs best.
Finally, we implemented an animation of irradiation and
decay (over a defined time) to support the exploration
process as well as to allow the non-computer scientists to
easily see and understand the changes of time (Section
4.2).

3.1. Nuclide Chart
A well know and often used way of showing
isotopes is the nuclide chart [1] (see Figure 1). Each
isotope (or so called nuclide) is presented as one square.
The squares are vertically arranged according to the
isotope’s number of protons. The horizontal axis
represents the number of neutrons. The coloring of the
squares stands for the different decay modes. Yellow
signals Į decay, red ȕ+ and light blue ȕ- (see Figure 1).
Additional information such as mass, half-life, etc is
written in each square.

2.4. Limits
The goal is usually to compare the results to
governmental, physical, toxicological, and chemical
limits. In this paper we use the Swiss limits of
authorization [17] (LA values), which regulate and
categorize the treatment of radioactive materials. There
is a defined value for each dangerous isotope, which is
multiplied by the actual activity (decays per second). The
resulting values are then summed and define the required
laboratory classification. There exist three classes of

Figure 1 – Nuclide Chart – A section of the
Karlsruher nuclide chart [1]. The decays are shown
by the arrows. Elements along the diagonal have
the same mass; the sum of neutrons and protons is
the same.

Figure 2 – Overview – Number and variety of produced isotopes of a tantalum target after 151 seconds of
irradiation are shown. The time is indicated in the right lower corner. In the lower center there is a symbol that
indicates irradiation (compare Figure 4). Every square in the nuclide chart represents one produced isotope.
The color coding stands, in this case, for the amount of atoms for every element. The control buttons can be
used to explore the data sets along the time axis (Irradiate, Decay). The black lines emphasizing certain rows
and columns are called “magic lines”. They indicate a physical phenomenon of particular stable isotopes.
We decided to use the nuclide chart layout as a base
for our visualization and use the color coding not for
showing the decay modes but for showing number of
atoms, activities or limits. Therefore, we chose ten colors
to indicate certain thresholds (compare Figure 2). The
underlying grid is the simulation output of the heaviest
element (92 protons) used in RIB facilities.
The nuclide chart layout is very common in the
physics community and therefore easy to understand for
physicists.
In our case study the nuclide chart is used to show
values at a given time point, resulting in a picture. A user
can navigate (irradiate or decay) along the time axis and
gets a picture for every time point. The color coding can
be changed to show another dimension with smaller
thresholds.

3.2. Additional Small Multiples
The nuclide chart on its own is not sufficient for all
the values we want to treat (Section 2). We added
additional small charts [1] (see Figure 3), which show
the evolution of general target properties by adding the
sum of all relevant values to the chart. The x-axis
represents time and the y-axis the summed values that
are visualized. The axes are logarithmic due to the fact
that time is evolving on a logarithmic basis and the

values can become very big. Labels below the diagrams
indicate the actual value. In our example the three
diagrams show the evolution of all produced isotopes
(labeled by “SumN”), the total activity (labeled by
“SumAct”and the total LA values (labeled by
“SumLA”).
These diagrams help to grasp the evolution of the
target during the exploration. They also help to debug the
application in a simple way. If one diagram is diverging
it indicates an inconsistency in the data or a bug in the
program. Smooth looking diagrams do not automatically
indicate correct data, but divergences can be seen easily.
For example, the parameter “SumN” has to stay constant
during decay, because every element that decays
becomes another isotope. Therefore, the decay has no
effect on the parameter “SumN”.
The most important value (for our case study) is the
LA value. Connected to this value there is a colored text
box that indicates the classification of the target
(compare Figure 3). The user sees immediately how
dangerous a target is and in which type of laboratory it
should be treated (if LA  10000 then Class A, if LA
100 then Class B, and if LA < 100 then Class C).

Figure 4 – Irradiation Symbol – Icon sequence
that indicates the irradiation period. These symbols
are shown left of the time indication (compare
Figure 2).

4.3. Zoom and Filter
There are two possibilities to change the level of
detail within the visual representation. The first one is
zooming (see Figure 5).

Figure 3 – Small Multiples – Charts with
logarithmic X and Y axes. They indicate the total
number of produced isotopes (Sum N), the total
activity (decays per second) and the total LA.
Directly connected to the total LA is a label that
classifies the target. This example shows a target
that has to be treated in a class B lab.

4. The Exploration Process (Interaction)
To gain insight into the calculated values and to
explore the target, there are possibilities to interact with
the visualization system.

4.1. Interaction on the Temporal Level
First, the basic feature is to step forward in time,
either by irradiating the target or decaying it. This is
done by pressing either on the “Irradiate” or “Decay”
button (see Figure 2), resulting in the calculation and
visualization of the values according to the next time
step. Another possibility is to trigger an automatic
calculation by clicking the “Auto” button. This starts an
automatic procedure that can be pre-defined.

4.2. Animation
The generated pictures can be saved and then be
used for a video. This shows the production and decay of
isotopes in time. The user can play the video back and
forth and see interesting transitions several times, go
back or slow down the animation.
If the target is irradiated (shot by protons) there is a small
icon left of the time indicator (compare Figure 4 and
Figure 2). This icon changes from picture to picture,
showing (in the animation) a proton breaking an atom
core.

Figure 5 – Zoom – A zoomed area, revealing
additional information (semantic zooming), is
shown. Every square shows now also the number
of neutrons (N) of the element.
According to a selection (as seen in Figure 5) the
nuclide chart boundaries are updated and redrawn. The
new view does reveal additional information, i.e. the
number of neutrons of every element. This technique is
called semantic zooming [2], [12] and helps to look at
details of singles isotopes. The more one zooms in, the
more information is revealed. If the next time step is
calculated, all elements (including those that are not
viewable) are considered and included in the calculation.
This makes it possible to zoom back out and explore all
isotopes in an overview, zoom in again, explore, zoom
out etc.
The second interaction possibility is a filter [2]
which allows selecting some special chemical elements.
We use a periodic table to make this selection (compare
Figure 6).
Only the selected elements are shown in the nuclide
chart (compare Figure 7). In contrast to zooming,
filtering removes all unselected values from the
algorithm and are therefore no longer included in further
exploring and calculating. Zooming can be used to obtain
insight whereas filtering is used to remove uninteresting
elements and therefore simplifies the overview.

chains. We could validate their correctness. In a future
step we will perform a more in-depth evaluation,
analyzing the power of our visualization on a cognitive
level as well as assessing the usefulness of the prototype
to accomplish particular tasks. We will compare the
results derived by our visualization prototype with results
by conventional tools.

5.2 Operational Area
Figure 6 – Filter Selection – If one is interested in
the evolution of certain elements, these elements
can be filtered using a periodic table [15]. By
clicking on a chemical element it is selected.

The tool presented here is the first step of a
framework that is capable of calculating and presenting
production rates, releases, yields etc. for RIB facilities.
At this stage the tool is used to estimate the activity and
LA values of used targets for the transport and disposal
of radioactive materials from CERN. The resulting
videos are a crisp way of showing what happens during
irradiation and storage (decay). Another operational area
is the estimation of expected radiation for all kinds of
physical experiments including proton beam - target
interactions. The software is used to visualize the activity
of parts that are activated during irradiation and how
long they have to be stored before humans are allowed to
handle them.
This tool will also be used for the planning of future RIB
facilities at CERN and will be used to present
calculations for the EURISOL design study [21].

6. Related Work
Figure 7 – Showing Filtered Parameters – The
chosen selection of Figure 6 is shown. The rest of
the elements are omitted. One element in the
periodic table corresponds to one line in the nuclide
chart; therefore, only lines can be filtered.
In contrast to common filter techniques [2], we use a
“positive” filtering method. The user has to explicitly
select the values she wants to see and all others are
omitted.

5. Prototype - Testing
A prototype was implemented and was presented to
experts. These experts not only evaluated the prototype
but they also gave us hints and ideas of where this
implementation could be used.

5.1 Scenario-based Evaluation
First, the basic concept and the different interaction
techniques were explained and second, a small example
was recorded and the animation was shown to domain
experts. We were quite astonished that the domain
experts never used any kind of visualization to explore
the evolution of decay chains. In particular the
animations were very well received and explain the
process in a crisp and quick way.
In the next step, we compared the results of our
visualization tool to (simple) measurements of decay

The starting point of our application is the output of
a program from Silberberg and Tsao [14]. It is a
collection of measurement data. We use this output as a
basis for our calculations and visualization. The data are
converted and reformatted to meet our needs. The data
we are dealing with are time-oriented data.
Different kinds of Information Visualization
methods were proposed to deal with time-oriented data.
These techniques range from simple time-series
representations [4] over multi-axis representations, such
as Star Graphs [6] or Parallel Coordinates [7], [8] to
sophisticated techniques, such as MultiComb [9],
Timewheel techniques [10], or angular brushing of
Parallel Coordinates [11]. We were aiming to provide a
simple, but intuitive visualization technique our experts
are used to work with (nuclide chart). Therefore, we
investigate the visualization techniques as used in the
well-known film finder project [2], [3]. We wanted the
user to explore the data sets starting from an overview
and then drilling down and focusing to interesting
regions of the data. Consequently, semantic zooming and
filtering methods seemed most appropriate for our
approach. However, we need to adapt these methods to
be applicable for our application domain. Furthermore,
we need to focus on particular ways to deal with timeoriented data. Therefore, two possible ways to deal with
time-oriented data need to be considered:
(1) A step by step approach from one time point to
the next, or

(2) The generation of a movie (animation) to show
an exploration procedure over time.
At CERN there are many other calculation codes
used for calculating particle interactions. One of them is
FLUKA [18]. It is a Monte Carlo simulation and focuses
only on the calculation part. However, it could be
possible to use FLUKA as a basis for our visual tool. The
advantage would be the higher precision of the
calculation. The disadvantages are the huge data sets,
calculation time and the not very user friendly interfaces
(scripting). We believe that for our purpose our own
calculation algorithm is sufficient, but we could still use
FLUKA output as input data for our visualization.

Conclusions
Exploring decay chains of radioactive isotopes is a
time-consuming and complicated task. Usually, the
domain experts are confronted with a huge amount of
numerical and time-oriented data and dependency
functions.
We try to support those tasks by providing
Information Visualization techniques. In particular, we
are utilizing visual structures the domain experts are used
to work with and enhance them with context- and taskspecific interaction methods. The amount of produced
atoms, limits of authorization and activities are shown
during decay and irradiation. This leads to a quick grasp
of what is going on when irradiating and decaying targets
over a period of time.
A valuable statement results form the display of the
laboratory classification (green, yellow, red), in which a
target has to be treated according to its sum of limits of
authorization. This case is only an example and can be
adapted for other classification.
The validation of the results is eased by three small
diagrams which are plotted on double logarithmic scales
to show the evolution of the sum of atoms as well as
limits of authorization and activities.
Zooming to special values and revealing the
absolute values allows an expert to find out which
elements are the most dangerous and why a sum of
activity (decays per second) or LA occurred. These
features enable the domain experts to analyze different
kinds of data constellation and provide an in-depth
analysis.
The possibility to filter or to select only certain
elements is a feature that can speed up the exploration by
focusing on single elements. We specifically
implemented a positive filtering (the user selects the
items of interest), because often one is only interested in
a certain element.
As the next step, our approach will be intensively
used in the planning for future experiments, RIB
facilities, and radiation calculations.
