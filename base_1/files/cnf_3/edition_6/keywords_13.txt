Interdependences in the data are overlooked or stay, because of the difficulty and complexity for users to grasp the results. In this paper we present a tool which combines a visual structure recognised by the physical community with interactive information visualization techniques to support the analysis of decay chain calculations. In a case study we showed that our tool helped experts in the field to analyse radioactive decay chains where the representation of results is more concise and conclusions are easier drawn., unseen and the analysis is very time-consuming, Application software, Atomic measurements, Chemical elements, Data visualization, Information analysis, Interactive systems, Isotopes, Neutrons, Protons, Radioactive decay
