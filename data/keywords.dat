data analysis, data visualisation, physics computing, radioactive decay schemes, data analysis, data interdependency, decay chain calculation analysis, interactive information visualization, physical calculations, radioactive decay chains, task-oriented visualization, visual representation, most applications in physical calculations provide powerful multivariate outputs but use rather simple visual representations (diagrams) without the possibilities to explore the resulting data sets. interdependences in the data are overlooked or stay, because of the difficulty and complexity for users to grasp the results. in this paper we present a tool which combines a visual structure recognised by the physical community with interactive information visualization techniques to support the analysis of decay chain calculations. in a case study we showed that our tool helped experts in the field to analyse radioactive decay chains where the representation of results is more concise and conclusions are easier drawn., unseen and the analysis is very time-consuming, application software, atomic measurements, chemical elements, data visualization, information analysis, interactive systems, isotopes, neutrons, protons, radioactive decay
